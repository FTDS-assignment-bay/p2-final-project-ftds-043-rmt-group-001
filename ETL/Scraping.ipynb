It has almost all the functions you wished for a smart sports tracker and health monitor. The steps it counts is more than that of my iPhone watch 10, similar with Fitbit Charge 4. The good part is Huawei device can update the Steps in Apple Health but not other informations. I like the detail information it catches for swimming, including segments, charts and details. So does the Sleep monitor which provides detail graphic, description and analysis on the quality of your sleep. The sleep data are precise and accurate, even captures the nap minutes I take during a day. I captured a few shots of the watch screens as well as the a few ones from Huawei Health App. The sports activities in the watch only have a few common ones, no others, such table tennis, tennis, badminton or pickle ball, etc. the good part is you don’t need subscription. In all, a great smart sports tracking device for a non-professional sport enthusiast. The quality and value over the price is very good.',\n",

Looks/Material2. Responsive screen3. Love the closing mechanism of the wrist band (and the color...)4. Fairly impressive HRM. I've worn a chest HRM for comparison and generally impressed that the Huawei reacts to sudden exercise spurts or cool down as quickly and accurately as a chest strap - sometimes faster. But there are also times when it's totally off and it takes a couple minutes before it picks up the correct HR5. Love the training load, HRV, Recovery, VO2Max metrics6. I like that it has no GPS of its own. Makes the battery last longer and the watch will stream the GPS data from my phoneCON or NOT SO GREAT1. 1000's of watch faces - yet very few that are clean, modern, ergonomic. AND very few that can be customized. Thus no watch face that displays what I want and not what I don't want2. Often ridiculously small font, impossible to read without a magnifying glass3. A bit frustrating that some info is only on the watch, some only on the app4. As others pointed out, seems you can only start exercise via app, not via watch itself5. No Afib detection6. Very hard to find explanations of the metrics or how to adjust menus\",\n",

I've had the watch for a little over a month and it stopped being able to record laps correctly. I wasn't THAT upset because I still used it to monitor my heartrate in the pool. Instead of doing intervals strictly based on time, I was going by my heart rate. But then that function eventually broke too. Now it's a glorified step counter, but I suspect that feature might break soon as well. At that point it'll just be a watch with really limited features compared to higher end smart watches.\",\n",

       "   {'review': 'The normal Huawei product, very special, very robust, great APP, and a great addition to my Huawei family of watches.  I wear the D Watch for sleep in order to take my blood pressure throughout the night.  This product is one I wear during the day on days where I wear my silver Oura ring.  It is accurate and gorgeous.  On other days, I wear my Cyber GT with one of the multitude of bands and faces available for that watch.  I love Huawei.  But I only gave four stars for a couple reasons:  First, the APP has problems tracking three watches and tends to delete one of them when not in use.  Garmin would never do that and I hope Huawei fixes it.  Second, this GT-5 gets disconnected from the APP occasionally, which is aggravating.  Perhaps it is a problem with my bluetooth settings on my Pixel phone.  I will check.  But overall this is a great watch and -- knowing how great Huawei is -- I am sure it will ultimately fix the two bugs.',\n",

Me gustaba mas el menú radial del Frontier y la corona para trabajar. pero te acostumbras al nuevo menú y a manejarte con el botón giratorio.2 cosas me molestan únicamente, no tiene wifi, asique es dependiente de la conexión bluethoo con el celular.. lo cual es una cagada, por que capaz que dejas el celu cargando y se desconecta, siendo que se podría conectar a la red del hogar. y la segunda.. esa estúpida postura de las empresas de cerrarse en su universo. por ejemplo para usar el disparador de cámara remota Tenes que bajarte la cámara de Huawei... que para Samsung es paga o llena de propaganda..lo mismo con las appsFuera de estas dos situaciones.. anda muyy lindo y muy bien logrado.',\n",

I don\\'t know. I just don\\'t see where other reviewers are having issues. The watch is awesome and the battery lasts a surprisingly long time compared to other watches I\\'ve tried.The only thing I recommend is, when you register everything, make sure to say you are in a different country besides the USA. If you register as from the US, you won\\'t have access to the huge variety of face designs they have. But it\\'s understandable, they haven\\'t exactly been nice to Huawei. *shrug*',\n",

       "   {'review': 'I have been wearing this watch for a full week and can honestly say this is way better than my older Apple Watch.  My Apple Watch 3 was going on 5 yrs old and was no longer holding a charge for more than 6 hours. I wanted a new smart watch but was hesitant to shell out $400 for a new Apple 10.  After a lot of research I decided to try the Huawei Fit 3 but I was concerned there were few reviews posted from a US based user.  So here’s my take on this interesting watch:Pros:  1.  Amazing battery life.  After first full week of daily usage, battery was at 33%.  Let’s see an Apple Watch match that.  2.  Seamless connection with my Apple 14 phone.  Leave the Health app open on your phone and it works perfectly.  I took a 2 mile walk with my new and old watches shortly after getting the Huawei, and both tracked the same exact distance .  3.  History of your exercise and health records tracks closely with those used by Apple.  Looks a bit different from Apple but the data is there.  4.  The watch face I have posted a photo of is great- it provides me with all the data I want on a smart watch on one screen- steps, bpm, weather, time,  date, battery life and  even Sp02.  5.  Price- I paid $155 for this watch and to me, this is a way better value than a $400 Apple 10.  6.  Accessories.  I purchased watch face covers and bands specific to the Fit 3 and they are interchangeable just like my old Apple 3.Cons:  No way to control your music or podcasts from the Huawei watch like you can on an Apple Watch.  For some folks, I can see why this could be a deal breaker, but not for me.I hope this review helps anyone considering this watch in the US.  After 1 full week, I have no regrets opting for the Huawei Fit 3 over other watches made by Apple, Garmin and Fitbit.  You get a lot more watch for a lot less $$$.',\n",

But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label. Luckily I was able to return it.\",\n",

The battery is better as well. I also like the larger face size. Being able to customize the watch face to my specific needs was essential, and I can do this with this watch. I did have to buy a program to do that, but it was well worth the $20. Facemaker is the name of the program if other's want to do the same. I get a full week use out of the battery with 4 1 hour (average) workouts a week. I actually have about 20% left at the 1 week point. Heart rate seems to be accurate, although it only checks it once a minute (settable in the app). For workouts it seems to display heart rate in real time which I care about more than when I am not working out. The app that the watch uses is pretty good. It actually provides a LOT more information than I care about. The only thing I have found that I wish was better is having the ability to edit the workout face. You can edit the data and where that data displays, but you can't edit the size of each data display. I would really like to be able to do this. Even better would be the ability to edit the workout face in the app, as opposed to only on the watch. I have only had this a couple of weeks so there may be more I discover that I like or dislike. I will update if needed, but for now I can fully recommend this watch as a valid replacement for much higher priced watches.\",\n",

It was simple to connect this watch to my Android; it's compatible. Just make sure you go in to set the language to English. Also, you must download the app. I like the black color.

I tend to break the screen of my other watches and this one is holding up strong! It even offers AI coaching for fitness. You can choose from tons of face watches to match your personal style.

It has almost all the functions you wished for a smart sports tracker and health monitor. The steps it counts is more than that of my iPhone watch 10, similar with Fitbit Charge 4. The good part is Huawei device can update the Steps in Apple Health but not other informations. I like the detail information it catches for swimming, including segments, charts and details. So does the Sleep monitor which provides detail graphic, description and analysis on the quality of your sleep. The sleep data are precise and accurate, even captures the nap minutes I take during a day. I captured a few shots of the watch screens as well as the a few ones from Huawei Health App. The sports activities in the watch only have a few common ones, no others, such table tennis, tennis, badminton or pickle ball, etc. the good part is you don’t need subscription. In all, a great smart sports tracking device for a non-professional sport enthusiast. The quality and value over the price is very good.',\n",

The screen is crisp, the battery life is phenomenal, and it handles daily tracking with precision and ease.What impressed me most is the blend of premium design and performance. It doesn’t just look good—it works well. Notifications are timely, fitness tracking is accurate, and the range of features feels thoughtful rather than bloated.The only drawback—and it’s worth noting—is the limitation on downloading new watch faces if you’re based in the U.S. That feature could add even more personalization, but even with the existing selection, it’s still a joy to use. Despite that, I prefer the GT5 hands-down over my previous Amazfit and Garmin.If you’re on the fence about upgrading, this watch doesn’t just keep time—it makes the time feel well spent.',\n",

The battery life for all the features it has is the standard that all the other brands need to follow. Until then, it is the best bang for money. Looks very stylish and modern.

I wear the D Watch for sleep in order to take my blood pressure throughout the night.  This product is one I wear during the day on days where I wear my silver Oura ring.  It is accurate and gorgeous.  On other days, I wear my Cyber GT with one of the multitude of bands and faces available for that watch.  I love Huawei.  But I only gave four stars for a couple reasons:  First, the APP has problems tracking three watches and tends to delete one of them when not in use.  Garmin would never do that and I hope Huawei fixes it.  Second, this GT-5 gets disconnected from the APP occasionally, which is aggravating.  Perhaps it is a problem with my bluetooth settings on my Pixel phone.  I will check.  But overall this is a great watch and -- knowing how great Huawei is -- I am sure it will ultimately fix the two bugs.',\n",

I have tattoos on my hands and wrists rendering most smart watches useless when it comes to reading my heart rate. But this watch actually does read it. I\\'m not sure how accurate it is, but at least I don\\'t get the classic \"---\" reading.It\\'s actually pretty easy to setup and get going. Maybe it\\'s because I\\'m slightly tech-savvy? I don\\'t know. I just don\\'t see where other reviewers are having issues. The watch is awesome and the battery lasts a surprisingly long time compared to other watches I\\'ve tried.The only thing I recommend is, when you register everything, make sure to say you are in a different country besides the USA. If you register as from the US, you won\\'t have access to the huge variety of face designs they have. But it\\'s understandable, they haven\\'t exactly been nice to Huawei. *shrug*',\n",

       "   {'review': 'I have been wearing this watch for a full week and can honestly say this is way better than my older Apple Watch.  My Apple Watch 3 was going on 5 yrs old and was no longer holding a charge for more than 6 hours. I wanted a new smart watch but was hesitant to shell out $400 for a new Apple 10.  After a lot of research I decided to try the Huawei Fit 3 but I was concerned there were few reviews posted from a US based user.  So here’s my take on this interesting watch:Pros:  1.  Amazing battery life.  After first full week of daily usage, battery was at 33%.  Let’s see an Apple Watch match that.  2.  Seamless connection with my Apple 14 phone.  Leave the Health app open on your phone and it works perfectly.  I took a 2 mile walk with my new and old watches shortly after getting the Huawei, and both tracked the same exact distance .  3.  History of your exercise and health records tracks closely with those used by Apple.  Looks a bit different from Apple but the data is there.  4.  The watch face I have posted a photo of is great- it provides me with all the data I want on a smart watch on one screen- steps, bpm, weather, time,  date, battery life and  even Sp02.  5.  Price- I paid $155 for this watch and to me, this is a way better value than a $400 Apple 10.  6.  Accessories.  I purchased watch face covers and bands specific to the Fit 3 and they are interchangeable just like my old Apple 3.Cons:  No way to control your music or podcasts from the Huawei watch like you can on an Apple Watch.  For some folks, I can see why this could be a deal breaker, but not for me.I hope this review helps anyone considering this watch in the US.  After 1 full week, I have no regrets opting for the Huawei Fit 3 over other watches made by Apple, Garmin and Fitbit.  You get a lot more watch for a lot less $$$.',\n",

But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label. Luckily I was able to return it.\",\n",

The battery is better as well. I also like the larger face size. Being able to customize the watch face to my specific needs was essential, and I can do this with this watch. I did have to buy a program to do that, but it was well worth the $20. Facemaker is the name of the program if other's want to do the same. I get a full week use out of the battery with 4 1 hour (average) workouts a week. I actually have about 20% left at the 1 week point. Heart rate seems to be accurate, although it only checks it once a minute (settable in the app). For workouts it seems to display heart rate in real time which I care about more than when I am not working out. The app that the watch uses is pretty good. It actually provides a LOT more information than I care about. The only thing I have found that I wish was better is having the ability to edit the workout face. You can edit the data and where that data displays, but you can't edit the size of each data display. I would really like to be able to do this. Even better would be the ability to edit the workout face in the app, as opposed to only on the watch. I have only had this a couple of weeks so there may be more I discover that I like or dislike. I will update if needed, but for now I can fully recommend this watch as a valid replacement for much higher priced watches.\",\n",

I wear the D Watch for sleep in order to take my blood pressure throughout the night.  This product is one I wear during the day on days where I wear my silver Oura ring.  It is accurate and gorgeous.  On other days, I wear my Cyber GT with one of the multitude of bands and faces available for that watch.  I love Huawei.  But I only gave four stars for a couple reasons:  First, the APP has problems tracking three watches and tends to delete one of them when not in use.  Garmin would never do that and I hope Huawei fixes it.  Second, this GT-5 gets disconnected from the APP occasionally, which is aggravating.  Perhaps it is a problem with my bluetooth settings on my Pixel phone.  I will check.  But overall this is a great watch and -- knowing how great Huawei is -- I am sure it will ultimately fix the two bugs.',\n",

From the moment I put it on, the comfort, style, and intuitive interface made it feel like it belonged on my wrist. The screen is crisp, the battery life is phenomenal, and it handles daily tracking with precision and ease.What impressed me most is the blend of premium design and performance. It doesn’t just look good—it works well. Notifications are timely, fitness tracking is accurate, and the range of features feels thoughtful rather than bloated.The only drawback—and it’s worth noting—is the limitation on downloading new watch faces if you’re based in the U.S. That feature could add even more personalization, but even with the existing selection, it’s still a joy to use. Despite that, I prefer the GT5 hands-down over my previous Amazfit and Garmin.If you’re on the fence about upgrading, this watch doesn’t just keep time—it makes the time feel well spent.',\n",

There are only a handful of faces available with very ugly design since the App does not feature the \"Add watch faces\" option that is available for Android users, which seems unacceptable to me. I already updated the software of the watch to the last version and it\\'s not the problem.Other thing that is bothering is that although the bracelet is made with great attention to detail, it does not allow to fine adjust it, so It can be very loose or very tight on your wrist. Seiko bracelets, a tenth percent of this quality, allow to do this.',\n",

       "   {'review': \"First of all, the watch by itself looks gorgeous.  They could have been amazing in terms of functionality. But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label. Luckily I was able to return it.\",\n",

The battery is better as well. I also like the larger face size. Being able to customize the watch face to my specific needs was essential, and I can do this with this watch. I did have to buy a program to do that, but it was well worth the $20. Facemaker is the name of the program if other's want to do the same. I get a full week use out of the battery with 4 1 hour (average) workouts a week. I actually have about 20% left at the 1 week point. Heart rate seems to be accurate, although it only checks it once a minute (settable in the app). For workouts it seems to display heart rate in real time which I care about more than when I am not working out. The app that the watch uses is pretty good. It actually provides a LOT more information than I care about. The only thing I have found that I wish was better is having the ability to edit the workout face. You can edit the data and where that data displays, but you can't edit the size of each data display. I would really like to be able to do this. Even better would be the ability to edit the workout face in the app, as opposed to only on the watch. I have only had this a couple of weeks so there may be more I discover that I like or dislike.

       "   {'review': 'If you’re looking to purchase a smart watch that is affordable and it has all the bills and whistles other smart watches have then check this out. If you have an android or an iPhone, no worries this watch is actually compatible with both. You can also monitor your heart rate, steps taken and so much more. Setting up the watch is really easy and they connect via Bluetooth. Since I love working out, this is one of the features that I really enjoyed. It has more than 140 workouts something that the other smart watches do not have and it’s at a fraction of the cost, which makes it even better. There’s also an app that you can download that allows you to monitor your food intake. One of the great functions that this watch has is the ability to make and receive phone calls as well as text messages. A battery life on the watch is amazing. You can get up to 14 days depending on your usage. This is something I was not able to accomplish with my other smart watch.',\n",

       "   {'review': \"This watch does well, considered the price. The functions and capabilities are pretty good. The watch face is a nice size for those who need larger texts. The band width is a bit snug. I wish they'd offer larger bands. My major squarm is the battery life when active. The watch has to be charged every four days. My Fitbit would last well over a week before it needed a charge. I do like that you can text and answer calls from your arm. The charging port could be a bit more user convenient. It was simple to connect this watch to my Android; it's compatible. Just make sure you go in to set the language to English. Also, you must download the app. I like the black color. The watch face is easily scratched though. I swam with it and it did well. Overall, it's a pretty decent watch.\",\n",

The long battery life is a huge reason why I love this watch. I have had it on for weeks and it’s still at 1/2 battery level. It’s functional and has everything that you could want in a smart watch, and more. You can get all your notifications on this watch, GPS, make phone calls, and send replies. It has so many health tracking features like different workout modes, sleep metrics, blood oxygen, stress, and heart rate. It’s user friendly and easy to see notifications on the display, even in bright daylight. It is water resistant and very durable. I tend to break the screen of my other watches and this one is holding up strong! It even offers AI coaching for fitness. You can choose from tons of face watches to match your personal style. The screen size looks a little large for my small wrist but it doesn’t feel bulky when on. Overall this watch is amazing. If you are looking to get a smart watch I would definitely recommend this one; yes even over the leading brands. Oh and there is no subscription fee!',\n",
