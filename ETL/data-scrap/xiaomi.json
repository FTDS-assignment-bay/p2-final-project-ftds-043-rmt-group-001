I turned off the call and text notifications right away so I don't have the distraction. The price is amazing for the capabilities. It actually has more capabilities that are useful and make my everyday life more convenient. I really just wanted it to track my sleep and it does a great job!Specs that I like:- battery lasts for days. I haven't even drained the battery yet because when it gets to 80% after two days, it only takes 20 minutes to charge back!- display interfaces that you can change and personalize- real-time data of heart rate, sleep data - which is accurate to the minute I wake up.- can take pictures and video by tapping my smart watch when phone is on tripod- timer- quiet, vibrating morning alarm clock- can pause or forward music playing on my phone from watchDownsides:- the app did logout of my profile unknowingly so that erased my data overtime (maybe I did something wrong here)",

        "review": "I had a mi band 6 before this. The touch screen stopped responding after 3 years or so. To be fair, I was wearing it while working with spraying water and sludge, and I am hard on my watch. I am constantly banging it into things. I tried a 30 dollar knockoff smartwatch first as a replacement,  but it was too much fuss and irritation. I don't need to dial a phone number on my watch. Really all I was looking for was steps, heart rate,  time, and notifications.  The mi band 9 handles them all well. The screen is crisp and bright, easy to see in the sun or inside. Swiping on the screen works well.  You can select your own shortcuts to swipe left to. Notifications come over very quickly.  I have not noticed any extra battery drain. The vibration is perhaps a little lower than I would prefer, but it is enough to wake me up in the morning,  which I find much less irritating than the alarm on my phone. I would definitely recommend it. The only thing to see is if the new screen holds up as well as the old one, but there are screen protectors if needed.",

        "review": "I'm a fan of the Xiaomi Smart Band. I used the Mi Band 5 and 7, and this time I bought the Mi Band 9. The app isn\u2019t very intuitive, and the user guide for the Mi Band isn\u2019t exactly easy to follow either. However, once I get used to the functions I want to use, the simplicity and lightweight comfort of the Mi Band make it the only one I end up using. The Mi Band 7 and 9 don\u2019t seem to have changed much, but the 7 has been a great help to me over the past two years. The Mi Band 7 didn\u2019t just stop working; it 'died in the line of duty,' having served me faithfully for two years before it passed away.I\u2019ll tell you the story of how I first got introduced to the Mi Band. Back then, it was the Mi Band 5, but since the difference in features is not significant compared to the current Mi Band 9, it remains a useful reference before making a purchase.Company C\u2019s warehouse somewhere in Asia\u2014I worked 8 hours a day pulling a cart non-stop\u2014literally no (official) break time. My job was to find the ordered items, load them up, and deliver them to the ladies who did the packing. The only time I could sit without worrying was during lunch. But being exhausted, full from eating, and sitting down? That\u2019s a perfect recipe for dozing off every time. So, I decided to get myself a reliable alarm clock to keep me awake.I considered a $2 stopwatch from a dollar store (Daiso), but it got eliminated in the final round because changing the battery was a hassle. Instead, I ended up with a much pricier but fancier Mi Band 5. On the first day, I was just happy it told time accurately, but then I realized\u2014it also counted my heartbeats while I was dozing off. Wow, new tech. But, seriously, why? At this point, it might as well have had a feature that automatically alerts a funeral home if my heart stops while I\u2019m sleeping. Anyway, back to work I went.Here are my thoughts after using it for a few days\u2014just personal impressions and some random questions. If you are already reading reviews, you probably know all the functions. So instead of a spec rundown, here\u2019s how I actually use them:Sleep MonitoringIt sends something\u2014electrical signals? Radio waves?\u2014to my wrist at intervals I set (once every minute or every 10 minutes). The fact that only my wrist feels sore in the morning tells me I have clearly been in an inappropriate relationship with this gadget overnight. I don\u2019t even use a microwave, and this doesn\u2019t feel great. But it\u2019s fascinating, so I give it two nights. Then it starts nagging me like my mom did 30 years ago: \"You went to bed too late. Sleep earlier. You didn\u2019t get enough deep sleep.\" It even logs the exact time I get up to use the bathroom. Now, that\u2019s impressive.ExerciseThe only workout I do is running. I don\u2019t have any heart conditions, so I never care about heart rate. But I do like that it tracks my distance. At my age, I need to brag about how far I can still run.Menstrual Cycle Tracking & AlertsI\u2019m a guy.Battery Life & ChargingThe battery lasts forever. Charging is easy. No complaints.Stress MonitoringI already know when I\u2019m stressed. Do I really need a watch to tell me? Also, it doesn\u2019t seem to differentiate between stress, tension, and excitement\u2014like the kind of excitement you get from certain situations, for example.Final ThoughtsIf you are old enough to need reading glasses to see this text, listen up: Mi Band 9\u2019s font is tiny. If you just want the time displayed in big numbers, that\u2019s fine, but cramming multiple bits of info on one screen? Forget it.It is packed with features, but let\u2019s be real\u2014who is actually going to check their sleep data every day for a year? Your sleep quality won\u2019t improve just because you look at the numbers. And honestly, how many buyers really have serious arrhythmia concerns? Unless you do, heart rate tracking isn\u2019t that useful. Also, if your phone is within reach, why would you squint at this tiny screen for texts or fumble with your fat fingers trying to change songs? That\u2019s just comedy.It is basically a cute gadget watch. But!If you\u2019ve read this far, you\u2019re already too invested. Let\u2019s be real\u2014you\u2019ll probably hit that \"Buy Now\" button tonight and go to bed pretending it never happened. Just get this over with, and stop thinking about your next purchase for now. Free yourself from the agony\u2014buy it now, and move on.Objectively, just the watch and step tracker alone make it worth it. It also has a handy feature to help you find your phone. A solid, sleek, and not-too-cheap-looking digital watch for under $45? That\u2019s not easy to find. And if playing around with its features makes you enjoy working out for a month or two, that alone justifies the price. For serious fitness folks, you might even discover more useful functions than I did.And when you get bored? Swap out the band (about $7) or trade it with your nephew for an Attack on Titan figurine, a popular anime character. It has a design that kids totally fall for.Good luck.",

The size is right for me, the display is large and easy to read and there are plenty of watch faces to choose from. I'm not into sports or workouts so it's had light use so far. At just over two weeks it still has over 50 percent charge. I like the sleep tracker and heart rate monitor and the text and phone alerts have been useful. I've used the timer function too and it beats having to pull out my phone and go through the process of setting a timer on it. I swapped out the band it came with after wearing it a few days. I prefer the old-fashioned style that has a buckle and keeper loops to hold the free end. For under $50 I think it would be hard to find one that works this well. Set up was fast and easy, too.",

I get the same, if not more options,  than I did with my previous higher end watches for a fraction of the cost. The battery lasts for days and days. I can track sleep, heart rate, steps, get my text messages and app messages.  I'm still diving into everything it can do. The only drawbacks are it doesn't sync directly with any of my fitness apps but Samsung offers a backdoor way of syncing it's information via the Samsung health app on my phone. Another drawback is that it drains your phone battery much quicker due to the constant connection between the watch and phone. I just turn off the Bluetooth connection when I don't need the notifications from my phone pinged to my watch. However there's still a good bit of drain from the app even after this has been done.

I have an Apple watch but then I don\u2019t want to use it because I\u2019m afraid it will end up being broken at work too (I already broke 2 Fitbit watches due to the nature of my work). And since it\u2019s almost the same size as my fitbit, my husband recommended this brand. I usually don\u2019t wear watch when I\u2019m at home but now even after work, I\u2019m still wearing it. I like how it tracks my sleep hours, steps and calories burned. My apple watch has too much apps that I don\u2019t need, gets low batt easily, and it looks big for my small wrist (I got it as a gift). Xiaomi has the basic apps that I need making it battery efficient. I can go on days without charging it. I only charge it when I drive (30mins most of the time) and that\u2019s enough to have it 100% charged. I love its size compared to my apple watch too. Not too wide. Just right for my wrist size. I sometimes forget that I\u2019m wearing it. The straps are easy to put on with a snap. There\u2019s a decent amount of display themes to choose from. The 2 downsides for me: 1. The brightness doesn\u2019t adjust, so when it\u2019s bedtime and I move my arm\u2026tadaaa bright display coming up. 2. It doesn\u2019t sync every time like my Apple watch. Sometimes I have to manually sync it using the app so my stats will record or the weather gets updated on the watch.

The steps it counts (4000\u2019s) were much less than I actually runs (6000\u2019s). The band is not flexible or soft enough.

        "review": "I bought this to replace my Galaxy Watch 5 (and a pink one to replace my girlfriend's Galaxy Watch 4), because we had to charge our watches every 14 hours or so and they were getting more sluggish by the month. I always like to break electronics down on a simple pros & cons list, so let's have at it (in alphabetical order)._:PROS:_- Battery life is superb. I could definitely see getting 3 weeks out of a charge if I turned off all the extra features. As it stands, I typically get at least 10 days with sleep tracking and AOD (always-on-display) turned on, (both of which the watch warns you will reduce battery life). Charging from ~10% to 100 only takes about 2 hours as well on a normal 1A charger.--- Battery optimization options also are excellent, such as \"smart AOD\" (turns the screen off when the watch detects you're sleeping or when the watch isn't on your wrist at all). They can easily be found in Settings (gear icon)->Battery or Display.- Exercise tracking has become very accurate after only TWO treadmill walks. There is an option at the end of walking or treadmill workouts to calibrate the distance traveled.--- I did not realize this until AFTER my first treadmill walk, so I set my next distance walk to 2.2 mi, which is VERY close to 3.22 km.----- It was over by about 200 meters, so I adjusted it to 3.22 and then my 3rd treadmill walk was within 0.01 km of my actual distance traveled, according to the treadmill, so I was very impressed by that.- Notifications come through quickly from your default apps (messages, phone calls, email) as well as any other app that can send notifications to your phone, like games, security camera apps, etc.--- Although pictures will not be displayed (MMS messages), texts with emojis do work.--- You cannot answer calls from the watch, but you can mute or reject them as caller ID does pop up.--- There is an option in the settings to deactivate notifications while your phone screen is unlocked, which is nice so you're not getting them in two places at once.- Screen and overall user interface is very responsive - I was slightly uneasy about buying a watch with no buttons at all, but the screen feels incredibly reliable.--- Also, there are a TON of different displays to switch to, simple Analog & Digital ones, as well as ones with more information and customizable ones into which you can insert pictures. This all feels great.- Size & Design are very appealing - the screen does not feel too large even for my girlfriend - it is the perfect size.- Sleep tracking with heart rate monitoring & REM tracking also feels pretty accurate. There is also an option to monitor night-time breathing rate, but that consumes more battery so I have not checked that off yet._:CONS:_- Firstly, as it goes with many electronics and apps, it feels like you are signing your life and naming rights of your firstborn child away upon setup, but there is an easy-to-find option in the section \"Profile->About this app\" to \"Revoke Authorization\" if you change your mind on how much data is collected.- Alarm app only allows you to \"snooze\" one time, then the alarm will not go off again until the next day, so you may need to set multiple alarms if you sleep through your first one, like I often do.- I cannot find out how to change the distance units from the default km; you are able to change the weather units from C to F, but I have not yet found the option to toggle km to miles if it exists.- Hiking & Walking programs: I do not believe there is a difference between these at all; this is not so much of a complaint, but on my older GPS-tracking watches, both programs would track your route. In addition, Hiking would also include changes in altitude, which I very much liked. So color me slightly disappointed to find, at the end of my hike, hills had not been accounted for. Again, minor thing overall, but that would have been nice to be included in the workout summary._:NEUTRALS:_- In regards to the app, it is overall easy to use and find things.- One odd thing is that the \"Workout\" section only contains 5 icon at the top (Outdoor running, Walking, Outdoor cycling, Treadmill & Jump Rope), but there are a TON more on the actual watch for other activities (aerobic / weight-training / swimming / etc.), just as a FYI...- (not the company's fault) but aftermarket it definitely lighter for bands than other mainstream smartwatches - I've gotten a couple cool magnetic claps ones around the $10 - $15 mark that are well worth it though.OVERALL, for under a hundred bucks, this definitely feels like the best tracker out there in terms of functionality, battery life, and usefulness. I consider myself pretty critical and my caveats are not even impactful enough to remove a star. Also, my girlfriend still raves about hers as well, so she still loves it and hasn't mentioned any of her own cons to me (and I have asked...).",

        "review": "Battery life is great and the, the face options are fun and plenty, and it feels comfortable on my wrist. My only star removal is due, in part, to the app. It's required to run all the time on the phone and it seems to eat the battery life. The battery lasts a long time, regardless, but that also means it can take a long time to charge back up when you need to. I used to charge my Fitbit watches (plural, thanks for crappy quality) while showering. I can't really do that with this unless I leave it charging after the shower is complete. No big deal, however, as it otherwise remains on my wrist all other times of the day.I was not expecting the app to properly sync with my Trainwell fitness app but, surprisingly, it did. It even had the GPS information and a lot of metrics during the run. I didn't even have to do anything to get Trainwell to see the run, it just sucked it right in like me with donuts!I will point out one annoyance, and I'm not 100% sure this is the watch and not Android, but whenever I have a voicemail waiting for me, any time the phone receives signal, where it didn't have signal before, the watch will buzz and show a notification for the pending voicemail. Between my office and parking spot, if there's a VM I know about it at least 3-times during my walk. I looked for a way to turn off certain apps from sending notifications, but either I got distracted or I couldn't find a way to restrict them. It also wants me to let it connect all the time and run in the background, but their instructions for doing that on Android is outdated or doesn't work with my phone cause it never works and constantly tells me to do the app permissions.For an inexpensive fitness tracker and watch, I think the quality more than exceeds the price!",

Activity tracking is easy, and I haven't had any issues with bumping the tracker and accidentally stopping timers like I did with the Fitbit.  It has all the features I wanted, a few I wasn't looking for but that have been helpful (like being able to switch my phone to do not disturbfrom the tracker), and none of the extra stuff that I didn't want.  I really like how the image on the home screen can be changed, and I was impressed when it bumped yoga to the top of the exercise list after I tracked just one yoga routine. I wish the app could be connected to the fitness app I use, but that's my only complaint.  The app has also been easy to use.  Definitely more than worth the price.",

        "review": "This is the 4th generation of Mi Bands I've had, beginning with Mi Band 5. I didn't really like the size switch (I think they made it bigger in gen 8) - as I really liked the slim band that you hardly knew was there. But, I have to say this band feels awfully sleek. And I don't really notice it that much.The band is really soft - they also appear to have made it a little thicker. As I did break 2 or 3 bands over the years, this is probably a good thing.The auto brightness is an awesome new feature - it was always a pain to adjust the watch for different lighting. Overall the look and feel of the operating system is definitely improved. I assume the heart rate tracking is as stellar as ever - Mi Band has always excelled in that area, and been very close to Apple in terms of accuracy. There's a guy on youtube from Germany or Switzerland who has a great technical comparison of different heart rate trackers, and Xiaomi Mi Bands have always done really well there.Sleep tracking has always been not quite as good - but still a lot better than most. For people like me who just want to know \"hey how many hours did I get last night\" this band will undoubtedly be pretty spot on. Deep diving on your REM, etc - it probably won't rival the top trackers.The biggest problem with the Xiaomi ecosystem has always been how crappy their fitness app has been. I used a 3rd party app for a long time. But the newest incarnation of the Mi Fit app that goes with this watch appears to have finally gotten it right. The app sort of gets out of the way, and gives you what you need pretty quickly. It appears to sync well, and works with things like Strava and Apple Health.I wish I could fine tune the watch OS a little more - and get rid of all the activities I don't do, and just have about 5 or 6. I don't really see a way to do that right now.But overall this watch feels like a pretty decent upgrade from the previous bands, including 8.Highly recommended - probably the best fitness tracker on the planet for the money.",

You can configure your home screen pages to include shortcuts to favorite activities, stats, music controls, timers, etc. There's a wide variety of faces available from minimalist to information overload. Battery life is great, with 5-7 days being standard for me. The factory strap is a bit of a pain to put on, but it uses standard watch straps with quick release pins, so any generic 22mm strap should fit. Heart rate and SpO2 monitoring seem accurate, and it detects activity well. There are a couple things I wish were different. Weight and height are in metric only, so if you're tracking weight loss you'll need to convert each time. The contacts for phone calls don't work. I can see my contacts, but the watch is unable to use them to dial a call. Manual keypad dialing does work though, oddly enough. There is no auto brightness on this model, so it can be a bit bright in dark rooms. It will sync night mode with local sunrise and sunset though, which helps. There are some cool geared/steampunk style mechanical faces available, but they are static. Outside of analog hand movement, there are no animations available. Overall, this offers a lot of functionality and is a solid choice at a great price point.",

        "review": "The Redmi Watch 5 Active is the most hassle-free smart watches I've ever bought. The appearance is simple, and it can be adapted to business or leisure scenes with various straps. The Bluetooth call function is very convenient, and the vibration feedback is gentle and unobtrusive. The battery life is excellent and the charging speed is fast (about 2 hours to fully charge). The downside is that there is less support for third-party apps, but it's perfectly sufficient for users who only need basic smart features. Super cost-effective, recommended for those who pursue pragmatism!",

        "review": "First, this is a great budget-friendly active smart watch. The large LCD display is very nice, and I appreciated the different display options you could use. It's very easy to use and set up. My main reason for getting this watch was for running. I tested this product for a week, and due to my needs, it was not sufficient (aka tracking my run).In regards to running, it took a while to acquire the GPS, and while running, I was consistently notified of a 'low signal'. I have a running partner, and we would compare our data, and it was not the same. The majority of my runs will track the mileage, but it cannot track the location (aka provide the map visual [Strava]) due to the 'low signal'. Also, if you are from the US, this device uses the metric system (e.g., kilometers), and you cannot change it (I tried). Due to this, I returned the device.Overall, I would recommend it for the day-to-day and basic health tracking, but NOT for those who are active and track mileage.",

        "review": "I have had a number of smartwatches including several different Fitbits and I like this the best of all I have tried.  I have been using this watch for several months now.  Most everything about the watch is excellent.  Set up was easy. I gave it only four stars because the sleep tracking seems inaccurate, missing most of the awake time. Also, the auto detection of workouts just takes too long to detect that you are working out.  But, the step counting, GPS, heart rate, SPO2, music control, phone functions all are very good.  I do wish that you could see distance in miles as opposed to kilometers and that you could reply to text messages (you can see the message but not reply).  I love the beautiful large display; the amazing battery life and how quick it charges; and its flawless touch sensitivity and operation.  All in all, I am very happy with this watch.  And yes, the watch band was not very convenient as other owners have reported but you can purchase a variety of different bands that attach very easily on TEMU, AliExpress, or Amazon.  I bought several bands that I love.",

The features are good, it looks awesome, there are tons of watch faces available, it auto detects your workout, the battery life is great, you can customize the cards, you can answer your phone on it, it seems fairly accurate with vitals, I mean for the value, it's pretty awesome!So why only 1 star?1. You can't change units of measurement from metric to imperial units2. It does connect to Google fit, but it's very inconsistent. Every once in a while the heartrate will transfer over, but it'll only transfer a very small data set, and then it won't transfer again for hours or days, even if I try to manually sync.I love all the good features, but this negative ones outweigh everything else. I reached out to the manufacturer about it, literally got zero response. Very disappointing because I have purchased 6 of their phones in the past, and some other devices from them.",
