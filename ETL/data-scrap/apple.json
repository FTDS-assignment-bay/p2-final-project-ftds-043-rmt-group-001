The Series 10 feels noticeably faster, the screen is brighter and sharper, and the battery life has definitely improved. It still has all the features I loved\u2014like staying connected without my phone\u2014but with a smoother, more responsive experience overall.The design is sleek, the new health features are a bonus, and everything just works better. If you\u2019ve been holding on to an older model, this upgrade is totally worth it!",

It\u2019s sleek, fast, and packed with features that make everyday life easier\u2014from tracking workouts and heart rate to answering calls and messages without needing my phone nearby. The cellular feature gives me true freedom when I\u2019m out running or running errands, and the improved battery life easily gets me through the day. The new health and fitness upgrades are incredibly detailed, and the always-on display is sharp and responsive. It\u2019s not just a watch\u2014it\u2019s a powerful tool that keeps me connected, active, and on top of everything. Worth every penny!",

This watch allows him to stay on top of all communication for work and not miss a beat.  Excellent quality that can be dressed up for business or down for work outs.  Love that it is water proof!

        "review": "Upgraded from a series 6 to this series 10. Very glad that I did! The watch itself is much lighter than my previous one, screen is much larger and brighter. I did sacrifice losing out on the blood oxygen level monitor that was included in the series 6 version but that\u2019s not a huge deal for me. The sport watch band with this version is quite thinner than the 6. I was disappointed in that quality but I rarely wear the included rubber sport band. The 10\u2019s battery life lasts longer than the battery life I was getting with the 6 lately. And the 10 charges super quick. So even if I do run the battery down I can quickly recharge it. The auto detection of fitness activity is one of my favs. The series 6 I was using failed to perform that function like it used to. I\u2019ve been careful not to bump the screen of the watch but have once bumped it and didn\u2019t see any scratch or tick in the screen. Seems durable so far. And the best thing of it all if that the expensive, nice watch bands I invested in with my previous watch all fit this version with now issues. That was a concern of mine and would\u2019ve dictated if I returned this version.Like other reviewers, I opened the Amazon delivery box (which was packaged fairly well) and noticed that one loop on the outside of the Apple Watch packaging almost appeared as if it had been previously opened - despite me purchasing a new item. I proceeded forward and noticed that the white thin pull tab stickers on both the watch package and the band package hadn\u2019t been opened. So that was relief. Guess the outside just got shuffled. If you see the pulled tabs on the two inner boxes are still attached, then you know what\u2019s inside will be new.Overall the purchase has been good and I highly recommend the 10.",

        "review": "Awesome upgrade from the SE (2nd Gen) I want to start off with the size. It feels like the body (42mm) is almost the same size as the 40mm AW SE but the screen is bigger due to smaller bezels. The glossy black looks really nice. I haven\u2019t scratched it yet but I\u2019m guessing it will scratch easily. But let\u2019s talk about two upgrades that make it worth it to me.1) Always On Display. The SE (2nd generation) didn\u2019t have it and it\u2019s a huge difference for me. I can see the time and complication data all the time without lifting my wrist. I would also recommend turning off \u201cRaise To Wake\u201d as it\u2019s unnecessary with this feature on. Surprisingly even having the AOD, the battery is pretty good leading into my second favorite part of this watch.2)  Battery. Somehow I\u2019m getting more time out of the battery with the Always On Display than my SE with Raise To Wake. With my old AW, I had to top it off in the morning and at night as it would be at around 20% at the end of the day. So far I\u2019ve been charging this watch to around 90% before I got to bed and still easily getting 24hrs between charges. On top of that it fast charges quickly so basically I stick it on the charger while taking a shower and it\u2019s usually almost fully charged when I get out. I still consider it a 1 day battery so it\u2019s not crazy long if you\u2019re someone who likes to spend days outdoors or whatever. But I just like the fact I don\u2019t have to think too much about the charging. Just throw it on the charger for like 30 minutes and it\u2019s good for a day or so.In short decent screen size, fast charging, battery that lasts at least 24 hrs, and Always On Display.Cons: The battery could still be better. I feel that Apple could focus more on battery and less on making it slimmer than previous watches. I don\u2019t want a bulky watch either but it would be nice to get at least 2-3 days of heavy use between charges. Disappointed that the Blood Oxygen app doesn\u2019t work. I know there\u2019s a lawsuit but it still sucks that the app is downloaded but non functional. If you own a more recent AW this probably isn\u2019t worth it specifically if you already have a modern looking watch with AOD.",

Personally, I love a classic watch. I still love wearing standard watches. This has been a great smartwatch that looked a bit more like the classic watches we all wear. But while it may be a classic-looking watch, it offers many of the great benefits of a smartwatch with access to a variety of apps and notifications. With the amount of cold calls and spam texts I get, it's nice to be able to see if I really need to go get my phone.

But I don't know where else to leave it so I'm sorry. I don't know if it has happened to anyone else but they swapped my watch somewhere in the process, but my package was not tampered with, just the watch box itself and not the shipping brown box. It had some thicker peel to open tape, the white strip one and even the Milanese loop was exchanged with a refurbished one. Amazon has now refunded my money after almost 3 hours of back and forth calling. The first time I called the customer service rep immediately said I will issue a refund and keep the item but all that was refunded was the shipping, 9 days later still no refund. Called again and then denied the whole refund, said the rep did not get authorized to do so; we're sorry but there's nothing to do anymore. This rep had a hard time understanding that they swapped the item and not that I didn't like the item received and when she did, and insisted it was Apple so I needed to contact them. So I escalated to their manager and he said we will honor it and do this ONE TIME courtesy refund, and I said well this does not give me confidence to keep buying large valued amount items from you then. One time, wow. I said I am an honest person and am not trying to scam anyone here but someone somewhere inside is switching items with refurbished or possibly even their own. Could be from Apple,  Well like I said they made it right, but beware. Overall coming from the Watch 3 series it's a yuuuuge upgrade, I love all the new features, way faster and smoother screen animations , I wish I would have received the black at least to review that one but I am growing fond of this color.

Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost. I hope I find more useful  tools over time. Overall, I'm not sorry I got it; I'm just not sure it was worth it.",

Only some very very minor imperfections that are barely noticeable.I was nervous at first because it was very difficult to get the watch to hold a charge. It was barely charging at all the first hour or so, stuck at about 30%. I left it alone and in low power mode for about 2 hours and once it made it to 50%, it updated to the latest version and started gradually charging normally. The battery health is definitely not the best and it could probably be replaced, but it is still very much functional as is.I\u2019ve had it for a few weeks now, and it charges pretty quick, like within an hour to 80%. The charge lasts a long while. I\u2019m a nurse and it can last longer than a 12 hour shift on a full charge. it helps to use Low power mode. I have not had any other issues with it so far.

It could be a keeper for you but unfortunately not for me.Good part:The conditions of the watch itself is pretty good. There is no scratch or damage. Watch functions no problem, everything works pretty good. Plus it is cellular version.Bad part:None of the accessories are original, including band and charger plugs box. Which is actually pretty upset for me since I thought for an excellent condition watch at least some original parts. The charger comes with it has a crack on it and not factory. Which means it can\u2019t fast charge the watch. Also it generates a lot of heat which feels pretty dangerous for me. Also the battery health is only 83% which is a lot worse than I thought.Overall I realized I really don\u2019t need cellular, and without fast charging charger and only 83% battery health. It can barely last a day if want to track your sleep. And you need to spare some time for charging. Considering now you can get a brand new SE2 for the same price.

I have had this apple watch for 3 yrs since 2022, and the apple store genius bar said they could not fix it I would need to buy another apple watch.  I did not want to invest in a new upgraded watch since I have not upgraded my iphone as yet.  I looked here and saw that AMAZON offered refurbished good and RENEWED.  I decided to buy the RENEWED apple watch that stated looks like new and I must say I am SURPRISED that it works and looks new it came packaged well and with a charging cord. It is always a risk buying anything refurbished so I was not expecting much.  I must say I am really happy I decided to go with the renewed refurbished no scratches no dents the band is new that it came with, IPaired it and waited 2 days to write  my review. The key to sabing battery life is to put your watch on low battery it saves the battery I did that with my other apple watch.  The reason why my other apple watch broke was due to me removing the bands every day and dropping the apple watch to many times. Lets see how long this one last. I decided not to change the bands everyday on this one and try not to drop it frequently. This should last until I get an iphone upgrade and watch.  Again I am pleased with this purchase.",

It was pretty dark in my room, so I turn on the lights, take a closer look and it appears that either A) The screen had come off and they had tried to glue it back together with the equivalent of elementary Elmer's glue OR B) The Apple Watch adhesive had been extremely used and worn out- to the point where the adhesive was \"leaking\" over the edges of the screen- something fatal they failed to inspect. I am almost sure it is the former given that the adhesive seems it was applied as the real apple watch adhesive is located inside the lining of the screen rather than on its outside edges.

By the way- the deadline was in late December. I had returned it in the first third of the time they wanted it back. Fast-forward, and I see that they had charged me a \"restocking fee\" of HALF OF PRICE OF THE WATCH.

The cost to actually repair it is much cheaper by the way, and you could probably do a better job. Nowhere do they mention a restocking fee, especialIy not such a large one.

I asked for a full refund in what one would consider polite given the circumstances. Here's the kicker. They had the AUDACITY to claim that I, MYSELF, had broken it because it was not returned immediately after receival. Don't be mistaken, they would likely come up with another excuse to only refund you half of your money even if you returned it earlier than myself. The apple watch was not used a single day after my initial complaint, yet the customer service had the incredible nerve to claim that it was my fault. They somehow believe that I had bought the watch, and planned to break and return it. They genuinely believe that somebody would buy the watch and report damage the day after so that they could use it for a month, THEN break it in the exact way as described, THEN return it. Not even a legitimate scammer would plan that- logically, its just not cost efficient, practical, or useful. The customer service was vague and almost condescending.Just because they have some sort of Amazon Renewed Certification does not mean it will be anywhere close to \"like new\" or excellent folks. You would think that for a company selling the same items tagged in progressively ascending order of quality (They have the same watch at different prices for \"good\" \"Very Good\" and \"Excellent\") would have an at least decent \"Excellent\" option.

I bought this pre-owned Apple Watch in October, and from DAY ONE, the screen started peeling off. NOT EVEN A MONTH IN, and the watch was falling apart before my eyes. This is not normal wear and tear\u2014this is cheap, lazy, bare-minimum refurbishment meant to last JUST long enough to clear the 30-day return window.I reached out to the seller? They told me to go to Amazon. Amazon? No help. I am warning you now: DO NOT EXPECT CUSTOMER SERVICE. This seller is running a quick-cash scam, selling barely-functioning products, and banking on the fact that you won\u2019t notice the defects in time.If you see ANY AIR BUBBLES under your screen, RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY. Don\u2019t convince yourself that it\u2019s nothing\u2014it means your watch is already breaking apart. And don\u2019t expect a refund, because once you\u2019re past that return window, you are stuck with their garbage.I don\u2019t care if they sell this watch for HALF PRICE\u2014it\u2019s NOT WORTH IT. Whether it\u2019s for you, a loved one, young or old, this will ONLY cause frustration and disappointment. Your money is TOO HARD-EARNED to waste on a scam.From now on, I\u2019M ONLY BUYING FROM APPLE DIRECTLY.

Saw these renewed ones for a fraction of the price. I ordered one and 2 days later, it showed up. It was in a plain box and had a charger with it. Good thing because it was dead as I\u2019ve ever seen anything dead. It charged up in an hour or so I could get it set up.I inspected it. There are wear marks on the case and crown but the face was fine. I put a screen and case protector on it and it looks fine.I checked the battery life and it\u2019s down to 85%. I\u2019m sure that\u2019s going to be fine. I know it can be replaced it I want to later.The sports band is not an Apple product but I don\u2019t care. I quit buying Apple Watch bands years ago. I can buy 3 or 4 of these perfectly fine knockoffs for the price of one Apple.Other than the scuffs and battery it works as it should.Down with overpriced stuff and thumbs up for cheaper rebuilt semi quality stuff. Kinda like a rebuilt transmission.*****UPDATE*****As for the functionality of the watch, it's fine except for the battery life.  I have to charge it part way through the day IF I want it to last all day.  On more than one occasion, by 4:00 pm, I got the 10% battery left message and then it is dead until I get it on a charger.  Now, I'm going to have to spend $100 to get the battery replaced.AND - the watch charger that came with it, does not work.  Yes, I took the piece of plastic off of it before trying it out.  I'm beginning to regret my purchase.I guess I could see if I can replace the battery myself but I don't want to perform surgery on a piece of electronics at my age.  The battery will be around $25 and the tool kit will be around $30 plus shipping and handling.  Still saving money though.  Maybe I can start a side hustle replacing apple watch batteries and save enough to go on vacation in the tropics or buy a small can of pineapple juice.Buyers remorse is setting in. REMOVE A STAR!*****UPDATE #2*****Found a video tutorial that walked me through turning off a number of the functions of the watch to save on battery.  I am pleased to report that after doing that, I can now wear it 10 or 11 hours and the watch will still have mid 70's battery left.  I shouldn't have to do this but I did so Now I can wear it and not worry about taking a charger to work with me so I can charge it over my lunch break.",

Mine was 88 .Accessories original equipment manufacturer. Mine didn\u2019t have the high speed charger in the product description, rather a cheap basic watch charger and cheap silicon band. The band I can understand.There was no oxygen sensor as described in watch description. The compass feature/function was broken. This was not the\u201d premium\u201d product that I paid extra for.Also heads up they way over charge for sales tax. And do not refund the difference of what it really is and the much bigger amount that you will get charged.This is my first experience with Amazon Renewed.

Premium being the best and most expensive.Premium Condition is defined as NO signs of cosmetic damage ie scratches, dents, etc.. mine had a very noticeable gouge in the top of the case, see pic.Battery should be 90% or greater of original battery life. Mine was 88 .Accessories original equipment manufacturer. Mine didn\u2019t have the high speed charger in the product description, rather a cheap basic watch charger and cheap silicon band. The band I can understand.There was no oxygen sensor as described in watch description. The compass feature/function was broken. This was not the\u201d premium\u201d product that I paid extra for.Also heads up they way over charge for sales tax. And do not refund the difference of what it really is and the much bigger amount that you will get charged.This is my first experience with Amazon Renewed. Read copious reviews some people had a good experience but appear to be the minority. If amazon can make this right somehow I will update this review or take it down.Good luck all!!",

My son bought one of these new when they first came out and paid double what I paid.My cons list is short: (and really not the seller but the watch itself)I didn\u2019t realize if you have a tattoo where the sensor sits it will not read correctly.  I thought something was wrong with my watch but did a little research and found it was the tattoos on my wrist\u2026I verified this by moving the watch to an area with then without and watching the watch shut off.  I now choke the watch up a little closer to my hand (which can be annoying sometimes when working out) and it works perfectly.  Also\u2026I think sunscreen might affect the sensor as well.  I had sunscreen on and the watch was doing a similar thing that it did with the tattoo.  I wiped the sensor and my wrist off and it started working fine.Lastly I do wish the watch came with a little better charger\u2026the one they sent me works just fine but it\u2019s slow as can be.  The charger my son has charges our watched in 1.5-2 hours.Overall\u2026everything I\u2019ve said below is just as (if not more) relevant.  I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to buy this watch again.

I wanted this to track my 5 day a week gym workouts, sleep, and heart rate with running, meditation, and cold plunging.I honestly only have 1 con at this point.  The watch came with a sticker right on the health tracker and the glue was annoying (really not hard just annoying) to have to remove.The pros are many: the watch came with %100 battery health witch I was surprised about.  I\u2019ve been using it and I\u2019ve only had to charge it every 1.5 days.  It also looks great.  No visible issues, problems, blemishes at all.

I thought about possibly getting it replaced/repaired, but what I would pay wouldn't be worth it for me to take it in somewhere to possibly get it replaced, given how much I paid for it initially. Also, I noticed there were scratches on the crown and the sides. While I knew it wouldn't look perfectly brand new, I wonder how 'refurbished' can mean poorly done. I am very disappointed.",

The only complaint is the watch band did not work but I got my own at Marshall\u2019s for 2 bucks so another big money saver. I only spent 190 on this versus the new ones at 349.I might upgrade in a couple years but this serves my purposes for now (fitness and health) very happy with this purchase this buyer and surprised honestlyAlso this order came a day early so there\u2019s that.The battery life kinda sucks compared to Fitbit but I kind of expected that.Update 2024.

I wish my husband would step into the 21st century. But he won\u2019t. Not the fault of the company that refurbished this watch. Wonder if they sell upgrades for old husband brains\u2026.",

Every time I would wear it with it fully being charged, it would drain so quickly and heat up on my wrist. I came to find out that the battery was needing service and it was not operating above 75%. I thought about possibly getting it replaced/repaired, but what I would pay wouldn't be worth it for me to take it in somewhere to possibly get it replaced, given how much I paid for it initially. Also, I noticed there were scratches on the crown and the sides. While I knew it wouldn't look perfectly brand new, I wonder how 'refurbished' can mean poorly done. I am very disappointed.",

Fitbit has totally changed everything and made it worse so I\u2019m glad I switched to this watch. Works perfectly. The only complaint is the watch band did not work but I got my own at Marshall\u2019s for 2 bucks so another big money saver. I only spent 190 on this versus the new ones at 349.I might upgrade in a couple years but this serves my purposes for now (fitness and health) very happy with this purchase this buyer and surprised honestlyAlso this order came a day early so there\u2019s that.The battery life kinda sucks compared to Fitbit but I kind of expected that.Update 2024. Great watch, still works amazingly and I\u2019m planning to buy a new MacBook Pro from Amazon renewed. So happy was able to save money and the product works like new and looks brand new.

        "review": "It came in a plain box. I have never owned much less seen an Apple Watch before but it was way past time for a new watch. Since I\u2019ve owned an iPhone for a few years now I thought I\u2019d take the dive and buy one. It isn\u2019t the latest on the market but how would I know that? I got it because of the health benefits. It can even map my steps like when I walk my dog. That\u2019s something my fitbit never did. I can change the watch face to anything in the watch library.It was super easy to pair with my phone. I started charging it as soon as I got the watch band put on. I even got a watch face protector and put that on before I got it set up to charge.It says it\u2019s supposed to take 2.5 hours to charge to full but I think because I ended up updating and syncing and pairing it with my iPhone it didn\u2019t charge full in that time. So I was impatient and started wearing it at 58% charged. I read you\u2019re not supposed to let it drain down to zero or it could ruin your battery. Also that it\u2019s ok to charge over night because there is a shutoff when it is full. Same with an iPhone which I did not know. Learn something new everyday right?The other thing I learned is I don\u2019t need to add it to my phone like add another line and pay $10 extra just so I can answer my phone with my watch and leave my phone at home. Since I retired I don\u2019t use my phone enough to warrant that service.I like that I can add my meds I take and set an alarm for them. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that I like about the fitness and health aspect of it.I\u2019m still learning about it and there\u2019s so much to learn. The easiest thing was pairing it with my phone because once it was charged enough to turn on it did and my phone was sitting nearby and it flashed a screen quickly all I seen was click pair phone and the screen changed because I was downloading watch faces. I like that there is an instruction manual linked so if you have questions you can click on the manual link and open the booklet. It\u2019s really small print so you have to pinch the screen to enlarge it big enough to read on your phone.It reads in the manual that the battery drains faster when you have more apps on it working and open. Like : notify for text messages; automatic downloads, those kinds of things and you can turn them off so it doesn\u2019t drain your battery as fast.It\u2019s supposed to last 18 hours from a full charge but that depends on usage. Like do you FaceTime often, use it for phone calls instead of phone, listening to music/podcasts? Because if so that cuts down on the 18hr charge time.I read that these watches can last up to 5-6 years before they don\u2019t work no more and that\u2019s if you take care of it properly. Batteries can be replaced. Bands are interchangeable. I recommend getting a screen protector for the watch face. It\u2019s easy to snap on.I think because I bought excellent condition refurbished which is kinda like brand new at least I think it is, that I won\u2019t have the problems I see other people having like only working for a few months or not charging after a week. That charger is small and I am not sure exactly where to set it. The screen goes black after a few seconds so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s charging. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s a way to see from my phone but like I said I just got it today and just barely finished setting it up as best I could with everything I think I can.So far I\u2019m loving the watch! I\u2019m a former android user slowly over the past 10 years I been moving over to Apple products. This watch being my latest piece to my collection.My best advice when shopping refurbished is are you really going to buy an acceptable item because it\u2019s even cheaper than the good, or excellent? And then come complain because it arrived with scratches or something. You get what you pay for I was always told. So read the description before you add to cart, make sure you know exactly what you\u2019re paying for.",

        "review": "It was time to buy an Apple Watch.  The Ultra seemed to have all the features and *in my mind* the smaller \"regular\" models were a compromise of sorts.  But the new Ultra II watches are VERY expensive.  Not in my budget and in my mind not a good value.  But I think I found the value I needed.I researched Ultra I vs Ultra II (and the Series 10) watches and decided that while the Ultra II has more features and a \"faster processor\", these weren't things that I *needed*.  It came with features that are not automtically included with the Series 10 watches such as titanium frame. An extra control button, and a few minor other things.It appeared that the \"renewed\" watches seemed to have a good track record and one came along with a band that I liked and I jumped on it.I like this watch.  Big learning curve, but I'm settling in.  The unit I received seems to be in perfect condition, with a plastic protector over the face. No scratches or any marks that I can see. The one thing that surprised me, but just a little, is that it came in a crappy generic box. Nothing like how Apple packages their products. But I won't be wearing the box, so who cares.  It also came with a little charging disk/cord that looks like an EKG sensor.  The charging thing works, but I bought an inexpensive night stand charger which I like.One of the ingenious things about the Apple Watch is their approach to watch bands.  I like the one that came with it, but to change a band is easy and takes only seconds.  I ordered 3 more bands, but just sent back on.  So many to choose from. The bands change the whole character of the watch, and I can set matching watch faces.  So much fun to be able to take one watch and inexpensively give it so many looks.I reserve 5 star rating for only outstanding products.  I give this 4.5 stars, because the cheap packaging ruined the overall gestalt of receiving a watch that costs this much money.",

After some deliberation, I chose the AWU, and I\u2019m glad I did.The watch arrived in pristine condition\u2014no scratches, dents, or signs of prior use. The battery health was at 91%, which is virtually new. It came with the Ocean Band, which was brand new and adds to the premium feel of the watch. While the included 1m Magnetic Charging Cable didn\u2019t seem to be an original Apple product, it wasn\u2019t a deal-breaker for me.Setting up the watch was a breeze. Adding it to my US Mobile account was straightforward, and as a Premium customer, there\u2019s no extra charge for Apple Watch connectivity\u2014a fantastic perk! The watch performed flawlessly when making calls, sending texts, and streaming music. Everything worked as advertised, and the experience has been seamless so far.Overall, I\u2019m thrilled with my decision. The Apple Watch Ultra offers premium features and durability at an excellent value. For anyone considering a refurbished model, I\u2019d say go for it\u2014I would definitely buy it again!",

However, when they actually got into the box, they were overjoyed.We have owned the watch for a little over 4 months now and it charges every evening and functions to full capacity.  The battery life easily lasts all day and it's on a mix of cellular and wifi with no issues.The screen is scratch free and the touch functionally works well. We had no issues hooking up the cellular aspect and pairing the watch.In addition to the nondescript packaging, the watch came with an aftermarket black band with two length options, and a charger.  The aftermarket band came apart in just a couple of weeks but we were able to purchase a better replacement, but keep that in mind when purchasing.Overall we are pleased with the quality of the watch, including its like new appearance, for the value.",

Apps open quickly, animations are super smooth, and Siri works faster than ever\u2014even handling some requests without needing your iPhone nearby.The display is bright and crystal-clear, even in direct sunlight, and the always-on feature is incredibly useful. I also love the Double Tap gesture\u2014it makes answering calls or pausing music feel effortless when your hands are full. Health and fitness tracking is as detailed and accurate as you'd expect, with new features like better sleep tracking and cycle insights.Battery life is solid and easily gets me through a full day, even with heavy use. Plus, it pairs seamlessly with my iPhone and other Apple devices, making it a great addition to the Apple ecosystem.If you're upgrading from an older model or buying your first Apple Watch, the Series 9 is a smart, stylish, and powerful choice that delivers on performance and convenience.",

Both with the functionality and the user interface. I used it as I was training for a marathon. It monitored all my health metrics and alerted when I was in need of a rest day. The fit was great, and I chose to protect the touch screen with a cover. It limits the functionality slightly. But the benefits greatly outweigh the drawbacks.

        "review": "Physical condition was totally fine in appearance, no scratches or anything. But things you should know:1. The battery health shows max charge of 83%, which is not great. According to the Amazon Renewed info page, this falls short of the \"Premium\" and \"Excellent\" condition, placing it in the \"Good\" category if we only look at battery health metric.2. The charging cable it came with is terrible, super cheap and takes ages to charge. It may be \"good enough\" to do in a pinch, but expecting to spend an additional $30 or so for a proper one (especially considering the limited battery capacity).3. The ECG works on only about 1/10 attempts. The rest of the time it glitches out. Idk whether this issue is on Apple's end with an unreliable app, or whether the hardware supporting this feature is degraded on the device itself. I suspect the internals to measure this are fragile and susceptible to damage from drops.4. Verizon customers, beware: I have been unable to connect cellular service (see image). Unclear whether this is an issue on Verizon's end, or if the \"Renewing\" process didn't also clear up associations with the device's IMEI number (i.e. it's already been bound to another carrier or something). I have an iPhone SE (3rd gen), which, according to both Apple and Verizon, should be fully compatible.Considering: Is it worth the hassle of returning this one and ordering another? How likely is it that the next one will be any better?",

I wish my husband would step into the 21st century. But he won\u2019t. Not the fault of the company that refurbished this watch. Wonder if they sell upgrades for old husband brains\u2026.",

Every time I would wear it with it fully being charged, it would drain so quickly and heat up on my wrist. I came to find out that the battery was needing service and it was not operating above 75%. I thought about possibly getting it replaced/repaired, but what I would pay wouldn't be worth it for me to take it in somewhere to possibly get it replaced, given how much I paid for it initially. Also, I noticed there were scratches on the crown and the sides. While I knew it wouldn't look perfectly brand new, I wonder how 'refurbished' can mean poorly done. I am very disappointed.",

Fitbit has totally changed everything and made it worse so I\u2019m glad I switched to this watch. Works perfectly. The only complaint is the watch band did not work but I got my own at Marshall\u2019s for 2 bucks so another big money saver. I only spent 190 on this versus the new ones at 349.I might upgrade in a couple years but this serves my purposes for now (fitness and health) very happy with this purchase this buyer and surprised honestlyAlso this order came a day early so there\u2019s that.The battery life kinda sucks compared to Fitbit but I kind of expected that.Update 2024. Great watch, still works amazingly and I\u2019m planning to buy a new MacBook Pro from Amazon renewed. So happy was able to save money and the product works like new and looks brand new. Thank you Amazon and the seller is excellent. :)",

I needed to upgrade to Watch OS 10.3 but that went very quickly.  Pairing with iPhone wasn\u2019t a problem either.  Battery health measured 99%.  The ONLY issue that I had was with the enclosed wireless watch charger that came with the watch.  This charger was NOT an Apple or certified Apple charger.  This was an unmarked, no company name or logo 3rd party unit from Asia.  This charger would literally \u201ccook\u201d the watch when in use.  Thanks to Apple for installing a thermal shutdown in the watch otherwise I would of had a lithium battery fire on my kitchen counter.  The watch would shutdown the charging process but still was very \u201chot\u201d to the touch.  Some of these wireless battery chargers are ONLY rated for 5W using USB-C.  Good luck finding a 5W power unit.  I had one from an old Apple 6 phone that I was able to use and purchased a USB-A male to USB-C female adaptor to use as a watch charger unit.  DO NOT USE THE STANDARD 20W OR LARGER POWER UNITS.  Thermal shutdown will happen during charging.  Please don\u2019t leave the watch unattended while using these non-standard, un-certified wireless chargers.Overall I am very happy with the purchase with pricing point that I paid.  I didn\u2019t need the extra adventure of the wireless charging unit.  Too much drama to an otherwise great transaction.",

The back of the watch had a QC sticker on it.  Weeks later I am still trying to get the adhesive residue off the watch, which is really annoying.

        "review": "The Series 8 Apple Watch works flawlessly.  No problems with the watch.  Outside case and watch crystal had no scratches and looked like new.  I needed to upgrade to Watch OS 10.3 but that went very quickly.  Pairing with iPhone wasn\u2019t a problem either.  Battery health measured 99%.  The ONLY issue that I had was with the enclosed wireless watch charger that came with the watch.  This charger was NOT an Apple or certified Apple charger.  This was an unmarked, no company name or logo 3rd party unit from Asia.  This charger would literally \u201ccook\u201d the watch when in use.  Thanks to Apple for installing a thermal shutdown in the watch otherwise I would of had a lithium battery fire on my kitchen counter.  The watch would shutdown the charging process but still was very \u201chot\u201d to the touch.  Some of these wireless battery chargers are ONLY rated for 5W using USB-C.  Good luck finding a 5W power unit.  I had one from an old Apple 6 phone that I was able to use and purchased a USB-A male to USB-C female adaptor to use as a watch charger unit.  DO NOT USE THE STANDARD 20W OR LARGER POWER UNITS.  Thermal shutdown will happen during charging.  Please don\u2019t leave the watch unattended while using these non-standard, un-certified wireless chargers.Overall I am very happy with the purchase with pricing point that I paid.  I didn\u2019t need the extra adventure of the wireless charging unit.  Too much drama to an otherwise great transaction.",

Everyone knows the specs and performance so I'm writing this review to point out that if you buy a renewed Apple Watch it doesn't come in the original box, but in a few plastic bags inside a non-descript box.  The back of the watch had a QC sticker on it.  Weeks later I am still trying to get the adhesive residue off the watch, which is really annoying.  Works as intended otherwise, but that seems like an easily avoidable inconvenience.",

I requested a replacement, hoping for better, but the second unit arrived in even worse cosmetic condition, with a battery health of just 87%.If a product is labeled \u201cExcellent,\u201d I expect minimal signs of use and a battery health that reflects that\u2014typically 95% or higher. In both cases, the watches clearly showed signs of prior use, and the battery performance did not meet the standard implied by the description.I think it\u2019s only fair to buyers that the condition rating be more transparent and accurate. As it stands, this was disappointing and did not match the expectations set by the listing.",

When my wife got one for health reasons, I saw how useful the watch was and how many ways I could use it.I started looking on Amazon, found the refurbished watches on Woot (Amazon) , found a good price on an Ultra 2 gps+cellular and ordered one. I really love this watch. I love the bigger face, longer battery life and extra features. As stated in the description, the watch was in excellent condition.After it arrived, I wore it a couple of days to make sure it was what I wanted and that it felt good on my wrist. I liked wearing the watch. I ordered a watch face protector because of my bad luck of banging my watches into every hard object I get near. The protector fits great and isn't noticeable on the watch. I also ordered a heavier duty watch band so I wouldn't lose it  during hikes and bike rides.I use it for monitoring my health and tracking my sleep and exercise routine. It is easy to start and finish any type of exercise you know of and many you don't. Knowing how much exercise I'm actually doing during the day keeps me from sitting in the chair too long. It also makes it fun competing against myself.I put the watch on my cellular service and it works well. I enjoy having access to my phone and many apps without bringing my iPhone.Based on my experience, I definitely recommend the refurb watch. No problems and it came in an excellent, like new condition. I also recommend the Ultra 2 for watch face size, longer battery and low power mode, brighter screen, waterproof depth and ruggedness.",

        "review": "I was initially hesitant about purchasing a renewed version of the Apple Watch Ultra 2. I wasn\u2019t sure if the \u201cexpertly refurbished\u201d label would live up to the standards I expect from Apple products. However, after using it extensively for a week, I\u2019m glad to say that my concerns subsided. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve liked so far, along with a few areas where there\u2019s room for improvement.Likes:Impressive Performance: Despite being a renewed product, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 performs flawlessly. It's fast, responsive, and handles multitasking like a champ. Whether I\u2019m switching between apps, tracking a workout, or using it for notifications, it\u2019s smooth sailing.Fitness Tracking: This watchOS has completely changed how I track my fitness. The precision of the heart rate monitor, GPS, and various workout modes ensures I\u2019m getting accurate data, which has helped me optimize my training.Health Features: The health tracking features are top-notch. The ECG, and sleep tracking are incredibly insightful, helping me stay on top of my health metrics.Battery Life: I\u2019m pleasantly surprised by the battery life. It easily lasts a couple of days of heavy use, and with lighter use, I can stretch it to almost 2-3 days before needing a charge. Had the Apple Watch series 7 before and it barely lasted a full day.Seamless Integration with Other Devices: As someone who uses multiple Apple products, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 integrates seamlessly with my iPhone, AirPods, and MacBook.Dislikes:Renewed Product Hesitancy: While the renewed version has performed well, there\u2019s still a bit of anxiety in the back of my mind about long-term durability. However, the watch came in excellent condition with no visible wear and tear, so I\u2019m cautiously optimistic.Screen Responsiveness: One major drawback I\u2019ve noticed is that the screen becomes less responsive when my fingers are sweaty during running. This can be frustrating when trying to interact with the watch during a run. I hope this is something that can be improved with software updates, but it\u2019s a noticeable inconvenience.Battery Life: Both a like and a dislike: While the Apple Watch Ultra 2 has more battery life than my recent Apple Watch, it pales in comparison to competitors like Garmin, which can last up to two weeks on a single charge.Overall: I\u2019m incredibly satisfied with my purchase. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (Renewed) has exceeded my expectations, and I\u2019m confident it will continue to serve me well in my fitness, health, and everyday tech needs. If you\u2019re on the fence about a renewed product, this one is definitely worth considering.",

Listed as great shape, it had no blemishes and is working well. Love the bigger design and the \u201calways on\u201d option so I don\u2019t have to wake it up.  Battery is a mystery however. Some days it lasts forever and others seem to drain quicker. I can\u2019t see a reason for it to last longer or shorter. The days seem comparable in my movement and usage. Coming from a series 7 to an ultra two feels quite different. Much larger, much larger battery, a few additional features but same overall quality.For a few hundred dollars less the renewed option was a good choice.",

        "review": "So, I decided to get an Apple Watch after my Garmin broke in a restaurant over the holidays. Not to get into it, but their support was horrible and I decided to jump ship.Purchased an 8SE in January and it was great\u2014 but I didn\u2019t realize that the SE doesn\u2019t have a keyboard for typing.Returned and purchased this series 7 cellular later in January for about $20-$30 more than the SE was.  It was a certified refurbished purchase and, while it was not eligible for Apple care, it was sold with a comparable 2 year warranty with Amazon.  I was a bit nervous, but it came in perfect condition with a perfect battery.I do have to charge every day, or every 2 days if I remember to turn on low power and other energy-saving modes at night.  I don\u2019t wear in bed.About 10 months in I\u2019m at 94% battery capacity from 100% when I got it.  Do I wish it stayed charged longer?  Sure!  I have to remember to charge it if it\u2019s low and I\u2019m planning on working out, but you just get used to it.Glad I purchased cellular because, even though I didn\u2019t connect it for months, it gave me the option.  I hope to keep the watch long term.Glad I took the chance with return because I\u2019ve had no issues!Series 7 is fantastic and has everything I need (fitness tracking with metrics, general productivity, texts/replies on my watch), and it looks way better than the Garmin as a general watch.  Very easy to swap bands for different occasions or outfits, and there are many options available out there.  I like that I can go from leather band to fabric/silicone easily if I\u2019m getting to work out after work.(As an aside, silver hardware is the better choice generally for Starlight over gold or rose gold if you\u2019d like to match reasonably well)I like to run, do general functional strength training and yoga, and I\u2019ve been happy with Apple for these things.  Plus, it connects to the elliptical at the gym, and runs simultaneous timers when cooking!I recommend both the watch (over my old forerunner 635 and the AW8 SE) and Amazon refurbished.",

It has features that I will never use, but still can\u2019t believe that a finally got myself this Apple Watch series 7 and because my wrist is small I got the 41 MM\u2019. It comes packaged in the nice box. It has one extra ban but as all the watches no directions but when paired with your phone, which mine is the iPhone, google has every answer that you might want to receive to tell you exactly how to use your watch,  how to look up things on your watch, and just about everything. I did take it to the AT&T store where they paired it with my cell phone showed me a little bit of how to do it, and I wore it out of the store to a lovely dinner where the waiter noticed in complemented me on as nice watch. I have it on now. It does have a keyboard and it also has surgery that you can dictate to Siri and she can type it out and then send it. I just can\u2019t say enough about this lovely watch. Won\u2019t use all the features but at least I have the watch and ordered the smaller face as I said 41mm. The larger face is the most popular, but my wrist as well so the smaller watch face looks great on my watch arm. I suggest if you were on an Apple Watch don\u2019t wait because you never know what something might happen to you and you would never be able to enjoy such a nice piece of high-tech. Whether I want to use all the features or not which or fitness probably heart weight rate and a bunch more but I\u2019m still learning and after having it for just a few days over a week I find that it holds a charge nicely but I have charged it. You will need an adapter to plug in your wire to the adapter to electric outlet. It charges very quickly and once more it is just beautiful and I absolutely love the watch. Younger people know how to operate all these high tech things want us older people doesn\u2019t, but it doesn\u2019t matter. I love it. I think he will love it and there is nothing wrong with this watch. It is absolutely perfect and it is absolutely beautiful and the star light color and a plus is the two bands. The guy in the store changed one side of the band, but it proved that it didn\u2019t work exactly fit right and we tried to change the band and couldn\u2019t so we looked up on Google how to change the Apple Watch band and there it was on the back of the watch. There was a little button that you push and part of the watch band will just slide down as you slide it then you put the other half of the watch band on that bitch your arm, the best it is easy to put on and I promise you will love this watch .",

        "review": "Received it on time. Can be a pain to change straps. Pulse Oximeter is unavailable despite being listed as a feature due to some legal case challenging Apples inclusion of the feature.My device came with less than 90% battery health, which is concerning to say the least. Probably won\u2019t buy from the seller I purchased it from again.Other than these issues it seems to work fairly well so far. I love being able to text from my wrist instead of having to dig out my phone every time. Kinda wish it had more apps but kinda glad it doesn\u2019t since the whole point for me is to lowkey disconnect from my phone/socials.UPDATE:The watch is fine BUT the charger that was included in the order spontaneously self destructed seemingly through overheating randomly four months after I got the watch. It was electrically hot and could have very nearly shocked me on household current when this happened. It was not making contact with anything except a (non conductive) wooden surface at the time this happened.This not only means I\u2019ll have to buy a new charger but it also could have set a fire or sent me to the hospital for electrocution so I\u2019m deducting further stars and the chargers from the reseller should be recalled.",

        "review": "So, I was ready to get my first Apple watch but had a couple of concerns. First, is that I while I wanted a recent model, I didn't want to spend more than two or three hundred bucks. Second, is that many people mention how easy the regular glass scratches. Third, is that the frosted-metal finish on the standard aluminum case is everywhere and no matter what band you get, they stand out as a smartwatch. Nothing wrong with that, just an aesthetic preference.Ok, so the option offered by Apple is to get a watch with one of the higher grade case materials (stainless steel, titanium, ceramic) which they pair with a sapphire crystal front glass. This takes care of both issues. The stainless steel case, when paired with certain bands, totally passes as a regular watch, and the sapphire crystal is far more difficult to scratch (although they are more brittle, so easier to shatter when dropped).The problem is that the upgraded cases cost way more than the aluminum. That's where buying this watch here really shines. It's just one step down from the latest model, has the stainless steel case with sapphire crystal... all for less than half of what a new one would cost with the upgraded case/crystal. Being refurbished I was fully expecting it to have scratches here and there, but would not have minded unless they were on the glass or if the buttons had any issues, or if the battery were too worn. Well, I'm thrilled to say that the watch I received is just about flawless! No scratches I can see, and the battery health is at 90%.  It does come with an aftermarket band and aftermarket charger, but this is to be expected with refurbs, and both were functional and new. A new leather band cost me about ten bucks (notice in the attached picture how the stainless case helps it pass more as a regular watch with the leather band) and a genuine Apple charger was 20 something, and charges the watch a good bit faster than the included one, so I'll just keep the included one in the car for backup. My plan is to mimic the strategy I use on my phones, which is to not let the battery get below 20% and only charge up to about 80% or so. This extends battery health immensely, compared to letting it get too low or always charging to 100%. All in all, I am very happy with this purchase, and wholeheartedly recommend buying one of these refurbs.",

Does it honestly really matter... now that's a personal preference.Prior to purchasing, I thought about my previous stainless steel watches (mechanical).  Very quickly after I got each one, they all got scratches in various locations over time.  So even if I were to plunk down the cash for a new Apple stainless one, it was going to get scratched eventually.  Expectations tempered.Also prior to purchasing, I came up with non-negotiables.  Mainly, if the front crystal was scratched, the back sensors had any scratches, the crown was messed up in any way (difficult to turn, cracked, etc), or if the battery felt it wasn't holding a charge.  It was going to go back if any of those were true.When they dipped to a reasonable price, I bought one.  The one I got (sold by CameraGuyz), has some scratches for sure, mainly on the speaker side of the case, as you can see in the photos, as well as various other places on the case (I did get some stainless polish/repair.  I tried barkeepers friend first, which did help a bit, and between the two, really livened it up).  Battery was good (91%), and the front and back and crown/button were pristine.  Lastly, I called my cell provider and verified that the watch could be hooked up to my plan (had them verify the IMEI wasn't blocked or locked).  Check, check, check!Two weeks in, and still going strong.  I love the look of the stainless, and again, for the money paid, truly an incredible deal.  Highly recommend buying this way.  Save yourself the money, and get it used.  And have some stainless steel polish ready!",

A new leather band cost me about ten bucks (notice in the attached picture how the stainless case helps it pass more as a regular watch with the leather band) and a genuine Apple charger was 20 something, and charges the watch a good bit faster than the included one, so I'll just keep the included one in the car for backup. My plan is to mimic the strategy I use on my phones, which is to not let the battery get below 20% and only charge up to about 80% or so. This extends battery health immensely, compared to letting it get too low or always charging to 100%. All in all, I am very happy with this purchase, and wholeheartedly recommend buying one of these refurbs.",

While the watch looked good it was defective since it was verified by a diagnostics test within days of receiving the watch that it has battery and connectivity issues. Reported this immediately. For the return I was told that UPS would have to pick it up from house and an adult must sign for the return- fine, but I could not be given a window of time for the pickup. So ANYTIME that day. And I cannot take it to the UPS store a mile away. Not my fault I was sold a defective watch and the return process is ridiculous.",

        "review": "For the cost savings, I got the perfect watch.  Is it free from scratches: no.  Can you see the scratches with your arm held out: yes.  Does it honestly really matter... now that's a personal preference.Prior to purchasing, I thought about my previous stainless steel watches (mechanical).  Very quickly after I got each one, they all got scratches in various locations over time.  So even if I were to plunk down the cash for a new Apple stainless one, it was going to get scratched eventually.  Expectations tempered.Also prior to purchasing, I came up with non-negotiables.  Mainly, if the front crystal was scratched, the back sensors had any scratches, the crown was messed up in any way (difficult to turn, cracked, etc), or if the battery felt it wasn't holding a charge.  It was going to go back if any of those were true.When they dipped to a reasonable price, I bought one.  The one I got (sold by CameraGuyz), has some scratches for sure, mainly on the speaker side of the case, as you can see in the photos, as well as various other places on the case (I did get some stainless polish/repair.  I tried barkeepers friend first, which did help a bit, and between the two, really livened it up).  Battery was good (91%), and the front and back and crown/button were pristine.  Lastly, I called my cell provider and verified that the watch could be hooked up to my plan (had them verify the IMEI wasn't blocked or locked).  Check, check, check!Two weeks in, and still going strong.  I love the look of the stainless, and again, for the money paid, truly an incredible deal.  Highly recommend buying this way.  Save yourself the money, and get it used.  And have some stainless steel polish ready!",

There are several sellers under this listing, my order was fulfilled by Woot & shipped by Prime, for reference. At startup, it had 95% battery remaining, and no visible specs or scratches to either the case or crystal. All prior data/user information was wiped & the device was unlocked. The watch surface was completely clean, even free of fingerprints! Keeping in mind that even though stainless models have a more resilient surface and scratch resistance together with a premium sapphire crystal, it could have shown some signs of wear, but didn't! Also enclosed was a startup pamphlet and USB-A charging pad.Sadly, the Pulse Ox function isn't working though it might have, because the watch was delivered with watchOS v11. That\u2019s to be expected with the copyright case still in litigation. I noticed another reviewer said their watch's Pulse Ox works, but it might depend on OS version or region since the lawsuit involves US models. After the initial deep charge, battery capacity dropped 1%, which is what I'll consider as its starting point.I can say with honesty it looks amazing, and as far as durability, it should be a winner given its now 94% battery capacity. I expected some minor cosmetic flaws, and other than the average plastic band and underwhelming generic charging pad, I\u2019m thrilled by it arriving is such pristine condition. I am going to purchase an Asurion plan of coverage.How I charged it & ease of operation:In saying all of that, it required several online searches to get accurate information beyond the included startup guide and Apple's instructions to learn how to setup the watch. Yes, it was tedious and nerve-racking. No fault of Apple's, their documentation is complete, but bringing a fully drained battery up to operation is beyond the User Manual's scope. As it turned out, the issue was that the battery was indeed completely drained. From what I know now, it entered a state that required a 2-1/2 hour deep-charge. The face showed a massive red thunderbolt and no sign of active charging, alternating with the more encouraging charging cable icon. When the watch connected to MagSafe charging pad it didn't show any sign of active charging. I checked Apple Watch subReddit for guidance & one thread said to be patient while allowing it to charge for about 2-3 hours. Apple's site had additional, step-by-step guidelines that were also helpful, but Reddit's information is what gave me hope because Apple's 30 minute charging recommendation (when the red thunderbolt showed) turned out to be too little time for that sort of battery recovery.If you buy one of these watches, what I would recommend is to read the Apple Watch User Guide in advance, because what information arrived with the watch on the brief, 3-step pamphlet (from Kissa Electronics) doesn't represent the entire process or possibility that the battery might be completely drained. The online Apple Watch User Guide suggested trying different chargers, cleaning the charger & watch back, and other tips, but I wasn't prepared for that sort of experience. Since I couldn't verify if the supplied charger was operational, and thinking of one of Apple\u2019s suggestions, I felt more comfortable using my Nubeno 3-in-1 Folding Charging Station's 3W MagSafe pad over the generic MagSafe that was packed in with the watch because I've been using it for several months for my iPhone 16 Pro & AirPods Pro 2's and knew it was functional.After the deep charge, I was pleasantly surprised to see the red thunderbolt icon had vanished and in its place, the Series 8 watch face. All that was left was an OS update, pairing & cellular setup!! YAY. From that point on, my phone & watch took over the procedure and I was able to complete the setup by registering the watch with my cellular carrier. Pairing & activating cellular was flawless.At $222, from the original list price of $699, I think this offer is a wonderful cost-saving option if you aren't wanting a lighter weight aluminum model or newer series.

Garmin even has a solar-charging watch.That said, it has lasted longer than any of my (original company) Fitbits both in hardware and connectivity. My dog even chewed up the magnetic charger and it still works perfectly. I may look into Garmin brand watches (not Fitbit, which they now own) when it\u2019s time to replace it, though.",

It has no problems with overheating or any other issue. Generally, I only will upgrade items about every 5 years, so it\u2019s wonderful that it works with older and newer items.It\u2019s compact enough to easily carry in a purse, backpack or carry on. It\u2019s wonderful to charge my iPad M4, watch and phone at the same time!  And there\u2019s no need for a cord organizer anymore. Only one plug needed.The cord is a good length and there have been no issues with crimping or tearing. The length of the cord where the 3 split also provides plenty of room to charge 3 items even if they all need to be lying flat.",

The photo and description on the item I ordered clearly stated that it had the \"Titanium Milanese Band\" and \"USB-C\" charger. Neither was true and I tried to work with them to resolve this issue and they refused, falsely claiming that they were not using false advertising and that Apple requires they use this fake band. The band provided was a cheap Chinese steel knockoff of the magnetic style Milanese Loop used on the standard Apple watch series which doesn't suit this watch, not the Ultra Parachute Style real Titanium band one would expect and was shown in their photo (see image). Also, the USB charger is USB-A (not C) so I have to use an adapter. They did offer to refund the watch, but I needed it for a trip and decided to keep it. Hopefully they will change their deceptive marketing practices and try to make good on their promises. If they decide to resolve my concerns I will update my review, but for now BUYER BEWARE!",

I see after one person mentioned presentation, that improved greatly with mine lol.  Packaging aside, everything is working great, battery life is 100%.  The entire watch looks and feels brand new from the apple store.  The first day had me seriously concerned about the battery lasting though, but apparently the watch was just doing a lot of downloading and setting up in the background which was decreasing the battery by at least 20% per hour which I thought seemed nuts.  After changing some settings and getting things set up efficiently plus the set up process finalizing, everything is perfect.  Under normal circumstances it's been on for over an hour now with a few text alerts coming through etc. and battery is still 100%.  At this rate it should last a solid amount of time.  The apps on this are really cool.  The health stuff like heart monitoring and blood oxygen levels are awesome to have.  The workout apps are set up pretty nice as well.  It would be nice if there were a better way to do updates and whatnot though than doing it via your iphones bluetooth.  Like youtube reviews etc. mention it's sooooo slow.  I thought something was wrong with the watch at first.  Set up and downloading watchOS 10 take a solid 3-4 hours.  The install is beyond slow doing it via bluetooth.  Going through this thing with a fine tooth comb and getting every single app optimized for battery efficiency etc. took a good 12 plus hours and a ton of youtube videos all mentioning different little tips and tricks.  Lots of troubleshooting occurred too.  The complications on the watches face screen weren't functioning right which required to reset the location and privacy data in the phone plus a couple other steps.  The watch was doing a lot of weird stuff that was destroying it's battery and wasting storage at rapid speeds.  That's all just apple, nothing to do with it being renewed or the seller etc.  They all run the same software in them regardless.  Just being real about it, the set up process of this watch wasn't pleasant and kinda made me disappointed in the purchase initially but once I got that out of the way it's working incredibly well.  Also this being a cellular version, you need to contact your carrier in advance and register this with them via the IMEI number from the phone's about section.  You'll just get errors when trying to set up cellular prior to that.  All in all though, the watch is great,  and I love the design, especially how easy it is to switch out straps of whatever style or color you want.  Those are much cheaper than I expected them to be as well so I immediately grabbed a handful of different options.  Definitely recommend anyone interested in an apple watch to try this.  It shows up in brand new condition, these only came out less than a year ago so even original parts are still very lightly used with a long life ahead of them.  Even with a few frustrations, it gets two thumbs up from me.",

The screen also had some light scratches but was mostly not noticeable unless you really looked. Not a big deal I decided to look past those issues, even though I paid for an \u201cExcellent\u201d quality refurbished device.Upon turning the watch on I notice it glitched out a lot when I touched the screen. I figured it was cause I wasn\u2019t wearing it and was at a weird angle so my touches weren\u2019t registering right.I let it charge as it was on 3% out of the box and it took 4 hours to charge to 50%. It came with the old generation charger (USB not USB-C)  as well without a box if you\u2019re curious.When it finally charged I put it on and set it up. I immediately noticed the screen was not responsive and when it was it was incredibly glitchy. It would tap characters multiple times or just not respond at all. This is consistent every time I go to use the watch.I reached out to Amazon who referred me to the seller to see if they could offer a replacement. They did not. They refused to assist me guiding me to return the device through Amazon and get my money back.After coordinating with Amazon they agreed a return is the best solution and offered me a promo credit on my next purchase for the inconvenience and the sellers inability to resolve the problem.I also activated this device within my phone plan prior to confirming it was fully functional, but this is not anyone\u2019s fault but my own. I\u2019ll call that a personal loss. Just some advice to anyone purchasing an Apple Watch with intentions to activate it within their plan, test drive the watch a bit first. I\u2019m now out $50 and have a useless line on my phone plan that I cannot use until I purchase a new Apple Watch from a different seller.",

On my home screen, i keep on heart rate monitor, and i\u2019ll usually look at it. i think it\u2019s pretty accurate since if im sitting down, it\u2019ll be a lot slower then when im up and running around. I would say the heart rate monitoring is good. Finally, it charges pretty quickly. One thing that i was upset about personally was that it only had 82% battery health. However, i was only guaranteed that the health would be 80% or higher. I expected it to be more, but i got what i paid for. Finally, i\u2019ve been using the sleep monitoring for it to see how much i sleep, and it\u2019s been really nice. So many cool features. Definitely recommend!",

Also this being a cellular version, you need to contact your carrier in advance and register this with them via the IMEI number from the phone's about section.  You'll just get errors when trying to set up cellular prior to that.  All in all though, the watch is great,  and I love the design, especially how easy it is to switch out straps of whatever style or color you want.  Those are much cheaper than I expected them to be as well so I immediately grabbed a handful of different options.  Definitely recommend anyone interested in an apple watch to try this.  It shows up in brand new condition, these only came out less than a year ago so even original parts are still very lightly used with a long life ahead of them.  Even with a few frustrations, it gets two thumbs up from me.",

The quality of the watch is definitely like new and paired directly to my wife\u2019s phone with no hesitation. Apple health and all the features work like heart monitoring and o2 sensors, we bought a cover for it and it never gets scratched no matter how much we beat it/ everyday usage.",

        "review": "I purchased this Apple Watch refurbished with an \u201cExcellent\u201d quality rating. When it arrived it has some white scratches along the aluminum casing. The screen also had some light scratches but was mostly not noticeable unless you really looked. Not a big deal I decided to look past those issues, even though I paid for an \u201cExcellent\u201d quality refurbished device.Upon turning the watch on I notice it glitched out a lot when I touched the screen. I figured it was cause I wasn\u2019t wearing it and was at a weird angle so my touches weren\u2019t registering right.I let it charge as it was on 3% out of the box and it took 4 hours to charge to 50%. It came with the old generation charger (USB not USB-C)  as well without a box if you\u2019re curious.When it finally charged I put it on and set it up. I immediately noticed the screen was not responsive and when it was it was incredibly glitchy. It would tap characters multiple times or just not respond at all. This is consistent every time I go to use the watch.I reached out to Amazon who referred me to the seller to see if they could offer a replacement. They did not. They refused to assist me guiding me to return the device through Amazon and get my money back.After coordinating with Amazon they agreed a return is the best solution and offered me a promo credit on my next purchase for the inconvenience and the sellers inability to resolve the problem.I also activated this device within my phone plan prior to confirming it was fully functional, but this is not anyone\u2019s fault but my own. I\u2019ll call that a personal loss. Just some advice to anyone purchasing an Apple Watch with intentions to activate it within their plan, test drive the watch a bit first. I\u2019m now out $50 and have a useless line on my phone plan that I cannot use until I purchase a new Apple Watch from a different seller.",

It looked good, and the color of it was nice. I think it is very useful, especially for the price of it. I was surprised it was so cheap. On my home screen, i keep on heart rate monitor, and i\u2019ll usually look at it. i think it\u2019s pretty accurate since if im sitting down, it\u2019ll be a lot slower then when im up and running around. I would say the heart rate monitoring is good. Finally, it charges pretty quickly. One thing that i was upset about personally was that it only had 82% battery health. However, i was only guaranteed that the health would be 80% or higher. I expected it to be more, but i got what i paid for. Finally, i\u2019ve been using the sleep monitoring for it to see how much i sleep, and it\u2019s been really nice. So many cool features. Definitely recommend!",

It works well to top your watch off but the charge speed isn\u2019t as fast as it would be using the charging cable and wall outlet. The magnet on this charger doesn\u2019t feel quite as strong either, but as long as you aren\u2019t being careless this shouldn\u2019t be much of an issue. The build quality seems good and there is a colored light indicator that wraps around the body of the battery and indicates the level of charge you have remaining. Green is 66%-100%, Blue is 33%-65%, and Red is 10%-32%. It will flash red when you are under 9%. It uses a USB C to recharge, and has a single button for on/off. It also has a nice ring to be able to attach to something if you wanted.Overall I like the product and it has worked well for me.",

I needed to upgrade to Watch OS 10.3 but that went very quickly.  Pairing with iPhone wasn\u2019t a problem either.  Battery health measured 99%.  The ONLY issue that I had was with the enclosed wireless watch charger that came with the watch.  This charger was NOT an Apple or certified Apple charger.  This was an unmarked, no company name or logo 3rd party unit from Asia.  This charger would literally \u201ccook\u201d the watch when in use.  Thanks to Apple for installing a thermal shutdown in the watch otherwise I would of had a lithium battery fire on my kitchen counter.  The watch would shutdown the charging process but still was very \u201chot\u201d to the touch.  Some of these wireless battery chargers are ONLY rated for 5W using USB-C.  Good luck finding a 5W power unit.  I had one from an old Apple 6 phone that I was able to use and purchased a USB-A male to USB-C female adaptor to use as a watch charger unit.  DO NOT USE THE STANDARD 20W OR LARGER POWER UNITS.  Thermal shutdown will happen during charging.  Please don\u2019t leave the watch unattended while using these non-standard, un-certified wireless chargers.Overall I am very happy with the purchase with pricing point that I paid.  I didn\u2019t need the extra adventure of the wireless charging unit.  Too much drama to an otherwise great transaction.",

Everyone knows the specs and performance so I'm writing this review to point out that if you buy a renewed Apple Watch it doesn't come in the original box, but in a few plastic bags inside a non-descript box.  The back of the watch had a QC sticker on it.  Weeks later I am still trying to get the adhesive residue off the watch, which is really annoying.  Works as intended otherwise, but that seems like an easily avoidable inconvenience.",

I requested a replacement, hoping for better, but the second unit arrived in even worse cosmetic condition, with a battery health of just 87%.If a product is labeled \u201cExcellent,\u201d I expect minimal signs of use and a battery health that reflects that\u2014typically 95% or higher. In both cases, the watches clearly showed signs of prior use, and the battery performance did not meet the standard implied by the description.I think it\u2019s only fair to buyers that the condition rating be more transparent and accurate.

I had to buy USB-C spares but if you don't need that, the included works fine. Charges to full in about 2 hours as per Apple.Pretty much half the price of a cellular model in new retail box.

Watch came without issue, still under warranty until next winter so I'm thinking this is someone's quick holiday buyer's remorse return. 100% battery, no activation issues and signed up for cellular service without a hitch.Strap looks OEM, charging puck didn't show up on my Mac but since the SE 2 doesn't have fast charge, it doesn't really matter if the charging puck is OEM or third-party. I had to buy USB-C spares but if you don't need that, the included works fine. Charges to full in about 2 hours as per Apple.Pretty much half the price of a cellular model in new retail box. No fancy box but you decide if that's worth anything.",

I always put a case on my watches and it feels the same as the 45mm did. Screen size is so close I can\u2019t tell a difference. I upgraded to have the sleep apnea detection as I was concerned I was dealing with that. I also went from a GPS only to a cellular model. Just hooked it up so I can\u2019t say how that works. Anyway, I like that it\u2019s thinner-tho with a case, again, you can\u2019t really tell. Nothing to write home about, but good quality as expected from Apple. I bought refurbished, excellent condition and it was new in my opinion. Band, charger original Apple products . Zero flaws, 100% battery health, not a scratch or blemish. I\u2019ve changed the band and put the case on already. Pics are for size reference of 42mm with starlight case. I couldn\u2019t find pics of the watch with a case on it, online, and I wanted to see it. My wrist size is 170mm.",

I mostly use it to stream video from YouTube, Twitch, and all the streaming services like Netflix. The updated 6GB or RAM is also a great quality of life upgrade because I can now have more opened apps without having it refresh all the time.

Connect into network quite easily and has a tremendous amount of software available for it as well as compatible software with different operating systems. I still wish they made Removal batteries on these things but that\u2019s how the market works. It absolutely nothing to not like in my opinion and I definitely got my moneys worth.",

It's super light weight & perfect for traveling  or on the go.I\u2019ve been using this iPad for a few weeks now &  I\u2019m really so impressed. I bought the blue which is so pretty likewise the other color choices. It\u2019s super fast\u2014apps open instantly & everything runs smoothly. The screen looks amazing with bright and vibrant colors, & its perfect for watching shows or editing photos. Bought a pen which works perfectly  with it also.The battery lasts all day without a problem, even with heavy use whether its working, studying, streaming or gaming.If you\u2019re thinking about getting a ipad, it's a  great choice. I totally recommend it. Worth every dollar. Would recommend  over & over again.",

When I first got it, the initializing process took a bit longer than expected, which might have made it feel a little off. The screen did have some signs of wear, with light scratches visible, but since I use it at work every day, it\u2019s picked up a few more. It\u2019s not a huge issue though, as it still functions perfectly.In terms of durability, this watch holds up well. Despite the light scratches on the screen, it\u2019s proven to be pretty sturdy over time. I\u2019ve worn it every day, and it\u2019s taken a few bumps without any major damage. The build quality is solid, and even with the wear and tear from daily use, it still feels like a premium product.The charging ability is solid too. It charges up fairly quickly, and I\u2019ve never had issues with it not charging properly. As for the battery, it started at 97% health when I received it, and it\u2019s dropped to 93% now. Even with the slight decline, the battery still lasts me through a full day of work, so I haven\u2019t had to worry about it running out.The fitness tracker works great. It accurately tracks my workouts, heart rate, and daily activity, and I really appreciate the health metrics it provides. The Always-On Retina display is bright and clear, so I can easily check my stats or notifications during the day. The sound quality for calls and media is decent too. The speaker is loud enough for calls, and I can easily hear notifications or music when I need to.For a renewed model, the Apple Watch Series 8 has been a solid purchase. If you\u2019re okay with a few signs of wear and the minor drop in battery health, it\u2019s a great deal for the price. It performs really well for daily use and holds up nicely over time.",

This one had bad damage on the crown dial. Then on the opposite side there were 3 punctures and several severe scratches.This is NOT excellent condition!I reached out to this company to ask for a price adjustment and never got a response! They don\u2019t care about their customer service or the bad quality of the products they send! It\u2019s a scam! Check comments!!Returning the watch! I can get a better cleaner watch on eBay for a lesser price, even if not refurbished. I don\u2019t fully believe this company refurbished these watches anyway!

Or any listing by Digi.Take a look at the photos of this \u201crefurbished excellent condition\u201d watch!Per Amazon there needs to be 0 screen scratches mine had a pretty deep one on the curve of the screen.Body shouldn\u2019t have had any scratches seen from 12\u201d away. This one had bad damage on the crown dial. Then on the opposite side there were 3 punctures and several severe scratches.This is NOT excellent condition!I reached out to this company to ask for a price adjustment and never got a response! They don\u2019t care about their customer service or the bad quality of the products they send! It\u2019s a scam! Check comments!!Returning the watch! I can get a better cleaner watch on eBay for a lesser price, even if not refurbished. I don\u2019t fully believe this company refurbished these watches anyway! There isn\u2019t a warranty on this watch and there won\u2019t be one on the watch I get from eBay. At least the liter on eBay is honest and lists truthfully!",

I was confused at first because the case is so dark and the crown didn\u2019t appear to have the green ring, so i thought it was the wrong watch. Turns out it is green, like i ordered, just very dark and the crown was so worn from the previous owner that it had lost most of its color. I wish it was less worn, but still happy with it. (Difficult to see in the blurry close up picture of the crown, but you can just barely make out the last bits of the green color)",

Yes, $100 isn\u2019t cheap, but overall it was worth the extra cost.  My new Apple Watch 7 has a larger screen and no signs of use.  It\u2019s worth the upgrade, especially when Amazon describes the refurbished watch \u201clike new\u201d when that is clearly not the case.  Calls from the refurbished watch only worked half the time, and the speaker sounded muffled.  Just pony up for a new watch, which are discounted right now for an apple 7, and be happy.  Hope this updates helps you decide.Ok, the watch costs less than new, but that\u2019s about where the good stuff ends.  It did include a usb charger (Samsung brand! \ud83d\ude1f) generic charging cable, off-brand white strap, and poorly packaged in a generic white box.  Literally nothing was done to \u201crecondition\u201d the watch.  First thing I had to do was clean off the former user\u2019s grime that coated the watch back (yuck!).  This took some soap, water, and a toothbrush to clean out the little crevices.  Screen and case came with minor scratches overall, with one more annoying, more pronounced screen scratch that really bugs me.  Battery was completely depleted, which is not good for lithium batteries.  C\u2019mon, for the money you could at least clean and charge the thing!  It\u2019s not in terrible shape, but very clearly used.  It certainly was not refurbished in any way that I can tell.  Imagine buying the watch from your mom after she wore it for a year and you get the idea about my watch\u2019s condition.  Not abused, but certainly used.I\u2019m torn.  This was not a great purchase, and I\u2019m left wondering if its worth the $150 less than new price.  Hard to say.  Just don\u2019t believe the product description claiming \u201cappears new\u201d because that is far from the truth.  Set your expectations accordingly if you purchase from the \u201cCamera Guyz\u201d.  They just take the watch, toss it in a nondescript box with whatever knockoff bits they have laying around, and mail it to you.  Look, you\u2019re still paying a lot of money, so there\u2019s no reason not to expect a quality product.  Amazon says I have a 90 day warranty, so there\u2019s time (accidental pun) to evaluate it further.  Yes it works.  Yes, I will eventually add more wear and tear to the watch when wearing.  Yes, the \u201cappears new\u201d description is complete fiction.  Overall value is debatable.  One star for inaccurate condition description and an annoying screen scratch.",

I charged it, updated it and bluetoothed it to my Iphone with no issues. I then added a data plan to it and use it everyday and it has never failed me. The screen is bright, full of color, I can easily scroll thru the menus, I can personalize with my own photos, set up alarms and it works without issue paired to my Iphone. I chose the color red since I am a Niner fan and during football season it goes will with Niner red.  I love the watch and will be switching up to a Series 9 soon but the Series 7 is awesome. I ordered the 45mm and the size is just fine.",

I opted for a refurbished product and am extremely pleased. It looks and behaves like a brand new watch. I put off writing a review until I'd had it for long enough to feel it would have shown me any faults other buyers might want to know. I haven't found any.I have several different bands. The mesh ones (as other reviews will tell you) tend to get tiny breaks in the links that catch on things, but the bands are inexpensive, so economically replaceable. All the watch faces are fun to try out and change your mind about. The watch interfaces nicely with your phone, so you don't have to try to read tiny little type on your watch (though you can, if you wish). You will find that if you want to answer calls via your watch you'll have to pay your phone provider for the privilege, but you don't have to do that, so can dispense with that cost.All in all, I'm very happy with my refurbished Apple watach",

There is no setup instructions in the box I received. I could not get the watch to go through the setup routine where it could pair to my iPhone's bluetooth and from there access my Apple account. I was prepared to return it but then thought, maybe when they refurbed this (whatever that entails) they didn't reset to the watch to factory settings.I went to the area on the watch where I could erase all data and bring it back to factory settings. That solved the problem.So, if you are looking at your refurbed watch and it isn't walking you through the new phone setup steps. Do a total erase of all data and nonfactory apps and start fresh. It worked for me hopefully it will work for you.",

I bought it and the 2 year warranty with the idea that in two years I would want a new one anyhow!! It works great and am so glad I gave the refurbished one a shot. It wears well, the band even still looks great after several months of daily wear. It charges fine and the size is perfect.  I f you haven't jumped on the Apple Watch trend, you really should!!",

I opted for a refurbished product and am extremely pleased. It looks and behaves like a brand new watch. I put off writing a review until I'd had it for long enough to feel it would have shown me any faults other buyers might want to know. I haven't found any.I have several different bands. The mesh ones (as other reviews will tell you) tend to get tiny breaks in the links that catch on things, but the bands are inexpensive, so economically replaceable. All the watch faces are fun to try out and change your mind about. The watch interfaces nicely with your phone, so you don't have to try to read tiny little type on your watch (though you can, if you wish). You will find that if you want to answer calls via your watch you'll have to pay your phone provider for the privilege, but you don't have to do that, so can dispense with that cost.All in all, I'm very happy with my refurbished Apple watach",

There is no setup instructions in the box I received. I could not get the watch to go through the setup routine where it could pair to my iPhone's bluetooth and from there access my Apple account. I was prepared to return it but then thought, maybe when they refurbed this (whatever that entails) they didn't reset to the watch to factory settings.I went to the area on the watch where I could erase all data and bring it back to factory settings. That solved the problem.So, if you are looking at your refurbed watch and it isn't walking you through the new phone setup steps. Do a total erase of all data and nonfactory apps and start fresh. It worked for me hopefully it will work for you.",

It was submerged in the hot tub for approx. 3 hours and is totally fine.  Honestly- best choice I could have made for her for a contact device . So impressed.",

Works great. Looks new. Took awhile to get set up with our service due to loosing another watch and needing moms phone to approve phone numbers and calls. But Lordy I finally got what I needed. Pro tip the cell ready watches have a thin red ring on the dial/button on the side for quick reference.",

I was very happy with the quality of the product once it arrived. the watch's battery health is at 100%, there are no scratches on the screen, and there are a minimal amount of scuffs along the top and bottom sides of the watch itself that I don't notice. i've been wearing the watch for about two weeks and i haven't noticed any problems. if I didn't know this was refurbished, i would think it was brand new.I had initially bought this same product directly from amazon for a slightly cheaper price, but the watch i received was highly scratched and scuffed. i returned that one, bought the same product from Russ Enterprises, and was much more satisfied with the quality of their product. I know that i'm relatively lucky and not all refurbished watches will come as pristine as the one I received, but especially after comparing the products from the two sellers, I would definitely recommend buying specifically from Russ Enterprises.",

        "review": "The Apple Watch SE (2nd Generation) [GPS 40mm] with a Silver Aluminum Case and Storm Blue Sport Band is a popular option in Apple's smartwatch lineup. Here's a brief review focusing on its features and potential limitations:Pros:Design and Aesthetics: The silver aluminum case paired with the storm blue sport band offers a sleek and modern look, appealing to a wide range of users. The design is both stylish and functional.Performance: As a 2nd generation model, it boasts improved performance over its predecessor, with faster and more efficient processing capabilities.Health and Fitness Tracking: The watch excels in health and fitness tracking, offering a variety of features like heart rate monitoring, step counting, and workout tracking, making it ideal for fitness enthusiasts.User Interface and Experience: The watchOS provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, with easy navigation and access to a wide range of apps and functionalities.Battery Life: It offers a decent battery life for a smartwatch, sufficient for daily use without frequent recharging.Cons:Price: While more affordable than some other models in the Apple Watch series, it still carries a relatively high price tag, which might be a consideration for budget-conscious buyers.Limited Compatibility: Best suited for users already within the Apple ecosystem, as some features might not be fully available or optimized when paired with non-Apple devices.No Always-On Display: Unlike the higher-end models, the SE does not feature an always-on display, which means the screen goes dark when not in use.Health Features: While it has robust health tracking, it lacks some of the advanced health features found in the more expensive Apple Watch models, such as blood oxygen monitoring and ECG.In summary, the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) [GPS 40mm] with a Silver Aluminum Case and Storm Blue Sport Band is a stylish and capable smartwatch, offering a balanced mix of features and performance. It's an excellent choice for those who prioritize health and fitness tracking, seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem, and a modern design. However, its price, compatibility limitations with non-Apple products, and the absence of some advanced health features are factors to consider.",

        "review": "I've had several fitness and smartwatches over the years, but the Apple Watch SE truly stands out. This watch is incredibly accurate in tracking active calories burned, which has been essential for maintaining my calorie deficit eating plan. The heart rate monitoring, especially during my morning cardio workouts, is spot on. The look and fit of the band are excellent, although there's a bit of a learning curve to fastening it securely, but once it's on, it stays put.One minor drawback is the battery life; it does tend to be quite power-hungry. After watching a few YouTube videos and tweaking some settings, I managed to conserve battery life more effectively. However, you'll still need to charge it daily for about an hour. Despite this, the features and accuracy of the Apple Watch SE make it a worthy investment, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable fitness partner and stylish accessory.",

        "review": "For years I put off getting an Apple watch because I didn't think it would compare to my Garmin watches or be as tough as my G-Shocks.  While some of that is true this is still an item that I found to be worth the purchase.  It is my go to watch at the office because it helps me keep up with meetings, texts, phone calls and what my kids are up to (i.e. location services).  Because of the Apple watch I also find that I am not constantly grabbing my phone as most things I can simply turn my wrist to see and respond to.  The only reason it was not a 5 star for me is you pretty much have to charge it each night.  Not a deal breaker for me as I am not looking to sleep in it anyway but better battery life would be nice.  Really easy to use and there are lots of channels like \"Watch Jumble\" on YT that provide easy step by step directions to get you started.  Well worth it, I wish I would have bought one earlier.",

        "review": "I bought this watch for my 19-year-old daughter for the medical aspects of this watch and also the crash detection. We always worry about our teens and young adults nowadays and this brings me a little peace of mind. She also has a medical condition.I like that it doesn\u2019t need to be charged every 12 hours like my Series 5 model.  The battery was still at 70 percent by the time I went to bed.Compared to the Fitbit, that thing doesn\u2019t need to be charged but every six days. It\u2019s amazing. However, I noticed that the Versa 4 was causing me to lose calls when I would use my earbuds. I\u2019m often times hands-free and when I go to answer with my earbud it would hang up on them instead.I don\u2019t have that happen on this watch. Maybe it\u2019s something Apple did intentionally so that we only use their products? lolI\u2019m not a fan of the band they sent me with the watch but it works and I can always change it for her.I did end up buying Amazon\u2019s insurance which I recommend especially when buying refurbished or renewed as they like to call it.So far I\u2019m really happy with what we got.",
