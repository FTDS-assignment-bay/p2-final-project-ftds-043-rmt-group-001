        "review": "My orginal review was correct but after getting things set up the way that I want, it is a great actvity tracker.1. Battery Life is amazing! If you are like me you hate when you are working out and the watch dies not recoding the steps or activities. This watch will last for 7 days2. The app is easy to use- If you are serious about measuring your activity great way to see how you are doing for the last several days, weeks, months...3. It measures what I care about steps and activityThe watch is not for you if you want-1. seeing emails and texts (not a strong feature)2. Trying to use it to answer callsI change my three stars to five stars after using it for awhile. The band and the orginal watch setup was not well designed but you can order a band for $10 and change the watch screen (use google to search how to do it, it is not hard but not obvious).The amazing battery life was what pushed it to 5 stars.Orginal Review-I had a Versa 2 and really liked it. I have very basic usages-steps, activity and as a watch. It did a wonderful job. It died and so I bought the Versa 4. 1. the watch ban is cheap!! the versa 2 was nothing great but this one is awful. (so i will have to buy another one to replace the one that comes with it). 2. the new watch face trys to do too much. KISS should have been there moto Keep it simple stupid. 3 the sync with the app seems to be off. I just got it so it just might take more time to get use to it.Im sure in the end it will be ok and do it's job. That is why 3 stars.",

        "review": "When I first got this, it would not maintain sync.  I updated the firmware on the watch, tried doing a factory reset twice, uninstalled/reinstalled the fitbit app twice, ensured that the app wasn't allowed to go to sleep when in the background... nothing worked.  It would work for a few minutes, then when I tried to command Alexa, it would say connection lost.  I decided to contact support, and they informed me that my app was outdated.  Come to find out, version 4.04 of the bitbit app is too old, and will not work.  The latest version, 4.06.7 had not been released for my phone yet, as is typical ridiculous play store behavior.  Google... are you listening?  When a developer releases an update, you shall IMMEDIATELY make it available to EVERY device!  I manually downloaded the apk and installed it, and everything has been working great since.  Alexa follows my direct orders immediately, phone calls come through, texts come through, and I can sync with ease.Overall, I suppose this is an improvement over the Versa 2.  Screen is a little bigger, but the notification vibrations don't seem to be as forceful, even when set to strong.This uses google wallet instead of google pay as the Versa 2 did, so my AmEx will not work for contactless payment.Phone call feature is nice, seems to work OK.  I can hear them, they can hear me.  You can only answer calls, you can't make them.  The $50 brand x watch I ordered to replace this one before I got the sync figured out was able to do that.  It could also control my camera and music player, neither of which is possible on the Versa 4.Google maps is nice if you walk in unfamiliar areas.  I'll probably never need it, but it's nice.Battery life seems to be improved over the Versa 2, but mine was 2 years old so I'm sure the battery had gradually decreased it's charge capacity.  I used it for several days, and he battery was still at 55%.Skin temperature sensor will one day be nice when it can sync with a smart thermostat and automatically adjust the temperature as needed.  But for now, it's just a novelty and has no purpose.  Yes, I know my skin is hot.  I woke up in a puddle of sweat.  Yup, I'm freezing, so my skin is cold.o2 saturation is nice if you have any relevant health problems.If you want to take full advantage of the watch, get the free \"Overview\" clock face by Chris Blyth.  It gives you current and average heart rate, battery percentage, fully customizable date format, allows for a larger clock that shows seconds, and you can have weather, and 6 other health stats displayed on the main screen, all at once.  I have steps, distance, calories burned, active zone minutes, floors, and BMI/BMR.  It all fits, and is easy to read.  Vast improvement over the default face, which shows no useful information.  I had th is face on my versa 2, and loved it.  So glad it's available for the 4.Bottom line, it's a good watch.  There are cheaper brand x ones out there, but none of them have NFC payment, and not all of them have Alexa.  And, you get what you pay for.  fit & finish feels cheap, the screens get washed out in the sun, finicky alexa integration and so on.  Best to pony up and get a refined product.  Be sure to update your fitbit app.  Their customer support said the latest version should be released within a week, but I circumvented the beurocracy and downloaded it manually.  Why wait?",

        "review": "I use to have the fitbit 3 se and loved it for 3 years and i tried the samsung 4 for all the bells and whistles but the charge lasted a day which to me is counterproductive. I decided to go back to my fitbit since I also enjoyed the platform more for recording all my data such as food ect. I missed the barcode feature when putting in your meals. I use mine more strictly for steps, 24 heart rate, sleep analysis, contactless payments and tracking all my workouts. I'm not a runner anymore so I haven't used the built in GPS but based on technical reviews I didn't miss out. It's a fairly new concept which needs more software updates to be fully functional and not drain the battery life to oblivion. My fitbit actually lasts me a little over 8 days this is with turning the always on display off, txt message notifications off ( I don't see a need for this since I'm not one to utilize too many short message replies). And having the display brightness set to dim and even in full sun I can still see the display very crisply. The contactless payments uses Google pay which if you are already an android user with a Google pay wallet set up was easy and I like that for security reasons it only is set for 24 hour use after putting in your 4 digit code before having to reinput your code. Now the code input is trivial to me I don't like the setup for it. The water resistance is good I haven't showered with the device but the waterlock works well when I wash my hands multiple times a day being a nurse. I have not tested it swimming for the 50 meter water resistance claim. The workout options have improved with more options and now I'm able keep track of my active zone minutes. The heart rate tracking during exercises is said to be more accurate than the charge 5 based on tech data analysis reviews that I researched before hand. The downside is Spotify was removed and replaces with YouTube music in which you will need a subscription for. The 1.4 inch amoled size is perfect if you aren't a huge fan of having a bulky tracker on your wrist. You also now have the option of syncing your device with other heart rate monitoring equipment/workout machines including peloton but for me isn't useful. It has a haptic side button now that was seen in older models which i prefer. Another great feature is the addition of Google maps for those are are runners but again you may compromise the battery life. Since Google bought fitbit there will be more Google geared software. For more health features you now have the eda and ecd scan no BP monitor like on my samsung 4 to my knowledge has pased fda as of yet. You also have a skin temperature sensor like in the fitbit sense how accurate I'm unsure it would need to be tested against something like a NTC thermistor. The sleep analysis data seems overall accurate. I also do use a cpap machine. Overall for the price I think it's a more than suitable tracking device with its more updated hr monitoring compared to other apple watches, garmins and huawei. Still room for improvement such as the built in GPS. I think the GPS should just be mirrored on your phone which is still an option on the charge 6 you can chose dynamic, built in or phone. I would stick with phone to preserve battery but in all I recommend this product.",

        "review": "I had my old FitBit Charge 4 for 5 years. The band broke off at year 2, so I would put it in a pocket or in a sock while I went about my day....worked great, just easy to lose that way. We were on vacation and it just died. I had really gotten used to having a FitBit to track steps (really all I do). Amazon had the Charge 6 for a good price, and it was almost seamless to set this up. I love the ability to change the clock face. It does track sleep but I'm not sure it's accurate. No matter. It tracks my steps, reminds me to move when I am sitting, notifies me if my phone is ringing when my ringer is off, and (bonus) I can see what time it is on my wrist. Glad I bought this one",

        "review": "Bought January 2024. So, I have had an Apple Watch since 2017. I LOVED it. But I didn\u2019t love the battery time. The things I was interested in, like sleep tracking, I couldn\u2019t do because it needed to charge or I couldn\u2019t use it the next day. My mom has a Fitbit and for years was telling me to get one. After some health issues, I needed to start being more cognizant of my health. I didn\u2019t want to spend another $5-600 on an Apple Watch that at most gets 2 days of battery now. I was interested in the Oura ring, but I have 60 lbs. to lose and those can\u2019t be sized as you lose weight. So I researched and found the Fitbit Charge 6 was my best choice.Mostly pro\u2019s.It is really comfortable. When I fell asleep accidentally with the Apple Watch my wrist was sore after. So far, I\u2019m getting 6-7 days of charge out of it, which is a game changer. I now don\u2019t miss days of tracking because I forgot to charge it.I feel like the screen size is appropriate and it\u2019s well made. I\u2019m not sure about the accuracy, but reviews I\u2019ve watched where people test them they seem close enough. And that\u2019s good enough for me, I want a baseline.You can adjust the haptics for notifications, I have it on the hardest vibration and it\u2019s awesome. It\u2019s easy to read the screen, just 2 taps. It says you can water lock it for swimming/shower but I haven\u2019t utilized that yet.The app\u2026 okay so when I purchased this (January 2024) they offered the premium app for 6 months free, then $80 a year. I will be keeping the premium. It still can be used without, but I want ALL the metrics you can get as well as meditations and workouts. It has replaced MyFitnessPal because I can track everything in this app. It also links with my Bluetooth scale. You can track steps, miles, calories, exercise, activity minutes (150 minutes a week as recommended), standing activity by getting up every hour for 250 steps, (it reminds you). SpO2, HRV, skin temp., HR, sleep (including stages). I\u2019m sure I\u2019m forgetting something. I haven\u2019t used the GPS function which I heard drains the battery significantly.Somewhat cons, or things I would appreciate it having. This device is logged in through Google. I do see messages and notifications from my iPhone 13, but are unable to respond which is fine. You can control YouTube music, but not your Apple Music. It\u2019s Just an adjustment from my Apple Watch. I\u2019m also not able to sync it with Apple Maps because I hate Google maps. And I haven\u2019t figured out how to use that between my phone and the Fitbit yet even after watching tutorials. I wish they had more watch faces to choose from, I think there was about 12?. I just felt like the one I picked was as close to what I wanted, but it wasn\u2019t. The time takes up a large portion of the screen which I feel like is unnecessary. What I feel the app is lacking is something to track when you\u2019ve taken your meds. If they did, this app would literally be a one stop shop for my health/fitness tracking. Note: a comment someone made about med tracking was just set an alarm. The problem is that if you are someone like me that is never at the same place everyday, you could turn the alarm off and then forget later whether or not you took them. It\u2019s a really quick fix they could do.I HIGHLY recommend the Charge 6, I wish I had listened to my mom and got it a while ago. The few things I gave up by switching from my Apple Watch is minor. I\u2019m not missing them other than Apple Maps and Music.",

        "review": "Initially, I purchased this watch to help me track my heart rate zones while swimming. Truthfully, that didn\u2019t really work out exactly according to plan. Yes, it is waterproof for swimming. Yes, it does track laps and show you zone minutes IN THE APP after your swim is complete. I was looking for something I could monitor during swim to make sure my heart rate was in zone 3 for fat burning. So, this didn\u2019t do exactly what I hoped. HOWEVER, the watch has been absolutely fantastic and does far more than I expected it to. The battery life is amazing, the accuracy is great, no issues with connectivity ever. I wear it 24/7 and it has helped me really understand my health. I log my water intake, I connected it to MyfitnessPal for tracking macros/calories, and it has seriously helped me understand my activity level and sleeping patterns. 10/10 recommend if you\u2019re looking for a fitness watch, worth every penny.",

What I really like about this tracker is the smaller size.  When my Charge 5 died (tried to wash it off under the faucet), I looked into the Charge 6.  Reviews were not reassuring.  So this one had more positive reviews and thought I\u2019d give it shot.  So far it\u2019s been great.  Easy to use, display responds well to touch, screen is legible, and it supports just what I need.  Plus, it\u2019s less $$ than the new Charge.  At this point very happy with my purchase.  Recommended. Will follow up with updates as needed.Update 5-10-24. So within three days battery dropped to 19%.  A disappointment given the description states up to 10 days.  So I made a few changes in the watch configuration and fully recharged.  After36hours battery is at 66%.  A week would be acceptable but anything less a disappointment.Update 5-13-24. Turned off always on display.  Battery at 44% after 6 days, not bad.  Happy I bought this tracker over the Charge 6.Update 6-1-24 Ok, I really like this tracker.  Soooo glad I bought it over the Charge 6.  It has yet to disappoint me and Im getting at least 8-9 days from a charge.  Best part is I like the small profile and simplicity of the display.  I see the large display watches and trackers and wonder why anyone would want such a clunky device on their wrist.  Now if you wants apps, fancy displays, emergency calling, and all parameters on one screen, this tracker is not for you.  So glad I made this purchase.1-25-25. So the original Fitbit functionality was great throughout the past 9 months until the hinge point of the strap failed.  The plastic where the pin secures the strap to the watch fractured.  What to do?  I tried some epoxy, worked for a few weeks.  So I just ordered a new watch.  Unfortunately, the watch gave me less than one year of service.  Had it not been for its otherwise excellent performance I would have considered abandoning Fitbit.  But I went and ordered a new one.  Seems the watch is a disposable item with a life expectancy of less than a year.  Too bad, seems few things in life have consistent longevity.  I\u2019ll have to see how long this one keeps me happy.  I\u2019m not going to deduct a star at this point.  We\u2019ll just have to see how this goes.4-11-25  I really like this device.  it has performed well.  I've been reading a few negative reviews.  Seems people expect too much from a small rather inexpensive fitness watch.  This device is great as a tracker but is not without fault.  Keep that in mind and you won't be disappointed.  I think others feel they should get the equivalent of an expensive electrocardiogram or sleep results that you can only get from visiting a sleep center.  Ain't gonna happen.  Just use the device as it is intended, as a tracker.  Overall, once the tracker has accumulated enough data on your habits, it will serve as a reliable reflection of your exercise and health.  I think it is worth it and would buy another.7-10-25  A few more months of use.  No complaints.  Good tracker.  I sync it up with my iPhone and iPad.  Sometimes it goes ok other times I need to pair it again.  But not a major issue as it does catch up with the latest data.  I rely on this compact tracker quite a bit for my steps, distance walked, exercise time, and general sleep quality.  it also seems stop on with my resting heart rate.  I still like it very much and would buy again.",

After going through the washer on heavy the night before.I grabbed him and realized that this time I had really messed up, he was more than lost this time, he was lost to the world. But for you know whats and giggles, I plugged him into the charger.He works. He looks completely normal. Nothing is off.In a time when technology is so fragile, when we are constantly fighting planned obsolescence, this little Fitbit is a reminder that sometimes technology can go above and beyond what is expected.

I\u2019ve tried a few smartwatches over the years, but this one stands out because it actually helps me stay on top of my health without being overwhelming.What\u2019s working well:Stress tracking: The built-in sensor that tracks stress throughout the day has been more useful than I expected. It lets me know when I\u2019m a bit too tense and reminds me to take a breather.Sleep tracking: Super detailed and pretty accurate. It\u2019s not just telling me how long I slept, it\u2019s breaking it down into stages and helping me figure out why some nights feel more restful than others.Health features: Between heart rate, skin temperature, and blood oxygen tracking, I feel like I\u2019ve got a better grip on how I\u2019m doing overall. It\u2019s not medical-grade, of course, but it\u2019s enough to be helpful.Battery life: I easily get 5\u20136 days per charge, which is great since I wear it overnight for sleep tracking.Comfort and design: It looks good and wears comfortably. Lightweight and low-profile, which I appreciate.Things to keep in mind:It\u2019s not a full-blown smartwatch with tons of apps or customization options. It\u2019s built for health tracking, and it stays in that lane.You can\u2019t type out full text messages on it, just use quick replies or voice-to-text. That hasn\u2019t been an issue for me, but it\u2019s worth knowing.If you're looking for a smartwatch that focuses on wellness and helps you build better habits, this is a great pick. It doesn\u2019t try to do everything, but what it does, it does really well. I\u2019d recommend it to anyone looking to track their health in a simple, reliable way.",

        "review": "I purchased this watch primarily for its continuous heart monitoring, ECG app, sleep monitoring, plus some basic fitness like steps and stairs.It was easy to install. I was pleased to be able to turn off the GPS and Alexa which may have been good for an extra day of battery life. I was able to turn off the fitness nags. I've been running and working out over 40 years and don't need nags. I was also able to skip the Premium service since I don't want a monthly bill and don't want other nagging.There are a huge number of watch faces available. I focused only on free watch faces. One thing that wasn't clear is that apparently you can only install 6 faces on the  watch. When I found a better choice, it wouldn't install and had no useful explanation of why not. I ended up looking specifically for watch faces that included a battery indicator (surprisingly not universal!) and basic fitness figures. The hard part was finding watch faces that increased the font size of the battery % and fitness figures so they were more easily legible to older eyes.The biggest problem is with the watch band. I have a narrow wrist and bands with holes like the OEM band are never spaced in a way that fits well. So I ordered a new band that is metal mesh and uses a clamp to fix the length. That works to get a comfortable fit, but is a pain to put on. Good thing I only take the watch off once a day! So I tried another watch band that had a folding clasp, like my old watch band, and is adjusted in length by removing links. The whole process of removing links was a serious pain, requiring a magnifying ring light and great patience. And the link removal did not yield a snug and comfortable fit, just as with the OEM watch band. Back to the band that works, for now.Update. I just discovered it is possible, apparently, to get an adapter from my old watch band that attaches to the watch with pins to the FitBit clamp system. I'm hoping that will allow me to use my old watch band which was excellent.Further update:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN1RVM5W?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsThis adapter took a long time to arrive all the way from China, but it worked perfectly. My old watch band was a 20mm band with adjustable sizing clamp and a folding clasp to take it on and off:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CY5D2LB/ref=pe_2313400_740551120_em_1p_0_lm?th=1Now I have the best of all worlds. A good watch and it is easy to put on and take off with a snug fit. I wonder why no one seems to make this style of watch band specifically to fit the FitBit?",

Makes it super easy to track in and out calories because it's already done.I primarily do weightlifting/powerlifting/bodybuilding and I'm currently taking a break due to injuries, and using this for everyday fitness is superb. Can't wait to see how it is when I'm back in the gym. The sleep stats are phenomenal as well. I already notice my sleep habits changing.I did notice a few glitchy things, like the weather and sync issues. But these aren't a problem if you give it proper time to catch up. Meaning, if you check it immediately in the morning (like me) it won't sync properly. Just give it 20 mins and go about your routine and it will catch up.Can't recommend this any more. If you're thinking about one, just buy it.",

        "review": "Finally, after failing twice with Gizmo watches for my older kids, we found success with this watch for my 3rd child. It is simply the best kid's smartwatch we've owned BY FAR.Pro's: This watch looks great, performs above expectations and my daughter loves it.1. The sound quality is more than adequate on the other callers end. It's not perfect on the Fitbit end but it's very close when it comes to clarity.2. The fact that my daughter has to meet certain fitness goals (steps) in order to unlock any game features is such a great idea. She will go out of her way to meet the step goal every day and every month just so she can be earn new games. It's so cool.3. School mode allows the parents to put the watch in a Do Not Disturb mode during school hours in order to keep them from being distracted but still allowing them to accumulate steps4. It looks great5. The touchscreen is responsive and simple to use6. The texting is easy and convenient. Allowing her to talk to text and also send vocal recordings is awesome.7. The tracking feature is very accurateCons:1. The battery drains pretty quickly. It is of course, affected by how much she uses it, but on average it only lasts around 24 hours. Either way, we bought a charger stand made specially for the device and she easily charges it while she sleeps.2. I wish we could just simply press once to toggle school mode. Instead you have to go into settings and find it. It won't allow a single call or text go through in this mode. I bet you're thinking \"That's what it's supposed to do.\" You're right, but in an actual emergency while in school mode, she would have no way to reach us and vice versa. I wish there was a simple way to toggle it on both ends. For example, the other day my oldest son dropped my daughter off at her friend's house the other day. Unfortunately, the friends weren't home but my son had already left her there. She's 9, so she freaked out when she realized she was alone. This happened on a snow day so school was cancelled. The watch would not allow my daughter to call us for help. Even though there was no school, the watch was still is school mode. (After crying a while, she's doing great now btw).All of that said, this is well worth the cost!",

Somehow even faster than Find My for iPhones (works off WiFi).- Text messages, calls and voice messages are quick and responsive (works off WiFi).- Dedicated ACE parental app works very well on iPhone, with good parental controls- Peace of mind of a \u201cclosed\u201d ecosystem. My kids can\u2019t message anyone.Neutral- Data plan is independent of any carrier.- Battery life of meh, but it charges very fast. It\u2019ll get though about a day depending on screen brightness and use.Cons- Fitbits historical reputation for reliability and support is very sub-par with some of their devices. Time will tell. This device is well made and operates smoothly so far.Games- Fitness challenges- Scout the fitness coach- Decorate a house with items purchased by movement/activity- Golf and other mini gamesAs a parent I wanted to be able to keep on touch with my kids as they go to friend\u2019s houses, field trips, etc. I also want them to feel that I\u2019m still accessible when they\u2019re away somewhere. My kids are 10 and 7. I feel age 6-13 is the perfect age range for a device like this.This watch costs a good amount more than a Gizmo or other watches. The cost is similar to an Apple Watch SE. But this Fitbit is a purpose-made device for kids unlike the Apple Watch. The Fitbit encourages movement and play. It\u2019s genuinely fun UI is more appealing to kids than the utilitarian Apple Watch UI. In my opinion the Fitbit is also safer to use, limiting their ability to communicate with anyone except myself, my wife, and their siblings.I sincerely hope Fitbit follows the fun gamification philosophy for adult Fitbits as well. What a fun and exciting device to encourage movement and creative play. We immediately bought a second watch for our second younger child.I will update this review if I have anything new to add.",

I can see my phone's notifications easily so I don't have to pull out my phone each time. I like the heart rate tracking function. I don't use most of the other activity functions but it has a pretty good step counter too. It has a find phone function that works well as long as you are within Bluetooth range. I've needed that a couple times so far. I'm not crazy about the stop watch feature because you can't start it then go back to the other menus, like looking at the time, without stopping the stop watch. If you can, I haven't figured it out. Battery life is good, I usually charge it once a week or so. It's been completely water resistant when I shower and even had a water lock you can turn on so the water droplets don't trigger touch input. It seems durable enough for regular wear and use, but I wouldn't test crushing it on purpose. App pairing was pretty easy the first time but when I got a new phone I had a little trouble unpairing and repairing to the new phone, I ended up factory resetting it but it isn't really a problem because all your info is stored in the app and cloud. Sleep tracking seems pretty accurate. I do wish I could customize the features a little more, like it does activity tracking with \"zone minutes\" but I really don't care about that, but it still shows up as I tap through the metrics on the watch home screen. Same with calorie burning. Not sure how accurate the calorie burning tracker is.All in all it's a great watch. I wanted a modern style smartwatch without getting something very expensive or really bulky. This is the right watch for the right price.",

This FitBit does all that and tracks it in a simple and intuitive app.  I can also wear it when I want to wear a mechanical watch and not look like an idiot wearing two watches (i.e., mechanical watch and apple watch).",

It has a sleek look that can be customized with different band options and looks really cute in a bracelet stack. I personally use it to track my heart rate, and I like that it records it overnight for me too. The sleep tracking feature also helps me properly plan my day according to the amount of rest I got to prevent extra fatigue. I've used it in beauty school and outdoors and never experienced any bugs or issues in general (I do take it off if I know I'll be splashing water around, protect your devices), so the functionality is amazing. The different band sizes accommodate a huge range of sizes, but I bought a separate elastic band because the standard ones aren't very comfortable for long-term wear and may cause irritation after a while, especially if you're sweating or washing your hands a lot.",

        "review": "I mainly bought this fitbit to monitor my nightly sleep quality, although the overall health monitoring is a plus. 4 sleep stages are monitored: Deep, Light, REM, and Awake. Since it's all monitored at the wrist, the accuracy is unknown; however, the desired 10-20% of deep sleep (of the total) appears to be attained. Also, patterns can be seen, such as decreasing deep sleep if caffeine has been ingested. For O2, it only measures average variance; I wish it would give absolute reading over time like an SPO2 monitor that can be shown on a time chart. Also, the data can be downloaded to local computer, but it is tedious to use for a charting app, and is separated into various folders. It appears that only the fitbit app can use the data easily. It also monitors steps automatically, and exercise (start/stop manually). Other things are monitored, like cardio load, daily exercise, active zone, burned energy, etc. Weight can be input automatically with another app sync. If food and water monitoring is desired, it must be manually input.",

        "review": "I really love this watch. It has a slim profile and a nice little touch screen. It tells the time. I can see my phone's notifications easily so I don't have to pull out my phone each time. I like the heart rate tracking function. I don't use most of the other activity functions but it has a pretty good step counter too. It has a find phone function that works well as long as you are within Bluetooth range. I've needed that a couple times so far. I'm not crazy about the stop watch feature because you can't start it then go back to the other menus, like looking at the time, without stopping the stop watch. If you can, I haven't figured it out. Battery life is good, I usually charge it once a week or so. It's been completely water resistant when I shower and even had a water lock you can turn on so the water droplets don't trigger touch input. It seems durable enough for regular wear and use, but I wouldn't test crushing it on purpose. App pairing was pretty easy the first time but when I got a new phone I had a little trouble unpairing and repairing to the new phone, I ended up factory resetting it but it isn't really a problem because all your info is stored in the app and cloud. Sleep tracking seems pretty accurate. I do wish I could customize the features a little more, like it does activity tracking with \"zone minutes\" but I really don't care about that, but it still shows up as I tap through the metrics on the watch home screen. Same with calorie burning. Not sure how accurate the calorie burning tracker is.All in all it's a great watch. I wanted a modern style smartwatch without getting something very expensive or really bulky. This is the right watch for the right price.",

Got this FitBit because it was cheap and wanted something I could wear for a few days and also track my sleep.  This does what I was hoping for and also found the FitBit app to be more useful with what I am tracking vs. the Apple fitness app. I am tracking  my steps, calories burned, calories consumed, weight, water consumption, heart rate and sleep quality / hours.  This FitBit does all that and tracks it in a simple and intuitive app.  I can also wear it when I want to wear a mechanical watch and not look like an idiot wearing two watches (i.e., mechanical watch and apple watch).",

        "review": "This is a great, affordable option for people who just need the basics without the bulky build of other smartwatches. It has a sleek look that can be customized with different band options and looks really cute in a bracelet stack. I personally use it to track my heart rate, and I like that it records it overnight for me too. The sleep tracking feature also helps me properly plan my day according to the amount of rest I got to prevent extra fatigue. I've used it in beauty school and outdoors and never experienced any bugs or issues in general (I do take it off if I know I'll be splashing water around, protect your devices), so the functionality is amazing. The different band sizes accommodate a huge range of sizes, but I bought a separate elastic band because the standard ones aren't very comfortable for long-term wear and may cause irritation after a while, especially if you're sweating or washing your hands a lot.",

        "review": "I mainly bought this fitbit to monitor my nightly sleep quality, although the overall health monitoring is a plus. 4 sleep stages are monitored: Deep, Light, REM, and Awake. Since it's all monitored at the wrist, the accuracy is unknown; however, the desired 10-20% of deep sleep (of the total) appears to be attained. Also, patterns can be seen, such as decreasing deep sleep if caffeine has been ingested. For O2, it only measures average variance; I wish it would give absolute reading over time like an SPO2 monitor that can be shown on a time chart. Also, the data can be downloaded to local computer, but it is tedious to use for a charting app, and is separated into various folders. It appears that only the fitbit app can use the data easily. It also monitors steps automatically, and exercise (start/stop manually). Other things are monitored, like cardio load, daily exercise, active zone, burned energy, etc. Weight can be input automatically with another app sync. If food and water monitoring is desired, it must be manually input.",

        "review": "I've had various Fitbit products over the years, and have really liked them, and Fitbit customer service has been great to me.  This is an upgrade from my Charge 2.  The other watch I considered was the Apple 4 (or now 5), but it's twice the price at $399.  The Apple had a EKG (really ECG) that I liked, but was not sure it would be too helpful for me.  And the Fitbit has sleep tracking a feature that the Apple Watch does not come with.  And the battery life on the Fitbit Versa 2 is a lot better with 4-5 days vs. Apple's less than one day (18 hours).The screen is beautiful, a HUGE upgrade.  Lots of clock choices.  There is an always on screen, but I chose to keep it off for now, it uses more power, and it's a very basic black and white, simple screen.  And not sure I always want the screen on, there are times like in a theater or in a dark room where it would be distracting.  A big plus is you can turn auto screen off at night, so it does not come one when you move in your sleep.  A very useful feature, that should save some battery life too.I needed to call customer service as I was having problems getting it added on my Fitbit app.  Since the watch is brand new (released September 15), it needs the latest Fitbit app for it to work.  After that was fixed, there was a bluetooth issue, but after turning it off and on, we were in business.A wonderful upgrade for me.EDIT:  I want to add, the watch bands are so much better than previous one's I've used on Fitbit watches.  I'm guessing they are no different than those on the previous Versa, but they are so much easier to use than those on the Charge 2.  (and I think they will last longer, I had problems with my Charge 2 bands breaking.)",

        "review": "Love the watch.  The size is perfect.  The screen/resolution is crystal clear.  The selection of bands is great (though changing bands is a bit challenging).  The fabric band that comes with the Special Edition version is great.  Classes it up a fit.  Have also ordered a sport band to wear while playing soccer, swimming, etc.  The device includes nearly all desired features needed for a fitness/smart watch.  It does not have built-in GPS but rather uses connected GPS.  Some may see this as a deal breaker; others will recognize the battery savings that this affords.  And so far, the watch performance has been excellent.There are some reviews that describe Versa failure after getting it wet.  I have successfully showered with the watch with no problem.  I have not yet had a chance to try it in the pool.  Based on the specs it should be fine, but time will tell.  The Versa is not recommended to be worn in hot tubs.As Fitbit has long been a leader in activity tracking, I won\u2019t spend time on those features.  Compared to the Samsung watch that I\u2019ve worn \u2026 step counting, heart rate info, calories and sleep tracking all seem to be in line with my historical measurements.  A big benefit is that the Fitbit app is much more robust then the Samsung health app with significantly more data to analyze.The watch software and the battery consumption on both watch and linked phone need some attention.  I\u2019m still trying to determine the optimal settings to achieve a balance of desired performance versus battery life.  With current settings, I can average about 3 days before needing to charge give or take a half day depending on usage.  I\u2019m currently using the always on display which is nice.  It does consume some battery, but so far has not been too heavy of a drain to make the feature unusable.If you choose to use the music app to control music playing on the phone, then expect a massive battery hit.  This functionality requires linking an additional bluetooth connection called Fitbit classic.  It\u2019s my experience that this connection continuously drains the battery on both the watch and the phone -- as much as 20% while sleeping.  That is with the watch in sleep mode and the phone on do not disturb.  I have removed this connection and will control music the old-fashioned way.  Note that this applies ONLY to playing music on the phone and not to connecting to bluetooth earphones.Another setting offered in the Fitbit app is \u201cAll-Day Sync.\u201d  This feature constantly updates the data -- activity, heart rate, etc. -- from the watch to the phone.  Sounds good, but it also is a battery hog and I have it disabled.  As far as I know, syncing can be done one of two ways -- either via the all-day setting or manually when you open the app.  I\u2019m currently choosing to update manually.  The developers need to add an option so the devices can be set to sync on a user-defined interval -- hourly, every six hours, daily, etc.  A setting like this exists for nearly every other phone app that requires data to be synced.  Weather apps are the first that come to mind.I am a Samsung user -- Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Buds (wireless earphones).  I can tell you that the Galaxy Buds will not work with the Versa 2 watch (as of 11/26/2019).  The Buds will link, but they will not play audio.  Something to do with different types of bluetooth used in the devices.  The issue is discussed in several online forums, but no word from Fitbit or Samsung if it will ever be addressed or fixed.  The watch does pair to the S10 without issue and works perfectly well.  All notifications are received timely and the bluetooth connection is much better/stronger than with my previous Samsung watch.  It easily stays connected at 30-40 feet.There are a couple of issues that need to be addressed related to phone notifications on the watch.  First, Gmail is the only client that is available as the \"default\" mail application.  Or, at least it is in my Fitbit app.  I can select to be notified by other email apps from my phone, but Gmail is the only app that can be set to receive \"special\" notification treatment according to the Fitbit app.  Secondly, alarms on the phone (and I use quite a few) are NOT available to notify on the Versa.  This feature would be a big plus to me.  You can set 8 alarms on the Versa.  However, each alarm uses some battery, and I would simply be duplicating alarms on multiple devices.  For example, I would not remove an alarm from my phone as I may need it while the watch is charging or not being worn.To correct other reviews that I've seen, music CAN be uploaded and stored on the watch.  The process requires using the desktop app and is a bit slow, but it works.  IF I had wireless headphones that connected properly, then I could play music direct from the Versa without the phone.One other small issue is that weather info does not exist on the clock face by default.  Third party clock faces can be installed, but I\u2019ve found that they often require a separate setting for weather updates, which then only work if the All-Day Sync option is enabled.  I\u2019m continuing to search for alternatives to see what options exist.There are quite a few apps available for download and use on the watch.  I haven't found any to be all that relevant or helpful to me.  At least not yet.  But the platform and functionality are there to use if desired.Also, I need to mention that the Alexa integration is great.  We have a heavy investment in Echo devices in our household, so to have the same functionality on my wrist is a great bonus.If, like me, you are apple averse, then this is one of the best smart watches available that I have found.  And very affordable.  At this point, I would rate it 8 out of 10.  And I would certainly increase that rating with continued additions to and improvement in the software, connectivity and watch features.**UPDATE 12/9/2019**Fitbit released a firmware update a few days ago which added some great features.  The Versa now saves your 5 most recently used clock faces and you can change them on the fly without having to go to the app.  Though there are tons of clock faces to choose from, one of the drawbacks with Fitbit is that you cannot flag, save or otherwise have access to your favorite faces.  You have to keep a manual list of the names or just remember so that you can find them again.  There needs to be a way to store a list of favorite faces and apps so that you can access and install them quickly.Other updates include that you can now customize the action of the side button, the sleep score is displayed on the watch, the list of exercises to choose from has expanded, and by reports the heart rate data has been improved.So I've learned that one of the tricks to manage battery life and connectivity is to restart the watch after making certain changes, such as switching to a new clock face.  You may notice that the Versa stops sending notifications or is not syncing to the app.  I've found that after a quick restart, the watch works perfectly again.  Maybe it's a software glitch, but at least there is an easy workaround.  And if you leave the watch alone, then these issues should not occur.For full functionality of the watch, including some features of many clock faces, I have re-enabled the All-Day Sync setting.  The watch and app perform much better with the setting enabled.  And unless I receive a ton of notifications or am constantly playing with the settings, I am now getting 4 to 5 days of battery life which is great.  This could also very well have something to do with the recent software update.  I am not currently using the always on display.  I estimate that AOD cuts the battery life by 30 to 50 percent.Also, before you make a decision with the help of reading these spectacular reviews, you might gauge the quality of the reviews.  This watch is by no means perfect and may not be the best choice for you, but you should decide that for yourself.  Then return it if you're not satisfied.  This is an electronic device and there can be duds.  Some buyers have expressed frustration after receiving a device that was dead on arrival.  Completely understandable.But there are many 1-star reviews that are not from a literate source.  A two word review that reads \"hate it\" is not helpful.  One review reads only \"no fitbit pay\" which is completely untrue.  The Versa absolutely has Fitbit Pay.  Also, I'm intrigued that apple phone users don't just pair their phone with an apple watch.  Not sure why they are shocked that the Versa does not work as seamlessly for them as a product designed by their phone maker.  Bottom line ... be your own judge.As referenced in my original review, I have updated my rating of the Versa 2 to a 9 out of 10, based on performance and recent software updates.  Hopefully my positive experience will continue.",

        "review": "I use this in my every day life now that I own it, it helps me manage my phone calls and texts really well.As for the fitness aspect of it, it's decent, but lacking in a lot of aspects as well. The step tracking is nearly completely inaccurate: turning in my sleep after midnight counts steps for the next day, I can wake up with up to 200 steps already taken, and trust me, that's not sleepwalking. Not only that, but when I go through a particularly intense car ride (my coworker... loves to hit well over the speed limit sometimes. And in alaska, you get ice heaves in the road, which can make for a VERY bumpy ride.) I end up with my daily stairs count going up.The sleep tracking could be better, it's based on heart rate so you have to really go under for it to start tracking, which might mean a few minutes of sleep are shaved off as you get to homeostasis.The battery is exactly as advertised so far, it lasts about 3-4 days before I recharge it, and could probably go at least a little bit longer than that depending on use.My main complaint is Alexa: she's totally useless trapped in this tiny little watch. \"Set a timer for 10 minutes\" \"I'm afraid I can't do that Dave\" \"Why not\" \"Please stop screaming at me\" the conversations go on, but nothing ever gets done with Alexa, she's just kind of *there* for when you want to force it to shut off by pressing the button for a long time.TL;DR Good for recording a basic outline of how active you really are in your day, exercise and sleep tracking are decent but wonky and more inaccurate as you go on, and Alexa is useless go get an echo or something if you want a useful Alexa device.",

        "review": "I stopped using my Fitbit just last week & I've never been more happy.For a company to continue to churn out more expensive & feature-laden \"activity\" watches throughout the years, it's almost unfathomable why it would degrade its user experience year after year.It has been a love/hate relationship ever since I bought the original Versa (after upgrading from a Charge given to me by a friend, & up until then I thought Fitbits were useless, trendy gadgets) because when the watch & app/software work, it's a very useful tool with a lot of data & information to help keep a person motivated & track their progress... but the inconsistency of the heart rate monitor, problems with syncing, app updates that are forced upon users otherwise their watch stops working with the app, non-existent customer service and/or totally inefficient customer care made life with a Fitbit one of frustration.Due to these factors & probably more, I vowed to myself to never spend another dime on a terrible company like Fitbit...but my Versa died in early 2020 (with an almost offensive lack of customer support to try & help) & I read some good things about the Samsung Galaxy activity watch so I switched & started using that, but with a terrible app & an even worse heart rate monitor & active time logger I broke my vow & purchased this Vera Lite.Even worse than the Versa, the heart rate monitor & problems with syncing on the Versa Lite I soldiered on because the app data & statistics are very helpful even if there are some discrepancies.But the final straw & what made me finally jump ship was the firmware upgrade pushed out late September/early October, as I had seen multiple complaints on the new \"zone minutes\" by beta testers posted on Fitbit's forum... yet Fitbit still forced this upgrade out to its user base, and as soon is it went out to, I'm assuming, thousands of users, the forum was flooded with average users confused & angry & wanting the old \"activity minutes\" back instead of this new \"zone minutes\" garbage.Not to mention all the complaints about their Fitbits not syncing anymore, getting bricked & staying on the Fitbit startup logo, not turning on at all, Fitbit \"updating\" their list of compatible phones so that users having problems now after the upgrade were officially SOL despite their watch & phone being compatible before... this all made me very scared so I dismissed the upgrade as long as I could (maybe 10-12 days), closing out the banner at the top of the app EVERY single time I opened it or refreshed the screen, but of course, after so many days my watch stopped syncing with my Samsung Ultra+ (& also my old Samsung S8, which I always used as a backup to sync with when the Fitbit was being temperamental with my Ultra+) & I had no choice but to upgrade the firmware.And exactly what you'd expect to happen did in fact happen: my watch wouldn't sync with either of my phones at all anymore...& I wound following the god-awful advice that is copy & pasted on Fitbit's forums for almost every single issue a user has, which is a long list of absolutely inconvenient & obtuse set of instructions that seem more long-winded & complex than dismantling an atomic bomb.I did the first couple of steps, anyway... & then my phone never was able to re-sync with the Fitbit & I gave up...I downloaded a step-tracker because I have my phone in my pocket 95% of the time anyway, it seems quite accurate, & MyFitnessPal gives the option to add exercises with caloric expenditure calculated for you already & now I'm finally free.",

I don't have a lot of needs, but I need them all met, and based on the spec sheet and advertised featureset this should cover everything.What I liked about this device:- Long battery life- Lightweight- Gets all my app notifications- Fitness trackingWhat the marketing material doesn't say:- Setup is a nightmare. The device ships with a firmware version that needs to be plugged into a PC in order to be able to update itself to a firmware version that can update OTA; except Windows 10 doesn't recognize the device when plugged in and Fitbit doesn't have drivers available on their website. Then once you get the device updated, there's still a slew of connectivity issues getting the device to pair properly with your phone.- The app notifications are inconsistent at best. There aren't many apps I actually want notifications from, but the few I do want I need them consistently. Sometimes they come through and everything is great, and other times they don't come at all and the troubleshooting steps to fix them is to reinstall the Fitbit software, reconfigure the device (and all of its settings), and restart both my phone and the watch.Here's the kicker: these are problems occurring in the first 24 hours! I haven't even had the device for a full day yet and I'm having all these problems. My last smartwatch, an LG G Watch R, was made in 2014 and didn't have any of these problems. It's 2020 Fitbit, this level of inadequacy is unacceptable.This device is a sleek and stylish fitness tracker, and does those tasks well enough, but if that was all I wanted there are better devices (even better Fitbit devices) that do that job. I bought the Versa Lite because I needed app notifications, and having to reconfigure the device daily isn't going to work out for me.I'm giving this a few more days to see if things stabilize before I return it.---EDIT: I've owned this for a week. The setup process is a nightmare because it ships with a buggy version of the firmware, and there's no way to force or sideload the update. You just have to wait DAYS until the device finally decides to update. After the update, many of the problems went away.Coincidentally, I got myself a new phone about a day after I got the update and once I paired the FitBit to my new phone things that never worked on my old phone suddenly worked on the new one.Pre-update + old phone: 2/5 starsPost-update + old phone: 3/5 starsPost-update + new phone: 4/5 starsI'll be updating my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars because once it's fully updated it's everything I wanted from it, but the horrible out-of-the-box experience cannot be overlooked.

        "review": "Had the Charge 2 for a while and loved it. Then switched to the latest apple watch at the encouragement of a few friends. While that apple watch was nice for the few months I wore it, I found I was not using a lot of the features in it that may have been why it was double the cost of the Versa. On the apple watch I found the battery would not last more than 36 hours and the phone app was no where near what Fitbit had in terms of activity and sleep tracking as well as just overall display of the many data points.When the Versa came out I said why not try it, hearing how slim it was and the extended battery life. It was that or go back to my Charge 2 that is also a fantastic tracker. My goal was to get back to the Fitbit app. I love this watch/fitness tracker and know this is going to be a huge hit for Fitbit. The app I love is now back in my life for the detailed activity and sleep tracker and the battery life is nearly as good as my Charge 2. I have gotten five days of battery life on the Fitbit Versa already - this is with a 45 minute workout on each of those five days included. At the end of the five days I was at 28% remaining, telling me I had another day or two of charge remaining. The texts all come through, the watch rings when I get a all on my iPhone, the screen is crystal clear, the watch itself is very slim compared to apple(no bump on the underside), there must be hundreds of clock faces to choose from, and it has all the apps I could think of needing in the watch store (the store is already noticeably growing). This is the fitness tracker\\watch to get. Very impressed and kudos to Fitbit for a well thought out fitness focused watch that is a true competitor to the apple watch.Just a quick comment on the setup of the Versa. I saw a few comments here about how the setup took 30 minutes or so to complete with an update. My comment is so what? I just put my Versa on the charger, used the app to update it, walked away, came back and wha-la - it was done! It hasn't stopped since!Enjoy!",

If I tried to make use of many apps on it then I could forget it lasting a whole day. It was nice to have Google assistant to control my smart home but unfortunately it quit taking a charge so I started looking for something new.I decided battery life was important for me as I couldn't use many of the \"smart\" features anyway on the Huawei due to battery life impact. And I wanted to have better fitness integration also.I decided to go with the Fitbit Versa and I am glad I did. It is well documented how well the battery life and fitness tracking work so I will not say more than it does a better job than I expected and I love the sleep tracking!I want to talk about the smart watch side of the Versa. Of course I wish I could talk to it and use Google assistant but I will give it up for battery life. I wanted to be able to control music and podcasts playback from my watch and was worried how this was going to work. All I had to do was go into settings and enable notifications from the apps I want to control and then I can start a play list or podcast on my phone. From the watch I only have swipe down, open the notification, and the controls are there! I used to build my own watchfaces on the Huawei watch with the \"watch maker\" app. I found a similar app in the fitbit app store called \"maker\". I haven't tried it yet as I am happy with the fitbit watch face I am using for now, but I am happy to the option is there for when I get bored and want to change things up later. It was nice being able to control my smartthings lights with the Google assistant on the Huawei but I can use my phone if needed and I have Alexa and Google home all over my house for that so it is less important. There is an app called \"switchr\" that will let me press buttons on my Versa to control them but I have not figured it out yet. That's my fault not the Versa as I have not used IFTTT much and I need to fix things on that end.Overall this is the perfect watch for me. It has all of the smarts that I care about. Of course Fitbit has the fitness part down as that's what they are known for. And I get the best of both worlds with great battery life. The Versa is small, lightweight, comfortable, and the best looking square watch In my opinion. I can't get over how thin the Versa is compared to other smart watches. It is thinner than some old dumb digital watches I have seen. Fitbit really got this one right!",

        "review": "UPDATE: 2 FULL YEARS later practically to the date. My SENSE crapped out. Was a good Smartwatch up until it just started not working (only showed fitbit icon, intermittent vibration, would work for a few hours, then go back to showing nothing. Was a quick death). Not changing rating as all these gadgets are basically throw aways. Now back to original review:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Probably want to select reviews based on \"most recent\" as that will provide you with most up to date and relevant information pertaining to this product. I acquired my Fitbit Sense in June 2021, it has not yet been a month, but so far so good with 24/7 use. I am slow to check out and use all the features, but what I have interacted with so far has been stellar.I have been using Fitbit products since April 2015- kinda have a love/hate relationship with this brand. I use the activity tracker constantly, and I greatly enjoy the app. So I have stuck with it as I upgraded over the years (Charge x2, Blaze x2, Versa 2, and now Sense). As with many Fitbit users, there is a known frustration with the products. Despite some of my own qualms, and having the ability to spend whatever I want on any fitness tracker I want, I still end up (so far) with this brand. Mostly because I haven't found a tracker and app that I totally like better. I even have a Garmin, but I find that so far off base of accuracy (save for HR), that it is a glorified watch. Garmin seems to do best for actual intended activities (going for a run, going for a long walk, going cycling) where it seems to not be accurate in steps for any other part of the day (only counts about 1/3 of actual steps unless engaged in a longer duration activity, and even then it takes a few minutes for it to start). Also, the app seems to have a lot of info, but doent really tell me anything. That being said, when it was time for me to buy another fitness tracker--I went from Versa 2 to Garmin.. back to Fitbit. I went with the Sense because the price was right, and it was an upgrade over the Versa 2.  After my underwhelming experience with the Garmin, I would have happily taken over a 2nd hand Charge from 2015. At least my steps would be accurate.Ok, so back to the Sense. WOW, the visual on the screen is really clear and precise. Even way more so over the Versa 2, and I had no issues with that. Set up was EASY, and QUICK.  Basically, just like in adding any other fitbit, just let it pair and it will very quickly be all set and ready to go. I didnt have any weird upselling offerings, or at least nothing that wasn't fantastically easy to opt out from. Nothing shady that I saw.ONE POINT that I DO think is important to know is that if you happen to have a Versa 2 (Not sure if this also happens with regular Versa, Versa Lite, or Versa 3), but this could not be added alongside my Versa 2. I had to take the Versa 2 offline in order to add this Sense. I know this is the case with trying to add more than one of the same products, yet I have always been able to have several Fitbits paired no problem, as long as they were different models. SO, I guess the Fitbit app sees Sense and Versa 2 as the same. Not a big deal as my Versa 2 had essentially died after I wore it on a hot humid day and my sweat killed it (then I brought it back to life after putting it in a bag of rice for about a week, Then afterward the battery was never the same. It drained to nothing daily.. and I needed to not have to worry about daily charging.. hence my picking up a Garmin in the interim to see if I liked them enough to spring for a more fancy model--nope-- and ended up buying the Sense.)Hope it lasts. I love the look. The band is way better than the old pin style. Swapping out bands is so much quicker, easier, less need for super fine motor skills. LOVE the charger. It just sort of magnetizes to the fitbit. No need to clip in.SP02 wasn't the main feature I was drawn to, but in order to have accurate use it seems a special clock face is needed, and that clock face will drain battery quicker (from what I have read). That being said,Battery life has been excellent for me.Love being able to add other apps, and features.  Scrolling is easy, turning face on/off is not complicated.HEART RATE is accurate. I have tested it against my garmin, two blood pressure devices, and a doctors appointment. All saying the same.Also, I the voice assistant is great. You can choose GOOGLE Assistant, OR Alexa. This is why selecting most recent reviews on this sort of stuff is important, as the early release of Sense did not have Google Assistant, but would soon with an update. True, and they followed through as I have it.AT THIS TIME, I have ZERO issues, concerns with this Fitbit Sense. I will be back to update as I learn more, or if I have anything worth sharing that is bad. I keep up with my reviews as needed.",

Fitbit seems to be aware of this issue, but has not corrected it. Overall a great fitness watch, just some software kinks that haven\u2019t been solved.",

        "review": "Updated Review:I initially gave it a 4 Star rating but just changed it to 5 Stars. I was having difficulty with viewing the daily rating of my Oxygen while sleeping. Some times it would register, other times it would not. I finally discovered that it was measuring my O2 level all the time. The results does not show up right away as you have to wait for a short time to appear.It did show me an upward trend in my temperature, resting heart rate, temperature variability with a downward trend in my Heart Rate Variability (HRV) when I came down with a nasty cold. I could trace it to the date it started.Original Review:The watch is pretty stylish. Comparing it to my sister's huge Samsung watch, this watch is sleeker and filled with more health features than hers.For accuracy, it is pretty good, but not perfect. I walked exactly 100 steps by counting them out, and the Sense showed 102. I'm pretty impressed with that. The sleep feature seems accurate when it measures the time fell asleep until the time I woke up. Even though it may not be totally accurate against more accurate medical-grade devices, it does give me a baseline and I can measure my progress from that. The heartbeat rate is pretty much on target but I haven\u2019t tested it above 120 where some people have issues with it being accurate.What I find inaccurate: 1) the stairs counter. It misses counting about 4 out of 5 times. If I go down the stairs to the main floor and then back up again, I count 32 steps. 2) I find the SpO2 function pretty useless. First, it is not anywhere close when compared with two actual SpO2 devices. Secondly, sometimes it records while sleeping and other nights it fails to record for no known reason. There are a number of similar complaints and frustration on the Fitbit forum about this same problem. Also, you must use their clock face to record, which I find inconvenient. So, if you are thinking about getting this watch primarily for that feature, I would caution you.Other than that complaint, the watch is quite nice. The charging device is genius, you bring it near the watch, and it instantly connects. Charging times are very short, so that's a big plus. If you use it to record your sleep and then throughout the day, you might get 2 to 3 days between charges.Nice to have the texting and phone calls feature. Sometimes when I have my phone on vibrate only, I miss the call, but now with the Sense, I feel the vibration on my wrist notifying me of who it is. I can read a partial window of the text message too. When my phone is not on vibrate, I can text the person back through the voice feature. I can answer the call and talk to them through my watch; however, you have to hold the phone near your ear to hear them as the speaker is pretty weak.There is a learning curve if you are a first-time Fitbit user. This is true with the watch and with the App. The App is filled with many graphs and features. It will take some time to learn where they all are located, but eventually you will be able to navigate and find them. Speaking of navigation, if you swipe down on the watch to delve deeper into an app, you can swipe back up, but you cannot go back to the previous feature or forward to the next. You must press the button to go back home first where you must start your navigation over. I hope Fitbit improves upon this feature in the future.The silicone watch band was quite difficult to clasp and unclasp. It wasn't the most comfortable either, possibly because my wrist was in between the sizing holes. The nice feature of the band is that it only takes a couple of seconds to change them out. I purchased a nice elastic one-piece band that allows me to take the watch off and put it back on within 2 to 3 seconds. Here is the Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KFFSHBH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1 and there are two sizes. I do recommend this band as it comes in a variety of colors and patterns.So, in conclusion, would I recommend this watch? I would say yes as long as you are not needing it for the SpO2 feature which I find unreliable.",

I bought one refurbished because it said it was an excellent condition and I didn\u2019t want to spend a bunch of money on a brand  new one again!! Within a year it will not hold a charge. It will say it\u2019s 100% charge. I\u2019ll put it on and as soon as I Exercise within 40 minutes it\u2019s completely dead. I have called two different representatives on hold forever. They said there\u2019s nothing they can do because the first person that purchased it bought it in 2020 or 2021 and the warranty is gone. I didn\u2019t even buy it until 2024 of January and it already broke by the time it was January 2025. so. It said nothing about an expiredcwatranty when I bought the watch. Normally, I always buy brand new but I did not want to spend top dollar on something that I knew would break anyway. I pleaded with them to replae it or be able to buy one for half price or 75% off if they did not replace it for free. All they offered was a 35% off coupon and that is not acceptable. I\u2019m very disappointed. I loved wearing a Fitbit when I exercise. It was a part of my being and I\u2019m pretty distraught because I don\u2019t wanna just keep buying them if they\u2019re going to keep breaking.",

The display is just stunning and so pleasing to look at. So far, the battery life has been incredible. It came at around 56% when I first turned it on, and is at 51% now 24 hours later. The step tracking, heart rate monitor,  and calories burned seems to be good so far, and are all very convenient features to be able to see so easily and quickly. I have not yet used the sleep tracking function yet. I really like being able to see texts, calls, and the time without needing to carry my phone with me everywhere I go, especially at work when I'm frequently moving around but need to watch the time closely. Pairing the Fitbit with my phone was seamless and fast. Also, the watch just looks so pretty and compliments any outfit well. Even just wearing the watch has motivated me to get more movement in. I'm not sure if I will try to go swimming with this watch any time soon, just in case. Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. I will try to provide an update in the future to see if the watch continues to hold up and be as good as it seems now.",

It's too wide and the silicone has to be squished for there to even be a chance to get it on the watch.  I did have another band from a previous Fitbit that worked perfectly.And also the battery doesn't last as sling as I'd like.  Fully changed to 90% after using the workout function for 35 minutes.  And then drains slightly throughout the day.  I have to charge it every few days or so.  My other Fitbit would last over a week on a charge.

The Very Fit app was easy to set up and I was using the watch quickly. Customer service was friendly and helpful. I haven't had any issues but they helped with the registration, warranty and a free gift. I like that the app makes learning the features of the watch and app a game that earns you \"coins\" every time you complete a new task. The coins allow you to access other faces or breathing techniques, etc. And the price was very reasonable for a smartwatch. Very happy with my purchase.",

        "review": "I've had various Fitbit products over the years, and have really liked them, and Fitbit customer service has been great to me.  This is an upgrade from my Charge 2.  The other watch I considered was the Apple 4 (or now 5), but it's twice the price at $399.  The Apple had a EKG (really ECG) that I liked, but was not sure it would be too helpful for me.  And the Fitbit has sleep tracking a feature that the Apple Watch does not come with.  And the battery life on the Fitbit Versa 2 is a lot better with 4-5 days vs. Apple's less than one day (18 hours).The screen is beautiful, a HUGE upgrade.  Lots of clock choices.  There is an always on screen, but I chose to keep it off for now, it uses more power, and it's a very basic black and white, simple screen.  And not sure I always want the screen on, there are times like in a theater or in a dark room where it would be distracting.  A big plus is you can turn auto screen off at night, so it does not come one when you move in your sleep.  A very useful feature, that should save some battery life too.I needed to call customer service as I was having problems getting it added on my Fitbit app.  Since the watch is brand new (released September 15), it needs the latest Fitbit app for it to work.  After that was fixed, there was a bluetooth issue, but after turning it off and on, we were in business.A wonderful upgrade for me.EDIT:  I want to add, the watch bands are so much better than previous one's I've used on Fitbit watches.  I'm guessing they are no different than those on the previous Versa, but they are so much easier to use than those on the Charge 2.  (and I think they will last longer, I had problems with my Charge 2 bands breaking.)",

        "review": "Love the watch.  The size is perfect.  The screen/resolution is crystal clear.  The selection of bands is great (though changing bands is a bit challenging).  The fabric band that comes with the Special Edition version is great.  Classes it up a fit.  Have also ordered a sport band to wear while playing soccer, swimming, etc.  The device includes nearly all desired features needed for a fitness/smart watch.  It does not have built-in GPS but rather uses connected GPS.  Some may see this as a deal breaker; others will recognize the battery savings that this affords.  And so far, the watch performance has been excellent.There are some reviews that describe Versa failure after getting it wet.  I have successfully showered with the watch with no problem.  I have not yet had a chance to try it in the pool.  Based on the specs it should be fine, but time will tell.  The Versa is not recommended to be worn in hot tubs.As Fitbit has long been a leader in activity tracking, I won\u2019t spend time on those features.  Compared to the Samsung watch that I\u2019ve worn \u2026 step counting, heart rate info, calories and sleep tracking all seem to be in line with my historical measurements.  A big benefit is that the Fitbit app is much more robust then the Samsung health app with significantly more data to analyze.The watch software and the battery consumption on both watch and linked phone need some attention.  I\u2019m still trying to determine the optimal settings to achieve a balance of desired performance versus battery life.  With current settings, I can average about 3 days before needing to charge give or take a half day depending on usage.  I\u2019m currently using the always on display which is nice.  It does consume some battery, but so far has not been too heavy of a drain to make the feature unusable.If you choose to use the music app to control music playing on the phone, then expect a massive battery hit.  This functionality requires linking an additional bluetooth connection called Fitbit classic.  It\u2019s my experience that this connection continuously drains the battery on both the watch and the phone -- as much as 20% while sleeping.  That is with the watch in sleep mode and the phone on do not disturb.  I have removed this connection and will control music the old-fashioned way.  Note that this applies ONLY to playing music on the phone and not to connecting to bluetooth earphones.Another setting offered in the Fitbit app is \u201cAll-Day Sync.\u201d  This feature constantly updates the data -- activity, heart rate, etc. -- from the watch to the phone.  Sounds good, but it also is a battery hog and I have it disabled.  As far as I know, syncing can be done one of two ways -- either via the all-day setting or manually when you open the app.  I\u2019m currently choosing to update manually.  The developers need to add an option so the devices can be set to sync on a user-defined interval -- hourly, every six hours, daily, etc.  A setting like this exists for nearly every other phone app that requires data to be synced.  Weather apps are the first that come to mind.I am a Samsung user -- Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Buds (wireless earphones).  I can tell you that the Galaxy Buds will not work with the Versa 2 watch (as of 11/26/2019).  The Buds will link, but they will not play audio.  Something to do with different types of bluetooth used in the devices.  The issue is discussed in several online forums, but no word from Fitbit or Samsung if it will ever be addressed or fixed.  The watch does pair to the S10 without issue and works perfectly well.  All notifications are received timely and the bluetooth connection is much better/stronger than with my previous Samsung watch.  It easily stays connected at 30-40 feet.There are a couple of issues that need to be addressed related to phone notifications on the watch.  First, Gmail is the only client that is available as the \"default\" mail application.  Or, at least it is in my Fitbit app.  I can select to be notified by other email apps from my phone, but Gmail is the only app that can be set to receive \"special\" notification treatment according to the Fitbit app.  Secondly, alarms on the phone (and I use quite a few) are NOT available to notify on the Versa.  This feature would be a big plus to me.  You can set 8 alarms on the Versa.  However, each alarm uses some battery, and I would simply be duplicating alarms on multiple devices.  For example, I would not remove an alarm from my phone as I may need it while the watch is charging or not being worn.To correct other reviews that I've seen, music CAN be uploaded and stored on the watch.  The process requires using the desktop app and is a bit slow, but it works.  IF I had wireless headphones that connected properly, then I could play music direct from the Versa without the phone.One other small issue is that weather info does not exist on the clock face by default.  Third party clock faces can be installed, but I\u2019ve found that they often require a separate setting for weather updates, which then only work if the All-Day Sync option is enabled.  I\u2019m continuing to search for alternatives to see what options exist.There are quite a few apps available for download and use on the watch.  I haven't found any to be all that relevant or helpful to me.  At least not yet.  But the platform and functionality are there to use if desired.Also, I need to mention that the Alexa integration is great.  We have a heavy investment in Echo devices in our household, so to have the same functionality on my wrist is a great bonus.If, like me, you are apple averse, then this is one of the best smart watches available that I have found.  And very affordable.  At this point, I would rate it 8 out of 10.  And I would certainly increase that rating with continued additions to and improvement in the software, connectivity and watch features.**UPDATE 12/9/2019**Fitbit released a firmware update a few days ago which added some great features.  The Versa now saves your 5 most recently used clock faces and you can change them on the fly without having to go to the app.  Though there are tons of clock faces to choose from, one of the drawbacks with Fitbit is that you cannot flag, save or otherwise have access to your favorite faces.  You have to keep a manual list of the names or just remember so that you can find them again.  There needs to be a way to store a list of favorite faces and apps so that you can access and install them quickly.Other updates include that you can now customize the action of the side button, the sleep score is displayed on the watch, the list of exercises to choose from has expanded, and by reports the heart rate data has been improved.So I've learned that one of the tricks to manage battery life and connectivity is to restart the watch after making certain changes, such as switching to a new clock face.  You may notice that the Versa stops sending notifications or is not syncing to the app.  I've found that after a quick restart, the watch works perfectly again.  Maybe it's a software glitch, but at least there is an easy workaround.  And if you leave the watch alone, then these issues should not occur.For full functionality of the watch, including some features of many clock faces, I have re-enabled the All-Day Sync setting.  The watch and app perform much better with the setting enabled.  And unless I receive a ton of notifications or am constantly playing with the settings, I am now getting 4 to 5 days of battery life which is great.  This could also very well have something to do with the recent software update.  I am not currently using the always on display.  I estimate that AOD cuts the battery life by 30 to 50 percent.Also, before you make a decision with the help of reading these spectacular reviews, you might gauge the quality of the reviews.  This watch is by no means perfect and may not be the best choice for you, but you should decide that for yourself.  Then return it if you're not satisfied.  This is an electronic device and there can be duds.  Some buyers have expressed frustration after receiving a device that was dead on arrival.  Completely understandable.But there are many 1-star reviews that are not from a literate source.  A two word review that reads \"hate it\" is not helpful.  One review reads only \"no fitbit pay\" which is completely untrue.  The Versa absolutely has Fitbit Pay.  Also, I'm intrigued that apple phone users don't just pair their phone with an apple watch.  Not sure why they are shocked that the Versa does not work as seamlessly for them as a product designed by their phone maker.  Bottom line ... be your own judge.As referenced in my original review, I have updated my rating of the Versa 2 to a 9 out of 10, based on performance and recent software updates.  Hopefully my positive experience will continue.",

        "review": "I use this in my every day life now that I own it, it helps me manage my phone calls and texts really well.As for the fitness aspect of it, it's decent, but lacking in a lot of aspects as well. The step tracking is nearly completely inaccurate: turning in my sleep after midnight counts steps for the next day, I can wake up with up to 200 steps already taken, and trust me, that's not sleepwalking. Not only that, but when I go through a particularly intense car ride (my coworker... loves to hit well over the speed limit sometimes. And in alaska, you get ice heaves in the road, which can make for a VERY bumpy ride.) I end up with my daily stairs count going up.The sleep tracking could be better, it's based on heart rate so you have to really go under for it to start tracking, which might mean a few minutes of sleep are shaved off as you get to homeostasis.The battery is exactly as advertised so far, it lasts about 3-4 days before I recharge it, and could probably go at least a little bit longer than that depending on use.My main complaint is Alexa: she's totally useless trapped in this tiny little watch. \"Set a timer for 10 minutes\" \"I'm afraid I can't do that Dave\" \"Why not\" \"Please stop screaming at me\" the conversations go on, but nothing ever gets done with Alexa, she's just kind of *there* for when you want to force it to shut off by pressing the button for a long time.TL;DR Good for recording a basic outline of how active you really are in your day, exercise and sleep tracking are decent but wonky and more inaccurate as you go on, and Alexa is useless go get an echo or something if you want a useful Alexa device.",

        "review": "This is a fantastic watch.  I've been a long-time Fossil smartwatch user.  My Fossil Gen 6 watch started acting up, and I recently learned that Fossil has exited smartwatches.  Once I switched to the Pixel 3, I was thrilled and do not miss my Gen 6 at all.  I should have switched sooner.My 2nd Fossil replacement alternative was the OnePlus 2.  The Pixel looked better (to me) and has Wear OS 5 which is the most recent version.  It was hard to decide between the two using online descriptions and reviews, but I am happy with my choice.  The Pixel battery life is better than the Fossil, even with the always on display, and easily gets me though the day.  The charge may not last as long as the OnePlus 2, but I do not wear it overnight and instead put the watch on the charger, so the extra battery life is not an issue for me.  Others may see this differently.The Pixel 3 screen is MUCH brighter and sharper than the Fossil, the processor is faster, and the watch operation is intuitive and easy to learn.  Activating the watch, setting it up, and switching from the Fossil was quick and easy since most of the apps and info are tied to my Google account.Long-time irritants with the Fossil were how the end of the watch band kept flopping loose from its holder band, and how the crown button constantly activated when I sharply bent my wrist.  The Pixel fixes both of these issues.  The Pixel watch band is a bit tricky to attach at first (YouTube helps), but it works MUCH better than the Fossil and is more comfortable.  The Pixel has a nice feature where you can rotate the watch display 180 degrees (make it upside down) so you can wear the crown button on the left side of the watch.  No more accidental app activations, restarts, or 911 calls!My primary watch use is for business to monitor emails and texts, and to see/screen/take phone calls.  All these work beautifully, and are handled much better than with the Fossil.  Even the weather app is upgraded in the new OS, and there is a timer that can be added to the tiles.  I use my watch secondarily for the health features, and I was sad (at first) to learn Google Fit would not be on the Pixel.  I used Fit on the Fossil to track steps and distance walked.  The new FitBit basic version is a true upgrade and gives me all the info I had before, plus a lot more.  I did not opt for the free Premium FitBit trial.I bought and recommend a set of the plastic watch covers for scratch and impact protection, and a charging stand.  Both work great.",

I\u2019m not saying Apple Watches are horrible but if you are looking for a quality watch for a reasonable price, this watch will do the job just fine. It looks pretty classy and modern. I like that it\u2019s round shaped, gives off a more glamorous vibe. Felt nice on my wrist too, not too bulky or tight. Doesn\u2019t make my wrist sweaty either. It\u2019s really a great buy in my opinion. Pleased with my purchase \u263a\ufe0f",

I switched the app to my Android phone and had a much better and easier experience.  The app is easy to use and the  health metrics are very nice.  It stays connected to my phone and and me when I need to sync the app to refresh the data which is good because I will forget. Answering calls by the watch is a nice feature and new to me.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the watch and enjoying how it looks and me helps with tracking my exercise and health.",

Even after all that loyalty, I couldn\u2019t justify spending another $200 on a new one.I started looking for alternatives and found this watch, and I\u2019m honestly more than impressed. It has all the features you\u2019d expect from a high-end smartwatch: heart rate tracking, music control, call and message notifications, email, app alerts\u2014you name it. But what I love most is that it also works perfectly for someone like me who just wants to see steps, workouts, and incoming calls.The battery lasts a full week (I\u2019ve only charged it once so far), and everything works smoothly.

        "review": "Had the Charge 2 for a while and loved it. Then switched to the latest apple watch at the encouragement of a few friends. While that apple watch was nice for the few months I wore it, I found I was not using a lot of the features in it that may have been why it was double the cost of the Versa. On the apple watch I found the battery would not last more than 36 hours and the phone app was no where near what Fitbit had in terms of activity and sleep tracking as well as just overall display of the many data points.When the Versa came out I said why not try it, hearing how slim it was and the extended battery life. It was that or go back to my Charge 2 that is also a fantastic tracker. My goal was to get back to the Fitbit app. I love this watch/fitness tracker and know this is going to be a huge hit for Fitbit. The app I love is now back in my life for the detailed activity and sleep tracker and the battery life is nearly as good as my Charge 2. I have gotten five days of battery life on the Fitbit Versa already - this is with a 45 minute workout on each of those five days included. At the end of the five days I was at 28% remaining, telling me I had another day or two of charge remaining. The texts all come through, the watch rings when I get a all on my iPhone, the screen is crystal clear, the watch itself is very slim compared to apple(no bump on the underside), there must be hundreds of clock faces to choose from, and it has all the apps I could think of needing in the watch store (the store is already noticeably growing). This is the fitness tracker\\watch to get. Very impressed and kudos to Fitbit for a well thought out fitness focused watch that is a true competitor to the apple watch.Just a quick comment on the setup of the Versa. I saw a few comments here about how the setup took 30 minutes or so to complete with an update. My comment is so what? I just put my Versa on the charger, used the app to update it, walked away, came back and wha-la - it was done! It hasn't stopped since!Enjoy!",

If I tried to make use of many apps on it then I could forget it lasting a whole day. It was nice to have Google assistant to control my smart home but unfortunately it quit taking a charge so I started looking for something new.I decided battery life was important for me as I couldn't use many of the \"smart\" features anyway on the Huawei due to battery life impact. And I wanted to have better fitness integration also.I decided to go with the Fitbit Versa and I am glad I did. It is well documented how well the battery life and fitness tracking work so I will not say more than it does a better job than I expected and I love the sleep tracking!I want to talk about the smart watch side of the Versa. Of course I wish I could talk to it and use Google assistant but I will give it up for battery life. I wanted to be able to control music and podcasts playback from my watch and was worried how this was going to work. All I had to do was go into settings and enable notifications from the apps I want to control and then I can start a play list or podcast on my phone. From the watch I only have swipe down, open the notification, and the controls are there! I used to build my own watchfaces on the Huawei watch with the \"watch maker\" app. I found a similar app in the fitbit app store called \"maker\". I haven't tried it yet as I am happy with the fitbit watch face I am using for now, but I am happy to the option is there for when I get bored and want to change things up later. It was nice being able to control my smartthings lights with the Google assistant on the Huawei but I can use my phone if needed and I have Alexa and Google home all over my house for that so it is less important. There is an app called \"switchr\" that will let me press buttons on my Versa to control them but I have not figured it out yet. That's my fault not the Versa as I have not used IFTTT much and I need to fix things on that end.Overall this is the perfect watch for me. It has all of the smarts that I care about. Of course Fitbit has the fitness part down as that's what they are known for. And I get the best of both worlds with great battery life. The Versa is small, lightweight, comfortable, and the best looking square watch In my opinion. I can't get over how thin the Versa is compared to other smart watches. It is thinner than some old dumb digital watches I have seen. Fitbit really got this one right!",

It took a couple of weeks for it to arrive, mainly due to the holiday season, but it has been worth it.  The battery life on it is much longer than what I previously had on Fitbit, and there are a lot of features available.  It will take a while to familiarize yourself with so many features, but once you do they will be worth it.  If you use it to monitor your workouts, as I do, there are many categories of workouts that it will evaluate, running, walking, strength workouts, biking, cardio, etc.  You get great data on your sleep patterns, morning reports, weather updates, etc.  What I enjoy is that when you download the Garmin app on your phone you can use your data from Garmin to enter into competitions with other Garmin members.  Fitbit, once bought out by Google, began to eliminate a lot of the groups and competitions you could be involved in, so Garmin was a breath of fresh air in this.  The band on the watch feels great and the watch looks stylish.  I am sure that there are a ton more features out there that I have not even gotten to yet, but my impressions on a Garmin smartwatch is that they are definitely worth the money if you enjoy using a smartwatch daily.",

        "review": "Four stars out of five - it does a lot of things very well, but lacks some features that I thought it had because of the description on the Garmin web page - most notable the inability to track respiration during workouts.  It does track respiration all day, so this must just be a software issue to get you to buy a more expensive version.  The watch faces are a little finicky to design, but there are a lot of them on the Connect IQ shop (some free, some not).I've worn an A brand watch that works seamlessly with my iPhone since they first came out.  I would say that that watch is an outstanding smart watch with a mediocre fitness tracker.  This Garmin Vivoactive 5 (they now have the 6 released) is an excellent fitness tracker with an average smart watch.  It pairs with the Garmin App and gives you much better granularity into your fitness metrics.  It has a solid battery life - my first test lasted six days before it went into low battery mode and I used it for about 12 hours of workouts (which is a battery drain).  The best feature for me is that it allows me to put all my workouts (including my cycling with a Garmin 1030)  into one location, Garmin Connect.Overall, it isn't a replacement for my smart watch, but it is a great entry level fitness tracker.  I'm planning on using it for several months to completely understand all the features, then I may try going for a high end Garmin watch as a replacement for my trusty A-watch.  For now, I am (ugh) wearing one watch on each arm.",

This is the primary reason that I wanted to try using a 3rd party app despite being an iPhone user. What I later discovered after my first workout has prompted me to return the watch for a much pricier Apple Watch SE 2. While the device seemed to have comparable heart rate readings to the treadmill I was using, the distance calculation was off. I have a short stride, so their default treadmill setting doesn\u2019t appear to work for me. I walked 2.5 miles, but the watch stated that my total distance was 2.83 miles. While this isn\u2019t a huge difference, I can see how it would add up on longer walks. There is also no way to edit the entry in the app to correct the information. In addition, my step counts seem to take time to add to Apple Health. The information from the VeryFit app appeared to be logged in Apple Health, but for some reason, the data was not being added to the total steps for today. It seems like there is some kind of lag, which isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but it is inconvenient to wait for everything to update.I wish this watch had worked out for me.

        "review": "I have to say that this is a pretty impressive smart watch for about 15% of the cost of my last smart watch. My last smart watch was unable to take blood pressure, but this one does and seems to do an ok job at it. I did buy a different band for$7 as the rubber one that was on the watch irritated me. I expected this as it was the same with my expensive smart watch. I did not expect that it would sink with my expensive smart phone. Again it does a pretty good job at that with most of the data being transferred directly into my Health app. It was definitely worth the money so far. I ran a 10K race and the times, pace and heart rate were all accurate. The app is not as smooth as my expensive watch, but it seems to work well enough. One of the biggest problems with my expensive watch is that I have broken 3 different watch faces over the past 10 years. I try to be gentle but at $400 per watch it hurts when I crack them being active, but I buy them to wear when I am active. I can wear this and not be worried about if I happen to break it while using it. The battery seems to last about 4 days which is 4 times longer than my expensive watch. I have been recommending them to everyone I can!  This is my favorite Amazon purchase of the past  12 months!",

        "review": "I ordered this watch to help track my fitness.  I wasn't expecting a ton for the price but it delivered a lot. I don't have much faith in the accuracy of the heart rate monitor. It tends to read slightly lower than the ones at the gym.  The step tracker seems to be off as well.  The watch has a treadmill setting but it calculates about a quarter mile short per mile consistently.  It has a blood pressure monitor, no idea how it calculates BP but it's way off.  I compared at the Dr the other day, my BP was 98/64 and the watch was reading 124/74.Those aren't really negatives.  I read reviews on watches that are 4 or 5 times as expensive and they have the same issues.  The pros are great for the price.  Can read incoming texts, notifications for emails, snapchat, Facebook messenger, and anything else you grant permission to.  Answer and make phone calls.  The screen is durable.  I've smashed it with weights, banged it off counters, door knobs, brick, and anything else my clumsy self could find and there isn't so much as a scratch.  Screen is easy to read and see. Tons of options for watch face display.  I've gone days without charging and it has never gone below 50%. It looks nice, gotten people asking if it was apple or galaxy.  Isn't big and bulky.  I like the black one and my wife got the peach cookies colored one.For the price it's definitely worth it if you're wanting to test drive a smart fit watch.",

The app is so easy to navigate.I am on a health kick and the fitness tracker and sleep tracker helps me tremendously to keep on track. Tracks your fitness and counts steps pretty accurately.The blood pressure monitor is useless - even after providing reference values, the readings do not track with real blood pressure - just gives same basic reading no matter what - not even useful to warn of extremes! BP monitor simply does not function - readout is meaningless.The call feature works well, the screen is bright, and the battery lasts several days.If you want a fitness watch that offers a lot of functionality, this is a good choice, especially for the price. If you want blood pressure readings, this, unfortunately, is not even close to the mark. Still got 5 stars since the CS are very supportive.",

Not bad!The only thing I would change is the ability to access text messages. As far as I can see you can only respond when you get a new one in, and can't start one. There is so much going on with this watch, I am sure I just missed it somehow!This says it will support ALEXA but as of this review it hasn't rolled out yet. Still great without it.The buttons on the side are a little bulky and get caught on things now and then. However, I really like using them as shortcuts! It has helped. The face watch is definitely big enough to swipe with no issues. And it's circular face still allows for plenty of screen.This is getting long but it is a really cool, high functioning watch.

I'm a bit of a computer and android geek, and the WearOS watches have always intrigued me, but I never felt like I really needed one. My #1 issue with the watch (and this is mainly WearOS) is that it still seems slightly under-baked. I know WearOS 3 is coming and all that, but WearOS 2 is quite good overall, and yet it reminds me of the earlier android days. So close, but not quite there yet.Setup was fast and easy, but the occasional annoying glitch (e.g. it disconnects from my phone almost every time I take the watch off when my phone is charging) keeps me from 100% enthusiastically recommending it to non-tech friendly friends/family.Stuff I love: workout tracking. This is probably the number 1 reason I bought the watch. I work out daily, and I love the tracking features of the watch. Blood oxygen is a nice added bonus to go with the workout tracking. Notifications & the ability to respond to messages from my watch--this is so nice when I'm out, and my phone is in my purse or pocket. Being able to ring my phone when I leave it somewhere in the house, and don't remember where.Did I mention that the watch itself is really nice looking?? I love that the Fossil looks like an actual watch and not some crappy plastic smartwatch. I have two bands for it -- the silicone one it came with, and I picked up the metal mesh band from Fossil, as well. Despite the Galaxy Watch 4's superior features (and WearOS 3), I never even considered it -- it looks too much like a smartwatch. I'm a Samsung phone owner, too.Stuff I don't love: the slightly buggy quirks. Sometimes the watch just refuses to connect to my phone. I can toggle the connection over and over in the WearOS app on my phone, and it still won't connect. Only rebooting the watch at that point will solve the problem. If you never take the watch off, you may never see this, but since I don't use sleep tracking (it creeps me out), I take it off at night and leave the watch to charge in a separate room from where I'm sleeping.Overall, this watch is a solid buy. I'm using it with a Samsung Z Flip 3 phone. 99% of the time, it functions flawlessly -- if they could iron out that 1% of quirks, I'd be recommending it to anyone and everyone.",

Does everything I want it to do.Update:I've had this watch for about four days now and found out a few things. LTE and WiFi use a god awful lot of battery. I ran multiple tests with the battery on this watch and think they would be beneficial to provide in a review.Test Results:\u2022 Battery Charging TimeThe watch was completely dead when I opened the box. Went from 0 to 50% in less than a half hour and finished it's charging in about another half hour. In total charging from 0 to 100% was about an hour.\u2022 Battery LifeWhen I had LTE and WiFi on, It used a whole lot more battery life than it did with it only when needed, or off. All of these battery tests were run from 5:30 AM to 5:30 PM. With LTE and WiFi on all day I was left with about 15 precent left. With LTE and WiFi on only when needed, I was left with about 40 precent left. With it off all day, (Only Bluetooth was on) I was left with 60 precent. When I ran these battery life tests, tilt to wake was off to save battery. Your personal results may vary depending on usage.* BATTERY TESTS END HERE *---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---  ---My Review:\u2022 QualityWatch feels very high quality. Came in a really well packaged box. Felt really nice to open.\u2022 PersonalizationYou are able to change out bands you buy aftermarket, or from the Google store. My recommendation is to buy aftermarket bands. Google's bands are overpriced. You are also able to change the watch face and color (depends on face) to your liking.\u2022 SetupSetup was very seamless. It was really just clicking buttons and agreeing to TOS and things like that. With eSim activation it was very seamless with Google Fi. If you use any other service providers. I don't know how that will work.\u2022 LTE Costs?With Google Fi, there is no extra cost to adding your watch to your plan. (Max. of 1 watch per user on plan) Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, and other mobile providers costs may vary. I recommend for you to create a customer service ticket before buying this watch with LTE if you use anything else other than Google Fi.\u2022 Emergency FeaturesWear OS 4 on the Pixel Watch includes fall detection, safety check, SOS, Medical Info Access, and Emergency Sharing for your safety and protection. For more information about what those features are, I recommend for you to visit the Google page for the Pixel Watch.\u2022 Apps FunctionalityApps are fairly smooth. Pixel Watch comes with a 6 months fitbit premium trial. Both apps setup is fairly smooth. Fitbit is also a part of health Connect for Pixel phones so it will link up with other fitness apps you have for your phone or watch.",

I've always been disappointed that Android users didn't have a really good smart watch option. But now we do! The Pixel Watch does everything I want it to do, plus it looks great and is very comfortable for my narrow wrists. I have had a few little hiccups, but I expected that since the device is so new. Google will continue to release software improvements, but it's certainly good enough right now.The battery is not ideal, but I can get by with charging once a day. It will charge ~30% quickly but it takes over an hour for a full charge. If you don't need a new smartwatch right now, it might be worth waiting for the second generation so they can improve the battery life.[This advice is posted Nov 2022 and may become outdated very quickly] For my diabetic friends: It is possible to get your Dexcom readings on the Pixel Watch, but it's not out-of-the-box. (That's Dexcom's fault and true for all Android watches). If you want to get your Dexcom readings on your watch, take some aspirin first, and then search Reddit for your options. There are multiple options but I had the best luck with an app called G-Watch Wear App. In the photo of my watchface, the Dexcom reading is the middle circle, and I also have the option to open more detailed info. When I had the apple watch my Dexcom data would fail to update but there was no way of knowing. On the G-Watch app, there is a little timestamp showing when it collected the data. Dexcom refreshes every 5 minutes, so if the timestamp is more than 5 minutes old you may want to check your phone for your most current reading.",

The display is just stunning and so pleasing to look at. So far, the battery life has been incredible. It came at around 56% when I first turned it on, and is at 51% now 24 hours later. The step tracking, heart rate monitor,  and calories burned seems to be good so far, and are all very convenient features to be able to see so easily and quickly. I have not yet used the sleep tracking function yet. I really like being able to see texts, calls, and the time without needing to carry my phone with me everywhere I go, especially at work when I'm frequently moving around but need to watch the time closely. Pairing the Fitbit with my phone was seamless and fast. Also, the watch just looks so pretty and compliments any outfit well. Even just wearing the watch has motivated me to get more movement in. I'm not sure if I will try to go swimming with this watch any time soon, just in case. Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. I will try to provide an update in the future to see if the watch continues to hold up and be as good as it seems now.",

It will say it\u2019s 100% charge. I\u2019ll put it on and as soon as I Exercise within 40 minutes it\u2019s completely dead. I have called two different representatives on hold forever. They said there\u2019s nothing they can do because the first person that purchased it bought it in 2020 or 2021 and the warranty is gone. I didn\u2019t even buy it until 2024 of January and it already broke by the time it was January 2025. so. It said nothing about an expiredcwatranty when I bought the watch. Normally, I always buy brand new but I did not want to spend top dollar on something that I knew would break anyway. I pleaded with them to replae it or be able to buy one for half price or 75% off if they did not replace it for free. All they offered was a 35% off coupon and that is not acceptable. I\u2019m very disappointed. I loved wearing a Fitbit when I exercise. It was a part of my being and I\u2019m pretty distraught because I don\u2019t wanna just keep buying them if they\u2019re going to keep breaking.",

The watch vibrated, the logo popped up, the NOTHING, again) I have returned this product to Amazon in hopes of receiving one that works.  If that happens I will post a new rating. I presently have a Versa 2 that has worked great. I was replacing it only because I know it's battery is starting to go (I've had it for over 3 years).. it needs charging more often, and I felt an upgrade would be nice. The sad part is that I received a Fitbit Charge 6 for Christmas and returned it because I wanted some additional features. I hope I receive a NEW Versa 4 this time.",

I had to charge the Versa2 everyday but it is an older one - I bought from Amazon in 2019 so I would say I got my moneys worth out of the Versa2.

The Very Fit app was easy to set up and I was using the watch quickly. Customer service was friendly and helpful. I haven't had any issues but they helped with the registration, warranty and a free gift. I like that the app makes learning the features of the watch and app a game that earns you \"coins\" every time you complete a new task. The coins allow you to access other faces or breathing techniques, etc. And the price was very reasonable for a smartwatch. Very happy with my purchase.",

I mainly wanted this hoping the sleep tracking would be more accurate than the sleep.com app I\u2019ve been using. The results on this watch are almost exact opposite of the app (almost too much deep sleep and REM on the watch, but not enough on the app). I don\u2019t necessarily feel the app is correct either, but it seems closer than this watch so far. In seven nights the watch has reported zero wake time during the night even though there\u2019s been at least a few nights where I know I was awake and tossing and turning for over a half hour. The app shows those wake times.I also feel like calorie count is way high. If I consumed the calories that the watch\u2019s app says I\u2019m burning (all-day calories) I\u2019d be gaining weight rapidly. Steps count seems all over the place. At times it\u2019s not counting steps at all, but other times it\u2019s counting steps when all I\u2019m doing is sitting on the couch.The watch face is very large. I have a fairly average wrist and it is as wide as my wrist, knocking on a table or counter if I rest my arm on it.Not sure if I will continue to use this or not. While having all the data is very interesting it\u2019s not really of any value if you can\u2019t count on it being at least somewhat accurate.",

I can't say how well it works with Alexa because to connect it to Alexa I have to use their app to open my amazon account, that is way to sketchy for me. Why would they need my amazon account information? You can easily connect devices to Alexa with Bluetooth, no need to access someones account.I'd had a cheap smart watch just like this one a few years back and was happy with it but it died. This watch is twice as thick / bulky as the one I had years ago. Most products get slimmer & cheaper with age, this watch is about the same price as my old watch but, well, it's as thick as my iphone12 with it's case on, maybe a bit thicker. I'm concerned I'm going to be bumping things or get caught on things. Think about it would you want something that huge on your arm?Not too sure about the HR monitor either, HR is variable, changing constantly. I have this set to continuous HR and the number stays the same, that's just NOT how the heart works.I just got it & hate sending things back so I'm going to try it out but so far I'm not impressed.",

I have noticed some lost step data when I try to go back days later but I am not convinced that is not user error.

It connected to my iPhone very quickly, and the app is easy to use. I can check messages, answer calls, and even control my music without taking out my phone. The step counter and heart rate monitor seem accurate, which helps me stay active. I like all the sports modes, even though I mostly use it for walking. The battery lasts several days. It\u2019s also waterproof, so I don\u2019t worry about sweat or rain. I was surprised how many features it has. Overall, it\u2019s a great buy if you want a smart and useful watch without spending too much.",

        "review": "I have order 4 of the Fitbit Sense 1 watches and had to return all of them.  This watch is obsolete likely due to Fitbit not updating it's software to operate correctly with legacy products.  There are many know problems with this watch and they are likely the reason Fitbit created the Sense 2.1) The button designed to pull you back to the home screen rarely works.2) The heart rate monitor is wildly inaccurate which leads to inaccurate measurements with exercise, sleep and the other cardio functions.The screen shots are of stairmaster sessions I had.  I wore a chest strap heart rate monitor and that device showed my heart rate moving from about 100 to 150 in a linear path.  At no point did my heart rate drop more than a few beats.  You can see the Fitbit charts depict an implausible scenario.  This has been the case with all 4 of the Sense watches I have had.I have followed suggestions found on the internet Appling water between the watch and my skin; wearing the watch tighter, looser, over the wrist and under the wrist.  None of these things make a difference.It's extremally likely that Fitbit is making software updates without ensuring that the updates are compatible with their legacy products.  This happens with most software companies and it appears to be the case here.If you are going to order a Fitbit product order the current model if you expect it to work as intended.  At a minimum, stay away from the Sense 1.",

I even spoke to the customer service at fitbit/google, who were honestly super nice and helpful in trouble shooting. Unfortunately, they confirmed that the watch was truly dead and, at 15 months, was beyond the 12 month warranty. So the best they would offer me was 30% off another product from their store.So buyer beware. It's a great watch, but you are paying for a VERY short-lived consumer product.",

I\u2019d recommend this over the Apple Watch, you can change faces for free and don\u2019t have to purchase extra apps. It just works out of the box and is a quality product. Cost a little but, but good things that last do. Comes with a charge cable, you\u2019ll need a wall plug with USB. But the best part days without needing a charge. Great battery life.

        "review": "I upgraded to the Fitbit Sense after my Versa 2, which I loved, died. I thought that, since it was a newer product, that it would be better. It still has all the functions I liked on the Versa 2 and I do like the addition of stress monitoring and skin temperature tracking. Also, now I don't need a special clock face to have SPO2 monitoring, which is good. But overall, I was greatly disappointed.First, it regularly loses connection with the phone/app, even when the phone is less than five feet away. I am also seeing a lot more sync errors than I saw with the Versa 2. Sometimes, even when the watch has synced and I can see things like my sleep score in the app, it won't show on the watch for hours.Some of the features I was looking forward to, like snore detection and SPO2 monitoring, are a battery suck. The watch is advertised as having 6+ days of battery life, but my initial experience had me needing to charge it every day. After several attempts to find the problem through customer service, I was told to turn off the snore monitoring. This increased the life to about 5 days. It makes no sense to me that they would not make sure that the battery supports the use of a built-in function. I have also had several issues with the watch somehow, on its own, opening the exercise app and getting stuck there. The only way to get out of it has been to restart the watch.The watch band is another problem. The design of the band for the newer smart watches is awful. As seen in pictures, instead of the end of the band being secured under a loop, this one has a tuck under design so that the end is sandwiched between the strap and your skin. This design is uncomfortable and has caused a lot of chafing on my wrist. This is something that I never experienced with the Versa 2 watch band. The only good thing I can say about this new design is that it is easier to change the band as it just clips in rather than needing to fuss and fumble with the pins on traditional watch bands.I am mostly happy with the Sense. It does what I need it to and the issues I have faced are not enough to keep me from getting another Fitbit product in the future. I just hope the issues I am having, and those I have seen in others' reviews, are addressed in future product designs.",

In addition, your phone sync is fast and stable, ensuring a seamless connected experience.The battery life is also remarkable: it offers several days of use on a single charge, something that is really appreciated in an everyday device.

Now, the primary reason I purchased it was for the larger screen. On my previous smartwatch, my old eyes struggled to read text messages, steps, and even the time. The screen size on this watch makes those non-issues. I found the setup to be easy and now have my watch synced with Google Fit. Not only do my steps get tracked, but it also tracks my sleep, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels. I frequently have my phone set on silent, but no longer have to worry about missing a text or call because they come through on my watch - I can even answer (and make) calls through this smartwatch! Even though I had it for just a few days, I loved it enough that I purchased another one for my mom for Mother's Day!",

Before you do this, you have to download the app of the new version VERY FIT.. very easy to install as well. You can receive calls, it shows the caller information, make calls, receive calls, receive emails, receive text messages.. basically everything you can do with an Apple Watch except answering the text messages back. But who needs to answer text messages when you are Bluetooth to your phone and it\u2019s not far away from you. The price is amazing.. I\u2019ve had people tell me , \u201c is that an Apple Watch? When I tell them everything the watch does and the price, they are all speechless. Another amazing benefit it has, you can even personalize your very own screen saver. The benefits for your health is just as great as the phone .. it will alert you if your pulse is too high, reminds you every hour to drink fluids.. which this is all in the app. What\u2019s the best part about this watch.. it\u2019s user friendly. Battery last up to 3 days, sounds of calls are great.. there is absolutely nothing I can find wrong with this watch and recommend for anyone of any age to purchase it.

I enjoy the look of the Versa and the feel of it. It is lighter the the Ionic, which is a great watch too. Amazon delivered it at a timely matter. No problems with Amazon at all. However, after ordering the Versa, I found out that you cannot have two watches (I have the ionic and this one now) working simultaneously on one account. I did not know this until after I ordered the watch and tried to cancel the order upto 3 hours later but it was too late. In order for me to wear them both using the same account is to sync all the latest stats then delete the one watch and put the other watch on the account. This takes over about 30 minutes for the switch over time and you must have WiFi. The second  watch then states that you walked zero steps but your phone app states the correct amount of steps added from both watches. I walk over 42,000 to 45,000 steps per day. I need to walk a certain amount of steps per hour to achieve this total. After switching watches, I would need my phone app to see if I am achieving my hourly goal. I cannot do this at times because I cannot have my phone while I work.  Also, a very tiny dislike to this watch, is that there are not a lot of watch faces for this watch but give it time, it\u2019s the newest one they have so there could be more coming in the future.  If I could give Amazon 4 stars, I would but I gave Fitbit only one star (wish I could give it only 1/2 of one) for not being able to run two watches simultaneously on one account. Great big mistake that needs to be fixed and fixed before they rolled the first Versa off of the assembly line.",

Although I couldn't verify the blood pressure feature, the step count, calorie tracking, sleep monitoring, and travel distance all appear to function accurately.For data synchronization, the device connects via Bluetooth to its dedicated app. Please note that synchronization can take a moment; it's not instantaneous. The app also offers the convenient option to share your data with native Apple Health and Android health apps if you prefer.The device features a sharp, clear OLED screen. Through the companion app, you can select various watch faces that display your most recent data readings. I've configured mine for continuous monitoring, which does consume more battery, but you can also opt for manual readings as needed. Additionally, it includes several pre-set sport functions.Other notable features include customizable phone notifications, call alerts, and remote control for music applications. Overall, it's a decent device at a good price. It's important to understand that this is not a smartwatch where you can load additional apps.

I really liked that I had a choice of dials, so I picked one where I could see the time, date, day of the week, weather, my steps, and battery level. I loved that the dial was much larger than the more expensive and more complicated Fitbit, yet it still fit nicely on my small female wrist. I love how you can adjust the brightness to so many levels, but what sinched the deal for me was the way I could push the sport of my choice to track my steps, calories burned, and heart rate. For example, I track aerobics, barre, mixed cardio, and folk dance classes, in addition to weight training. All this and much more from a relatively inexpensive fitness tracker. I just love this watch so much, but the band broke off after only 4 months of normal use. That's when I contacted the product's Customer Service folks via email, along with my photos of how the band broke with pieces of the watch inside it. Customer Service offered to send me a replacement free of charge. It arrived very quickly from the company. After that, I had many questions and customer service would respond within 24 hours with a solution for me. (Unfortunately, you can't call them, but their responses always included diagrams and steps that worked for me.) There are even many functions I don't use on this watch. I'm very impressed with the phone app too!

I tried a newer Fitbit but it only provided that check manually instead of automatically- which made it worthless to me.I was diagnosed recently with sleep apnea and this watch is invaluable to me since it gives me a pretty accurate summary each morning and the app rates my sleep quality and provides data for the amount of REM sleep that I got the previous night.When you set up the app you can designate whether the watch is on your dominant wrist and you can also change the sensitivity of the sleep program.On a different note- the first watch that was shipped wouldn't charge on my computer, they immediately shipped its replacement and it worked perfectly.The only trick was that I had to uninstall my previous watch from my phone app and then it detected my new watch and I was able to proceed with the installation.",

Before the update, my watch stayed charged at least 4 days, after the update it would need recharging every 12 hours. Then just a day ago it started only holding a charge for 2 hours or so. And now, today, my Fitbit just completely died. I'm really disappointed that after 5 months and $110, my Fitbit died. I can't bring myself to purchase another one even though I really love it because after a quick Google search, the reduced battery charge after completing firmware updates seems to have been an ongoing issue since at least 2016. But in my case, all they did was convince a guaranteed lifetime customer to seek a different product, which is very disheartening considering how much I really loved their Versa brand.UPDATE: I called Fitbit, they troubleshot my watch, confirmed I was still under warranty and gave me a choice of 50% off an upgraded watch or send another replacement of my current watch for free. I like my current watch, so I opted for that. If your watch is giving you problems or dies and it's been less than a year since you purchased it, call them and they will help you find the best solution. All of their watches in the U.S. have a one year warranty that they honor. Thank you Fitbit!",

A mic to command Amazon Alexa is in their place. She can do things like set timers, alarms, reply to texts, give you the weather forecast as well as a FEW other useful things.The processor is faster. Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day.

        "review": "One week ago, I would have rated this with 5-stars.  However, for some unknown reason, the battery life, which was 3+ days, has gone down to about 8 hours.  I haven't downloaded any apps or changed the settings I have been using for the past month; the only change has been some sort of software update.I'm giving a temporary 3-stars in hopes that I can figure out a solution.  If I can, I'll bring this up to 5-stars.  If I can't, I'll lower this to 1-star and return it.  Either way, once I figure out what I'm going to do, I'll provide better feedback with what I like and dislike, etc....====Update:  So, after the watch completely discharged its battery, and I let it fully charge again, I'm back to a full 3 days of use.  The only setting I changed after it charged was turning the 'connections -> wifi' from 'auto' to 'off'.  I figure I almost always have my phone, and if I don't, I'm probably not near an open access point WITHOUT a captive portal (requiring browser-based login).  That doesn't necessarily explain the battery drain because this was how I had the setting previously.This is a great watch, based on what I was looking for.  I previously had an LG G watch, one of those goofy-ass rectangular smartwatches, and other than the style, i really liked the functionality.  I like the style of many new round smartwatches, but they were either prohibitively expensive (Tag Heuer), or the battery life was crap (most smartwatches), or, in the case of the LG Watch Sport and Style, you either got more than you wanted and paid for it, or not enough.My criteria:Looks (subjective, but essentially, a round smartwatch that wasn't too bulky, but with a screen big enough to use)Functionality (had to work with a non-Samsung Android smartwatch, show notifications from hangouts, SMS, calendar, etc)Battery Life (had to very easily make it through 24 hours)Non-LTE versionI think the watch looks great.  I'm a bigger dude, so the watch doesn't look out of place and huge on my wrist like some of the other photos I've seen.  If you have svelte features, maybe the size would be problematic.  I'm using the standard band that comes with the watch, which looks good, but I like that I can easily switch bands if I want to.Functionally, the watch is great.  I get notifications from SMS and Hangouts, as well as from Google calendar, which I use at work for upcoming meetings.  Initially, as I was researching the watch, I wasn't sure if a non-Samsung watch would pair well with this, since it doesn't run Android Wear (it runs Samsung's Tizen OS).  The only issue with regard to Tizen is the lack of apps, but I don't really care about extending the capabilities beyond what it already does (wihch is what I need/want).  The watch has decent sensors for 'exercise', though I suspect there are superior watches for that.  I don't exercise that much and don't care about measuring my heart-rate anyway.  I can feel my heart about to explode out of my chest when I play hockey, which is a good enough indicator that I'm getting some exercise.Battery life is awesome.  I'm currently on my third day since its last charge, and other than the weird drain issue I first wrote about, the watch has been solid.  I do currently have wifi off, as well as location, since I usually have my cell phone nearby; the watch gets that info from the phone.  Knowing I can turn either of those on, if I needed to, is nice.  I also have my watch face set to only turn on when I move my wrist or push a button.  I've read that keeping the display always-on would reduce battery quite a bit.  Good thing I'm not always looking at the watch face.Bonus features!Samsung Pay.  I never used Android pay (NFC) for purchases.  I was sort of waiting until it was more ubiquitous and expected, as opposed to everyone looking at you like 'one of those types'.  That's just my own insecurity though.  But with this watch, I just press a button, select a card, and then hold the watch near the card-paying-thingie (NFC terminal) at the store.  That's great and all, but what's really super great is that it doesn't have to be an NFC terminal.  As long as it's got the magnetic strip, this watch will work!  I tried it at a local liquor store and the woman said, \"this device is really old and doesn't have that fancy technology.\"  I replied, \"this watch is magic, check this out!\".  We were both pretty impressed.Another feature I really like is how you can reply to messages.  There is an old phone style keyboard, with 2-3 letter per number, which is just terrible.  There is the ability to speak into the watch, which I don't use because nothing comes close to Google's speech recognition, in my option.  And the other option is to draw the letters on the screen.  I wasn't sure how well that would work; it works great!  Just draw each letter, quickly, if you want, with an underscore for a 'space', and then send.  Love it.Finally, Dick Tracy, you can answer phone calls through your watch.  Just speak into it.  I haven't really used this, and figure I will never use it unless I'm tied to a shark, which is tied to a missile, or maybe if I'm driving (I don't have Bluetooth in my car).  But it's cool.Anyway, this is a good watch.",

        "review": "Note: I have a Samsung Note 5, and that is the phone this watch was used with.I did a ton of research before buying my first smart watch about 6 months ago. Before I purchased this, I did some cursory research and found the Gear S3 was still pretty great, despite newcomers to the market, so I purchased it.When I first got the watch, I was so excited. I put it on and paired it and was super impressed with the exceptionally well designed and responsive UI. Using the bezel to control the watch is a stroke of pure genius, honestly. Despite the small area of the physical face of the watch, and how very tiny the icons on it are, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was able to easily and without error interact with the small icons.Then came the disappointment.The app store for the Gear is exceptionally anemic, primarily consisting of watch faces and applications that are very niche. There is no Gear support for Pandora, or Audible. Absolutely no Google apps are available for it. No Google Now. No Google Maps (although there is a well-designed app available in the store that uses Google Maps for like $2). No Android Pay. No Gmail. Nothing. The Spotify app is pretty nice, but for some reason I can't select Spotify Radio stations in it, only playlists. I was exceptionally disappointed as I have based everything in Google. Pretty much, the only apps that are really any good are from Samsung. This was a further disappointment as Samsung apps are usually fat and offensively slow.I contemplated returning it in favor of a Huwaii or a LG Watch Sport, but I figured I'd give it a few days. The interface is just SO well made. It is very responsive. The Samsung apps actually aren't crap this time, and they covered most of the use cases I have for my watch. So I gave it a few days.This is the part where the 5 stars come in.After using it for a few days and acquainting myself with it's various idiosyncrasies, I began to realize that all I actually need for it are the Samsung apps. It *would* be nice if there were apps from Pandora and Audible and CityMapper and Moovit and it supported Google Now, but it doesn't and that is actually a very workable scenario.The watch allows me to control my phone, basically, without taking it out of my pocket. So while I'm on the bus, if I swipe down on the watch face and hit the music note icon, I can control all aspects of the playback on my phone from the watch. Rewind, fast forward, pause, change the volume, change tracks, all of it. The altimeter is very accurate. I can create reminders and appointments right on the watch face. It displays the weather and my agenda using very will designed UIs. With a tap, I can zoom in on the weather and agenda to get more information, and I can plot the route to an appointment, if I included location information in the calendar item (although you have to open the phone to see the route). There is an Uber app for the watch that makes it very easy to call a cab.Finally, the watchfaces. Yes, they do get their own section because they are varied and amazing. Personally, I love the PipBoy Fallout 4 watch face. It displays an amazing amount of information using the interface of one of my favorite games. This watch face displays the following information, but you can find probably another 100 that do the same in zany and creative ways: Time, Date, Heartrate, Water Consumption, Coffee Consumption, Battery Level, Step Count, plus shortcuts to Music and Pictures, Samsung Health Daily Review, Alarms and Calendar. I wish the PipBoy interface showed the temperature, because if it did it would be on there too.Now, for the downsides, and there are some doozies.1) Samsung Pay does not work on my phone because I enabled the Samsung-provided Knox feature. I later disabled it because I didn't like it. But you know what that did? It flipped flag on my phone that disables Samsung Pay. The Gear only works with Samsung Pay. Let me repeat that - A Samsung supplied feature, Knox, disables Samsung Pay, because it flips the flag that says the device has been rooted. You are probably thinking \"OK, so I contact Samsung support and they fix it, right?\" Nope. Samsung has no way to flip this flag back. They designed Knox in such a way that it makes your phone think it has been rooted, and they have no way to fix it if Knox is later disabled. That is exceptionally stupid. I am an engineer. I am aghast to think of the internal processes at Samsung that allowed a feature to be released into the wild that breaks your phone and does not supply a fix. It requires a monumental level of dysfunction for that to happen.2) You are limited to the Samsung ecosystem. So if you don't like Samsung mail, too bad. No other mail client available. Don't like Samsung Pay? Too bad. No other option available. Etc.3) If Samsung Mail is enabled, and it is connected to a company mail server that requires the watch to be encrypted to view mail, you will have to type in a pin just to check the time. Yup, you read that right. Want to just check the time really quick? Nope! You gotta type in your password first. Again, as an engineer, how does that get through focus testing without any developer hearing a customer say \"that is amazingly stupid\". How does a developer, in their OWN DEVELOPMENT of the software, not get tired of typing in their password to check the time? It's amazing.4) When you make the motion typical of checking the time on a watch, the watch face is supposed to light up automatically. I've found this to be rather untrue. I've found that it pretty much doesn't work unless you are moving your hand from a stationary position, such as standing at a bus stop or sitting at your desk. If your hand is in motion it doesn't seem to recognize the motion to look at it, despite the rather unique motion of rotating the wrist. That is a very unique movement, and I noticed that this does not happen to a friend who has the Apple watch. It seems to actually be keyed on the wrist flip to turn on, as it turns on in a movie theatre when you place your hands behind your head.In summary, great watch despite the lack of app support",

And they offer many free fun watch wallpaper\u2019s. I wore the watch to work, I only work part time but the watch stayed at full charge through my entire 6 hour shift. And I had no issues with receiving notifications from my phone to my watch. Overall I\u2019m very pleased with the quality and functionality of the watch. I have an Apple phone, and I have had an Apple Watch before. I\u2019m not saying Apple Watches are horrible but if you are looking for a quality watch for a reasonable price, this watch will do the job just fine. It looks pretty classy and modern. I like that it\u2019s round shaped, gives off a more glamorous vibe. Felt nice on my wrist too, not too bulky or tight. Doesn\u2019t make my wrist sweaty either. It\u2019s really a great buy in my opinion. Pleased with my purchase \u263a\ufe0f",

I switched the app to my Android phone and had a much better and easier experience.  The app is easy to use and the  health metrics are very nice.  It stays connected to my phone and and me when I need to sync the app to refresh the data which is good because I will forget. Answering calls by the watch is a nice feature and new to me.

        "review": "I received the watch today and was eager to try it out. The set-up is very simple. It requires installation of the app, which you can then use to download different watch faces and enter your personal information. It took less than 10 minutes to download and install all of the watch faces I wanted to try.I love that the device has great battery life. This is the primary reason that I wanted to try using a 3rd party app despite being an iPhone user. What I later discovered after my first workout has prompted me to return the watch for a much pricier Apple Watch SE 2. While the device seemed to have comparable heart rate readings to the treadmill I was using, the distance calculation was off. I have a short stride, so their default treadmill setting doesn\u2019t appear to work for me. I walked 2.5 miles, but the watch stated that my total distance was 2.83 miles. While this isn\u2019t a huge difference, I can see how it would add up on longer walks. There is also no way to edit the entry in the app to correct the information. In addition, my step counts seem to take time to add to Apple Health. The information from the VeryFit app appeared to be logged in Apple Health, but for some reason, the data was not being added to the total steps for today. It seems like there is some kind of lag, which isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but it is inconvenient to wait for everything to update.I wish this watch had worked out for me. Unfortunately, the lack of ability to calibrate distance makes this watch pretty useless.",

To have your watch come on, you gently tap the screen or press the crown button. This has greatly improved the battery life. But YOU shouldn't have to do that with a watch that costs this much.On the plus side, you can change just about every setting imaginable, and the Fitbit is a nice touch (despite most of the good features behind a subscription service). That's called Google greed. You'll get used to it. They're a monopoly for a reason. Using it to make and receive calls is awesome. Got a call the other day and was able to talk as I washed the dishes. No earbuds are required. The person who called me said the audio was great.I highly recommend this if you don't mind the craptacular battery life. I'm surprised they didn't fix it with a software update. Something is feasting on the power. Or they went with the lowest bidder for parts.Oh, if you have fat fingers or medium-sized ones, forget about the keyboard. LOL. You'll need a stylus (yes they work). The speech-to-text is very good but you have to remember to say \"period\" or \"comma\" when composing messages. If you don't, it'll be one long sentence without proper punctuation. You can even say \"heart emoji\" and it'll insert that. You can also go back and edit the message with your fingers and use the keyboard to correct mistakes. I'll update my review if needed and the longer I use it. Oh, the ECG works and is very cool.

After much soul searching, I knew I had to make a decision. so the gambler in me decided to try something new.  I'm glad I did!Now clearly, a watch released less than 6 months ago is going to out perform one released 6 or 7 years ago. But  the improvement in performance is remarkable.It's faster responding, pairs quickly and easily with my Pixel 6a smartphone, and has superior software.It's really the software that makes the smartwatch useful and productive. And to Samsung's credit, they kept my old war horse's software current.  But, the Fitbit software is much more modern than Samsung Health. It can scan barcode label on food packages when I record what I eat and it is much more flexible in terms of how the nutrient servings list is recorded.  And that means less manual calculations when trying adjust servings from grams to, say, ounces.Heart monitoring is more accurate, stair climbing is much more accurate, and sleep monitoring is actually usable. It might be the advancements in sensor quality rather than the software algorithms. But I do trust the results more.Charging the battery is FAST.  I get about 36 hours of life from the battery, on about 45 minutes of charging. Twenty minutes of charging while I shower in the morning will give me about 12 hours of battery life.  The wireless magnetic charger is a little different from the Samsung watch, but it is very functional. The user needs to make sure that the crown and stem is parallel to the power cord, and once the watch is about an inch away from the charger, the charger is drawn to the watch magnetically and it leaps up and connects to the watch. This is not BS on my part, it happens everyday. Only once has this connection not been made perfectly.The PW 2, is smaller and lighter, physically.  It's about the size of a traditional men's mechanical dress watch. My ancient eyes can see the slightly smaller screen with ease.  My arthritic gorilla fingers akso have no problem manipulating the screen.  It is comfortable to wear long term, even to bed, for sleep monitoring.  It offers a more classy and elegant appearance than the larger and sportier S6 Pro.I was comfortable with the new user interface within a day or two; so I think people coming from another brand won't have a huge learning curve. Like the Pixel Smartphones, Google uses a simple and uncluttered interface that I found very intuitive.I am quite pleased with my purchase,and can recommend it to others.",

Now, the primary reason I purchased it was for the larger screen. On my previous smartwatch, my old eyes struggled to read text messages, steps, and even the time. The screen size on this watch makes those non-issues. I found the setup to be easy and now have my watch synced with Google Fit. Not only do my steps get tracked, but it also tracks my sleep, heart rate, and oxygen saturation levels. I frequently have my phone set on silent, but no longer have to worry about missing a text or call because they come through on my watch - I can even answer (and make) calls through this smartwatch!

You can receive calls, it shows the caller information, make calls, receive calls, receive emails, receive text messages.. basically everything you can do with an Apple Watch except answering the text messages back. But who needs to answer text messages when you are Bluetooth to your phone and it\u2019s not far away from you. The price is amazing.. I\u2019ve had people tell me , \u201c is that an Apple Watch? When I tell them everything the watch does and the price, they are all speechless. Another amazing benefit it has, you can even personalize your very own screen saver. The benefits for your health is just as great as the phone .. it will alert you if your pulse is too high, reminds you every hour to drink fluids.. which this is all in the app. What\u2019s the best part about this watch.. it\u2019s user friendly. Battery last up to 3 days, sounds of calls are great.. there is absolutely nothing I can find wrong with this watch and recommend for anyone of any age to purchase it.

So I sent it back for replacement, and after a little while, the new one comes and it works considerably longer, with no unusual flaws.I have been using it for the past few months now and battery life is still the same. No new problems have popped up, and it works well with the features on my Pixel 7, including camera and Pixel's Personal Safety. It's a nice accessory to answer calls, respond to messages and notifications, track fitness, and more. There is a current issue with it, though, where music apps will bug out if you flip the watch when they're open, but otherwise I have no issues with the Wear OS.I would like to mention that, even on the Google Store website, it notes how the battery life on the original Pixel Watch doesn't last long enough (I have to charge it every morning), compared to all-day battery life on the Pixel Watch 2, so that's something to consider when choosing between this and the newer model.",

I've tested the heart rate against other machines a dozen times, it's never more than a couple beats difference. The GPS is good enough, occasionally vulnerable to super heavy weather. That said, it succeeded in tracking most of my movement skiing in a blizzard, so not bad!But here's the thing: two years old, the battery life is down to 6 days with no exercise. Every hour of activity tracking takes away a full day of battery life. I thought I could do a weekend on Manhattan without my charger, but it tracked every walk around town, and the battery died in 1.5 days.  (BTW it spontaneously tracked 6 of my 11 miles walking around town)Music function with Bluetooth is pretty good, sometimes broken. Between my left wrist and right ear, that's disappointing.

As someone who currently doesn't have a big name phone (no Galaxy or Apple), nor did I want to have to pay a subscription fee to unlock my smart watch's full capabilities (FitBit...), I was glad to find that Wear OS was what I needed. The Fossil brand is reputable and as far as this watch goes, it has been durable AND pretty. The band is like a lilac color. The stones around the face watch give a nice glimmer/shine in the light, which is a nice touch.The watch's capabilities have everything I wanted: Google pay (SO, SO NICE to have to tap to pay!!) talk to text, notifications routed to watch, sleep tracker, step counter, and even a blood oxygen monitor which is nice in these pandemic times.A few other things that have been nice to have: taking phone calls on my watch(!!!), timer capabilities, calendar/agenda.I found in my research that a lot of smart watches focus on step counting, heart rate stuff and health which is nice but I was looking for details on functionality beyond that like responding to text messages, paying with my watch and maybe listening to music (this watch currently only supports spotify so I can't say how good or bad it is as I use another service and haven't yet tried spotify). This watch checks all those boxes. I love that when I'm working, i can quickly and discreetly respond to messages or swipe away calls. If i want to leave my wallet behind, i can tap to pay qithout dragging my phone out. The Wear OS app has a few different watch faces and helps you set the watch up to your liking. I'm pretty happy with that. The battery life has been great--able to wear and use all day and still have about 30% left by the end of the day. Not bad!The only thing I would change is the ability to access text messages. As far as I can see you can only respond when you get a new one in, and can't start one. There is so much going on with this watch, I am sure I just missed it somehow!This says it will support ALEXA but as of this review it hasn't rolled out yet. Still great without it.The buttons on the side are a little bulky and get caught on things now and then. However, I really like using them as shortcuts! It has helped. The face watch is definitely big enough to swipe with no issues. And it's circular face still allows for plenty of screen.This is getting long but it is a really cool, high functioning watch. It doesn't clash with my everyday clothes and has looked great on my wrist.",

So close, but not quite there yet.Setup was fast and easy, but the occasional annoying glitch (e.g. it disconnects from my phone almost every time I take the watch off when my phone is charging) keeps me from 100% enthusiastically recommending it to non-tech friendly friends/family.Stuff I love: workout tracking. This is probably the number 1 reason I bought the watch. I work out daily, and I love the tracking features of the watch. Blood oxygen is a nice added bonus to go with the workout tracking. Notifications & the ability to respond to messages from my watch--this is so nice when I'm out, and my phone is in my purse or pocket. Being able to ring my phone when I leave it somewhere in the house, and don't remember where.Did I mention that the watch itself is really nice looking?? I love that the Fossil looks like an actual watch and not some crappy plastic smartwatch. I have two bands for it -- the silicone one it came with, and I picked up the metal mesh band from Fossil, as well. Despite the Galaxy Watch 4's superior features (and WearOS 3), I never even considered it -- it looks too much like a smartwatch. I'm a Samsung phone owner, too.Stuff I don't love: the slightly buggy quirks. Sometimes the watch just refuses to connect to my phone. I can toggle the connection over and over in the WearOS app on my phone, and it still won't connect. Only rebooting the watch at that point will solve the problem. If you never take the watch off, you may never see this, but since I don't use sleep tracking (it creeps me out), I take it off at night and leave the watch to charge in a separate room from where I'm sleeping.Overall, this watch is a solid buy. I'm using it with a Samsung Z Flip 3 phone. 99% of the time, it functions flawlessly -- if they could iron out that 1% of quirks, I'd be recommending it to anyone and everyone.",

        "review": "After researching a few different smartwatches, I am really glad that I landed on this Fossil watch with Wear OS. As someone who currently doesn't have a big name phone (no Galaxy or Apple), nor did I want to have to pay a subscription fee to unlock my smart watch's full capabilities (FitBit...), I was glad to find that Wear OS was what I needed. The Fossil brand is reputable and as far as this watch goes, it has been durable AND pretty. The band is like a lilac color. The stones around the face watch give a nice glimmer/shine in the light, which is a nice touch.The watch's capabilities have everything I wanted: Google pay (SO, SO NICE to have to tap to pay!!) talk to text, notifications routed to watch, sleep tracker, step counter, and even a blood oxygen monitor which is nice in these pandemic times.A few other things that have been nice to have: taking phone calls on my watch(!!!), timer capabilities, calendar/agenda.I found in my research that a lot of smart watches focus on step counting, heart rate stuff and health which is nice but I was looking for details on functionality beyond that like responding to text messages, paying with my watch and maybe listening to music (this watch currently only supports spotify so I can't say how good or bad it is as I use another service and haven't yet tried spotify). This watch checks all those boxes. I love that when I'm working, i can quickly and discreetly respond to messages or swipe away calls. If i want to leave my wallet behind, i can tap to pay qithout dragging my phone out. The Wear OS app has a few different watch faces and helps you set the watch up to your liking. I'm pretty happy with that. The battery life has been great--able to wear and use all day and still have about 30% left by the end of the day. Not bad!The only thing I would change is the ability to access text messages. As far as I can see you can only respond when you get a new one in, and can't start one. There is so much going on with this watch, I am sure I just missed it somehow!This says it will support ALEXA but as of this review it hasn't rolled out yet. Still great without it.The buttons on the side are a little bulky and get caught on things now and then. However, I really like using them as shortcuts! It has helped. The face watch is definitely big enough to swipe with no issues. And it's circular face still allows for plenty of screen.This is getting long but it is a really cool, high functioning watch. It doesn't clash with my everyday clothes and has looked great on my wrist.",

After trying Fitbit's Charge 3 as my first sports tracker (which I posted a review on Amazon with a bottom line of excellent hardware but very lacking software) I decided to pull the trigger on this one.The size of the watch is perfect for me, not big so that I am carrying a wok in my wrist and not that small that I can't read anything on the screen.  I have been using it all day and all night and it doesn't bother me while sleeping.The Garmin software is very good and customizable.  The watch interface doesn't take long to get use to and it is very intuitive: Press the button and the excersice options are available, long press the button and the controls menu options becomes available.  Long pressing the screen will show the watch's many options (change watch face, Stats, Settings, etc)The preloaded wacht faces aren't that useful to me but there is a lot of good watch faces in the store that can be reached through the app.  By the way all of the third parties watch faces I have downloaded can only be customized (you can decide colors, which parameter to be shown like HR, altitude, Bar Pressure, Steps, Temperature, etc) within the app and not directly on the watch as the Garmin's propietary watch faces.The battery can last between 4 and 5 days tops.

When weared at night the gesture auto on bothers and when off I can still touch the screen to check the time (or whatever screen I chose to)Speaking about the screen, personally I think the transflective screen is a great idea, the more illuminated the watch is, the more crisp and clear the display gets.  By the way, all of the pictures seen on the web about the screen are actually or taken on a full sunlight condition or digitally improved because the resolution of the screen isn't one of the watch's strenghts.  But again, at least for me it is pretty useful.The HR monitor is good, and as almost all the wrist HR monitors (so I have read) it lacks in keeping up in intensity intervals.The button is supposed to be customizable in a way that the screen can be flipped so that the button can be at the left side while wearing it on the left hand (useful while wearing gloves during cycling), but it seems that the actual version of the sofware has deleted that option because it is no longer in any of the menus (that is too bad because it is a very cool feature)Haven't use the music option, I really didn't buy it for listening to music since I always workout with my phone at hand, but the looks of the music VA3 was mucho mor appealing to me than the regular one and I paid no more than a $30 difference for itBottom line, I think it is a pretty good sports activity watch and I am very happy with it, I hope it stands the test of time in every aspect of it",

        "review": "I've had this watch for a little more than a week and am very pleased with it.Garmin masters the fitness angle very well.  The interface works well and gives you almost all the stats you would need.  Many more are available through third party apps, etc.  I like that the data screens are customizable and you can rotate between different views.  You can even choose the speed at which the screens rotate.  Another nice feature is that you can lock the screen during a workout.  I had heard concerns from some reviewers of rain or sweat accidentally pausing or stopping a workout.  With the option to use the screen lock, this won't happen.  To unlock, you simply hold down the button for about 5 seconds.From my experience so far the altimeter isn't very accurate.  I've done workouts that are the same route out and back and have gotten ascent/descent numbers that are 100 feet off.  However, this is likely more accurate than a watch that has just GPS and not barometric altimeter.The heart rate seem very accurate from my experience.  I have used on slow long runs, and more intense speed intervals.One feature I wish Garmin would build our more (or maybe I just haven't full figured out yet?) is Livetracking.  I'd love to be able to just turn it on whenever I go for a run so that my wife can know where I am.I really like that the watch tracks your cadence.  As an avid runner, it's helpful to see where I am at during my workout and helps me to improve my running economy/efficiency.  You can even set alerts to notify you (vibrate) when you are above or below a certain cadence.Battery life appears to be accurate to garmin's specs.  I have it paired to some skull candy headphones and a 2.5 hour long run drained about half the battery (in GPS + Glonass mode).  The watch probably could last 5 days on just normal mode, but I usually charge mine every other day once the battery gets closer to 40% battery life.  The charging is really fast though.  Only takes about 30 minutes to charge it up.Smart features are nice and useful.  No concerns here as it integrates very well with my Samsung phone.Build quality is good.  The watch seems oddly lightweight initially, but it's sturdy and it's weight allows it to be worn day and night (for sleep tracking) comfortably.I read in some reviews that the way the watch is shaped led to fingers getting scratched as you use the touchscreen/swipe.  I'm not sure how that is possible and I have not had any issues there.The one thing that I don't love about this watch is that it's usable screen space is about half the size of the actual watch face.  The outside rim or bezel is too large and I wish that was just more screen space.  I am sure that Garmin has a good reason for this (something to do with engineering and fitting the features in the watch), but I really wish I had the whole screen space to work with.This is a great watch if you can find it for less than retail.  At $300 it's really pushing the boundaries of what it does.  If you can find it closer to $250, you've got yourself a great deal.",

There is no volume control on the watch.  If you\u2019re in a noisy place it would be difficult to hear.  But, I have my phone with me, so I don\u2019t really need the watch too make a call, but it\u2019s nice to know that I can if I want to.  I like the sleep tracker function.  The watch holds its charge for a long time. I charge it about once a week.  I am surprised that for its low price, it actually can do quite a lot.  I like that you do not have to purchase a subscription for it, like you have to for some devices. It is easy to use and quick to set up. I also like being able to read my text messages on it.",

        "review": "I have not worn a watch for many many years. So I wasn't going to drop a lot of money on something I might not wear for more than a few days.I bought the watch with the gold strap. This did not work very well. It kept getting caught and slipping off. Fortunately, the company had also provided a (pink) silicone strap. This worked properly. After a while, I began to like the pink color. It matches the 'background' and makes the watch less of a glaring statement. Unlike my experiences a long time back, I found this very comfortable and was able to wear it 24/7 without any issues. The battery is frugal and only required charging while showering.The watch comes with an app which has previously had some pretty negative reviews. However, once you get over some of its quirks, it is not too bad. The exercise videos are well organized. I don't know how good they are as exercise (not my area of expertise), but having well organized ones you can actually do is better than not doing any. One really odd thing about them is the bug that only displayed 1/3 of the video screen on my tablet. To fix that, start in portrait mode; then press the little change aspect icon in top right; then rotate screen to landscape. Strange, but it works  every time.The blood pressure, pulse, and O2 seem sufficiently accurate. The step counter, however, was way off for me. Perhaps I fidget too much, or whatever, but it is not even close to being what it should be. That likely explains why this product has so many returns.If you want an accurate step counter, this might not be it [Update: While walking, it seems ok, but it clocks up all sorts of things while not active]. I went and bought another watch that was much better for this aspect. There are things to like and dislike on both watches, so I am keeping both of them. The watch faces on the Nexa are more to my liking, and a couple of other things I prefer.The menu structures and features make this agreeable as a watch. They work well, and don't require more than a few minutes to get used to them. The timer, alarms, and similar were all easy to use. I liked the 5-day weather. (The alarm time, has to be set in the app, but can be tre-riggered in the watch). The timer has several one-button options, such a 5 minutes, 15 minutes etc. They have a varied range of watch face styles. A few good ones in there.Like a lot of these products, there are a lot of \"why didn't they...\" thoughts that come to mind, but none are especially show-stopping. Just a commentary on the s/w design process that lacks creativity and independence of thought to come up with better implementations.All in all, a nice watch. The step counter seems to count when it shouldn't, but seems more or less on target while actually walking.",

Very unlike the goldtone color in the picture.  I was expecting to receive another less formal looking band to use with it.  I was disappointed there wasn't one.  The picture on the user manual shows a black band and the rose gold.  The second page of the user manual \"What's in the package? It shows a picture of the watch, the charging cable and the user manual...no mention of the second wristband like it says on the website.I'll update in the morning after its been charged.Its on the charger so I haven't been able to turn it on yet.  It also does not come with a power adapter, only the cord.  The instructions say the screen will show the charging progress.

Its looks are extremely cute, vibrant colors, fits nice, was an easy set up and connected to our phones great. Screen is nice and easy to read. Battery life was good.

One standout feature is the phone functionality\u2014the call quality is clear, and I can answer calls and play music directly from the watch.

The battery life on the watch compared to one I paid about $15 more (more than 2 years ago) which always lasted 2 weeks was another weak point, because the battery usually only lasted a week with this one.

If you have an apple product then the ease of use is just that, easy to use. Even if its your first apple watch you would be able to get around after a few minutes of tinkering around. All in all it is the best watch for brand, quality, design, features ect. I love apple watches and im not only saying that because i use apple and have for years. I tend to give other products a once over just to see how they stand in comparison and yes there are others out there that might be cheaper and do most of the same functions but you get what you pay for as with anything in the world and apple is in my opinion top notch technology in todays ever expanding market.",

The unboxing experience is just as you would hope and expect from and apple product. The watch itself is just absolutely beautiful. The softwear ie ios is just unmatched in my opinon. The screen is bright and functions as good as a flagship item should. It charges very very fast and the battery last over a day as long as you dont have the always on display active. If you have an apple product then the ease of use is just that, easy to use. Even if its your first apple watch you would be able to get around after a few minutes of tinkering around. All in all it is the best watch for brand, quality, design, features ect. I love apple watches and im not only saying that because i use apple and have for years. I tend to give other products a once over just to see how they stand in comparison and yes there are others out there that might be cheaper and do most of the same functions but you get what you pay for as with anything in the world and apple is in my opinion top notch technology in todays ever expanding market.",

I wore it as suggested, and attempted troubleshooting as listed in the help function. These are the functions that were inaccurate beyond acceptable error ranges:Heart rate: it seemed to accurately detect heart rate while resting, but during workout it reported my heart rate as 102, when I could estimate my heart rate as 150+ by counting and using a timer. This inaccuracy extended over a 9 minute period of time when it indicated that it was measuring my heart rate continuously.I suspect that these inaccuracies stem from the heart rate issue:Stress monitoring (It reported my stress level as low or normal during times when I was close to an anxiety attack)Sleep monitoring (it reported 4 hours when I had 8 hours of sleep)Steps: it reported 100 steps before I had take any steps.Since these functions are the reason that I purchased this device, and as this is so far outside of manageable amounts of error, I have started a return and will not purchase from this company again.",

The only concerns/issues I have are: (1) because the watch is so lightweight, I'm concerned about it durability...definitely would not wear it in the garage while fixing things; (2) when paired with Pandora music app, the watch vibrates/notifies me every time the song changes no matter if its via my phone or car...I hope that maybe a setting change can fix this.  Overall, great smartwatch for normal everyday life and workouts but probably not the one for extreme sports and in the garage wear.",

Heart rate is on point, and there are tons of extra features.  You can set it up for almost any type of exercise that you do.  From walking on the treadmill, to walking outside.  Running, strength training, lap swimming, elliptical, rowing machine, you name it.  The weather is accurate on this as well.  It's just a beautiful watch.  For the rest of us, we don't need that Apple watch with the high price tag.  This watch is superior, and the price is right.  Another bonus, the charge lasts for days.  I need to charge mine tonight, after not charging it for 9 days.  This brand will forever be my go to.  I research EVERYTHING thoroughly, and after having bought a Garmin to give it a go, that thing was a hunk of junk.  I came across this one, read the reviews, and felt confident with my purchase.  You will not be sorry you bought this.  I can't tell you how many people I've told about this watch.",

The first thing that impressed me was the battery life \u2013 it actually lasts for 10 days without needing daily charging. This is a huge plus for those who don\u2019t want to worry about charging all the time.All the trackers work flawlessly: sleep monitoring, heart rate tracking, and sports modes \u2013 everything is accurate and reliable. The watch is comfortable, lightweight, and stylish, fitting perfectly on the wrist. The built-in GPS maps with navigation are a great bonus, making workouts and travel easier.I\u2019m really happy with my purchase and can confidently recommend this smartwatch to my friends and acquaintances. If you\u2019re looking for a smartwatch with long battery life, high-quality tracking, and great functionality, the Amazfit Active 2 is definitely worth considering!",

It looks so elegant on the wrist, and the quality feels amazing.There are so many useful features - one workout function alone has multiple training modes where you can track calories, plus detailed sleep tracking, notifications, and even a flashlight. I didn\u2019t expect it to be this good - it truly feels like a quality purchase.The watch face is a bit on the larger side, so it feels slightly more masculine and may be better suited for men - but I still really enjoy using it. Even though it\u2019s a bit big for me, the strap adjusts perfectly and makes it comfortable to wear.Funny enough, I forgot I had it on and accidentally took a shower with it - but nothing happened! The watch was totally fine. It even has a water cleaning mode, which is such a smart touch. Highly recommend!",

The battery life is so long, allowing me to go days without charging it, and when I do need to charge it, it charges very quickly. It\u2019s very easy to use and has a lot of helpful functions. I love being able to customize my watch face as well to match what I\u2019m wearing.

I've tested the heart rate against other machines a dozen times, it's never more than a couple beats difference. The GPS is good enough, occasionally vulnerable to super heavy weather. That said, it succeeded in tracking most of my movement skiing in a blizzard, so not bad!But here's the thing: two years old, the battery life is down to 6 days with no exercise. Every hour of activity tracking takes away a full day of battery life. I thought I could do a weekend on Manhattan without my charger, but it tracked every walk around town, and the battery died in 1.5 days.  (BTW it spontaneously tracked 6 of my 11 miles walking around town)Music function with Bluetooth is pretty good, sometimes broken. Between my left wrist and right ear, that's disappointing. But usually good enough to keep my rhythm on a 3-mile jog.I haven't found a better watch for these functions, but perfection would be great.",

So I recharged it and it's been great ever since. It'll last all day and part of the night. It doesn't seem to get as warm as it first did and it shuts off automatically when it's full. It works with my Fitbit app.  I wanted a Google watch that had the fall system in it. I am a senior citizen and that concerns me. It was easy for me to set up and the way it's made it doesn't feel that heavy on my arm. I haven't slept with it yet because I have been burned by other smart watches.
