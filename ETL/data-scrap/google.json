        "review": "This is a fantastic watch.  I've been a long-time Fossil smartwatch user.  My Fossil Gen 6 watch started acting up, and I recently learned that Fossil has exited smartwatches.  Once I switched to the Pixel 3, I was thrilled and do not miss my Gen 6 at all.  I should have switched sooner.My 2nd Fossil replacement alternative was the OnePlus 2.  The Pixel looked better (to me) and has Wear OS 5 which is the most recent version.  It was hard to decide between the two using online descriptions and reviews, but I am happy with my choice.  The Pixel battery life is better than the Fossil, even with the always on display, and easily gets me though the day.  The charge may not last as long as the OnePlus 2, but I do not wear it overnight and instead put the watch on the charger, so the extra battery life is not an issue for me.  Others may see this differently.The Pixel 3 screen is MUCH brighter and sharper than the Fossil, the processor is faster, and the watch operation is intuitive and easy to learn.  Activating the watch, setting it up, and switching from the Fossil was quick and easy since most of the apps and info are tied to my Google account.Long-time irritants with the Fossil were how the end of the watch band kept flopping loose from its holder band, and how the crown button constantly activated when I sharply bent my wrist.  The Pixel fixes both of these issues.  The Pixel watch band is a bit tricky to attach at first (YouTube helps), but it works MUCH better than the Fossil and is more comfortable.  The Pixel has a nice feature where you can rotate the watch display 180 degrees (make it upside down) so you can wear the crown button on the left side of the watch.  No more accidental app activations, restarts, or 911 calls!My primary watch use is for business to monitor emails and texts, and to see/screen/take phone calls.  All these work beautifully, and are handled much better than with the Fossil.  Even the weather app is upgraded in the new OS, and there is a timer that can be added to the tiles.  I use my watch secondarily for the health features, and I was sad (at first) to learn Google Fit would not be on the Pixel.  I used Fit on the Fossil to track steps and distance walked.  The new FitBit basic version is a true upgrade and gives me all the info I had before, plus a lot more.  I did not opt for the free Premium FitBit trial.I bought and recommend a set of the plastic watch covers for scratch and impact protection, and a charging stand.  Both work great.",

Instead I tried a couple of cheaper watches but didn't like the app they used.  I missed the Fitbit app.  I didn't want to order another Versa so I decided to try the Google Pixel 3 even though the watch was round and not square as my previous watch.  However,  I find it much more comfortable to wear and it's more attractive than I thought it would be.  I love how it functions and the choices of watch faces.  I also like the fall notification feature since I'm in my 80's.  I normally don't write reviews unless I feel strongly about something.  I felt compelled to share my joy with this watch.

I am a pixel phone user as well, so love that it connects with my Google fit and my Fitbit app. Lots of apps available on it, as well as phone answering and texting. Gps works great! I use it mostly to track my vitals and workouts. But my ring camera also connects to it and shows me when someone is at my door. Only negative is that the battery doesn't last long--maybe a day and a half. However, it charges quickly and I just set it on the charger while I do my makeup and get ready for my morning and it's almost fully charged by then. Lots of clock face customization too.",

It included both watch band sizes and a USB-C charging cable, but no wall outlet\u2014so if you don\u2019t already have a USB-C wall charger, you may want to pick one up.The watch face was pristine and the device was very clean\u2014overall, in excellent condition.Out of the box, the watch had a 34% charge and paired easily with my OnePlus phone. Even at that battery level, the battery saver mode held up well through a full 8-hour shift.Today, after a full charge, I used the watch mainly to track steps, check time, monitor health, and control media. I don\u2019t get a lot of notifications or spend much time fiddling with it, and by the end of my 8-hour shift, the battery was still at 78%. So far, the battery health seems excellent.Overall, I\u2019m really happy with the price and quality of this purchase\u2014great value.",

I can easily access my contacts and create a message or call someone directly from my watch if I can't get to my phone. I find the step count more accurate than Fitbit while pushing a baby stroller.It charges using a magnetic charger via Type-C and charges within about an hour. The battery doesn't last as long as I'd like but it doesn't bother me unless I forget to charge my watch in the morning.It keeps track of my heart rate and monitors for any irregular signs.Very decent way for the value!",

        "review": "So I quickly learned after getting the watch a few days ago to go into the watch's settings, click battery, and turn on the battery saver. To have your watch come on, you gently tap the screen or press the crown button. This has greatly improved the battery life. But YOU shouldn't have to do that with a watch that costs this much.On the plus side, you can change just about every setting imaginable, and the Fitbit is a nice touch (despite most of the good features behind a subscription service). That's called Google greed. You'll get used to it. They're a monopoly for a reason. Using it to make and receive calls is awesome. Got a call the other day and was able to talk as I washed the dishes. No earbuds are required. The person who called me said the audio was great.I highly recommend this if you don't mind the craptacular battery life. I'm surprised they didn't fix it with a software update. Something is feasting on the power. Or they went with the lowest bidder for parts.Oh, if you have fat fingers or medium-sized ones, forget about the keyboard. LOL. You'll need a stylus (yes they work). The speech-to-text is very good but you have to remember to say \"period\" or \"comma\" when composing messages. If you don't, it'll be one long sentence without proper punctuation. You can even say \"heart emoji\" and it'll insert that. You can also go back and edit the message with your fingers and use the keyboard to correct mistakes. I'll update my review if needed and the longer I use it. Oh, the ECG works and is very cool. Even the sleep monitor caught my apnea.",

I went with black on black because I'm not a fan of silver, and I love the look/color. The watch face I selected is bright enough, but not overwhelming. Definitely seems like a great value for the money, but time will tell.Update: 11/22/24- so I've had this watch for one month now and I absolutely love it. The only thing I would say that is negative about it, is it needs charged a lot... But other than that I am so happy with my purchase.",

        "review": "I recently purchased the Google Pixel Watch 2 as 'used - very good condition' and was absolutely thrilled with what I received. The watch arrived looking brand new, still in its original, albeit open, box with no signs of use whatsoever. The charging cable and extension band were also neatly tucked inside.From a design perspective, this watch is truly a stunner. The aesthetics are very pleasing, and it feels like a premium device on the wrist. Google has clearly used top-tier components, as evidenced by its smooth performance and responsive interface. For me, the size is perfect \u2013 it's substantial enough to make a statement but not so bulky that it feels uncomfortable for all-day wear.Considering the \"used - very good condition\" price point and the practically brand-new watch I received, this was an outstanding value. I'm incredibly happy with this purchase and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality smartwatch.",

Hasta all\u00ed todo bien, pero note que la bater\u00eda se agota muy r\u00e1pido  mientras lo configurada perdi\u00f3 mucho porcentaje.Edit: si quieren un reloj  para monitorear 24/7 este reloj no lo es, la autonom\u00eda es muy mal es el \u00fanico defecto  del reloj.",

        "review": "The watch was exactly what I wanted, close to it anyway.  Easy to set up using the app.  Instructions were easy so it was quick. The inter-changeable faces worked out well.  But the buttery life truly sucks. I might get 2 days before I have to charge it. I haven\u2019t had it on for a week. Love the watch, hate the battery life. If I had paid attention to another review and knowing what I know now, I wouldn\u2019t have bought it.",

Wouldn't charge, hard to connect etc.I have this for 4 days and so far it has been easier to use, no problems with connecting, holds the charge. I think it will require a daily charge but it charges fast so it's not problem for me.",

The watch did not have a protective film on the screen, box was open, you can see where sticker looks like it's been open multiple times and the box had lint in it. I would not recommend this item unless you are looking for used items.",
