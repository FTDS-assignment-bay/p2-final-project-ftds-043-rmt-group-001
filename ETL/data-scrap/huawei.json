I wear the D Watch for sleep in order to take my blood pressure throughout the night.  This product is one I wear during the day on days where I wear my silver Oura ring.  It is accurate and gorgeous.  On other days, I wear my Cyber GT with one of the multitude of bands and faces available for that watch.  I love Huawei.  But I only gave four stars for a couple reasons:  First, the APP has problems tracking three watches and tends to delete one of them when not in use.  Garmin would never do that and I hope Huawei fixes it.  Second, this GT-5 gets disconnected from the APP occasionally, which is aggravating.  Perhaps it is a problem with my bluetooth settings on my Pixel phone.  I will check.  But overall this is a great watch and -- knowing how great Huawei is -- I am sure it will ultimately fix the two bugs.",

It has almost all the functions you wished for a smart sports tracker and health monitor. The steps it counts is more than that of my iPhone watch 10, similar with Fitbit Charge 4. The good part is Huawei device can update the Steps in Apple Health but not other informations. I like the detail information it catches for swimming, including segments, charts and details. So does the Sleep monitor which provides detail graphic, description and analysis on the quality of your sleep. The sleep data are precise and accurate, even captures the nap minutes I take during a day. I captured a few shots of the watch screens as well as the a few ones from Huawei Health App. The sports activities in the watch only have a few common ones, no others, such table tennis, tennis, badminton or pickle ball, etc. the good part is you don\u2019t need subscription. In all, a great smart sports tracking device for a non-professional sport enthusiast. The quality and value over the price is very good.",

Looks/Material2. Responsive screen3. Love the closing mechanism of the wrist band (and the color...)4. Fairly impressive HRM. I've worn a chest HRM for comparison and generally impressed that the Huawei reacts to sudden exercise spurts or cool down as quickly and accurately as a chest strap - sometimes faster. But there are also times when it's totally off and it takes a couple minutes before it picks up the correct HR5. Love the training load, HRV, Recovery, VO2Max metrics6. I like that it has no GPS of its own. Makes the battery last longer and the watch will stream the GPS data from my phoneCON or NOT SO GREAT1. 1000's of watch faces - yet very few that are clean, modern, ergonomic. AND very few that can be customized. Thus no watch face that displays what I want and not what I don't want2. Often ridiculously small font, impossible to read without a magnifying glass3. A bit frustrating that some info is only on the watch, some only on the app4. As others pointed out, seems you can only start exercise via app, not via watch itself5. No Afib detection6. Very hard to find explanations of the metrics or how to adjust menus",

I've had the watch for a little over a month and it stopped being able to record laps correctly. I wasn't THAT upset because I still used it to monitor my heartrate in the pool. Instead of doing intervals strictly based on time, I was going by my heart rate. But then that function eventually broke too. Now it's a glorified step counter, but I suspect that feature might break soon as well. At that point it'll just be a watch with really limited features compared to higher end smart watches.",

Notifications are timely, fitness tracking is accurate, and the range of features feels thoughtful rather than bloated.The only drawback\u2014and it\u2019s worth noting\u2014is the limitation on downloading new watch faces if you\u2019re based in the U.S. That feature could add even more personalization, but even with the existing selection, it\u2019s still a joy to use.

I just don't see where other reviewers are having issues. The watch is awesome and the battery lasts a surprisingly long time compared to other watches I've tried.The only thing I recommend is, when you register everything, make sure to say you are in a different country besides the USA. If you register as from the US, you won't have access to the huge variety of face designs they have. But it's understandable, they haven't exactly been nice to Huawei. *shrug*",

Nonetheless less, I looove this smartwatch, I  use it every day and probably have only charged it twice in one month. Which when compared to my samsung and garmin smartwatches is amazing. The difference workout settings accurate step count, heart rate  monitoring etc., is fantastic. I would definitely recommend.  Setting up the watch was, takes some time 20 -30 minutes, because it is not supported in then play store. Once up and running, it is not short of amazing.",

        "review": "I have been wearing this watch for a full week and can honestly say this is way better than my older Apple Watch.  My Apple Watch 3 was going on 5 yrs old and was no longer holding a charge for more than 6 hours. I wanted a new smart watch but was hesitant to shell out $400 for a new Apple 10.  After a lot of research I decided to try the Huawei Fit 3 but I was concerned there were few reviews posted from a US based user.  So here\u2019s my take on this interesting watch:Pros:  1.  Amazing battery life.  After first full week of daily usage, battery was at 33%.  Let\u2019s see an Apple Watch match that.  2.  Seamless connection with my Apple 14 phone.  Leave the Health app open on your phone and it works perfectly.  I took a 2 mile walk with my new and old watches shortly after getting the Huawei, and both tracked the same exact distance .  3.  History of your exercise and health records tracks closely with those used by Apple.  Looks a bit different from Apple but the data is there.  4.  The watch face I have posted a photo of is great- it provides me with all the data I want on a smart watch on one screen- steps, bpm, weather, time,  date, battery life and  even Sp02.  5.  Price- I paid $155 for this watch and to me, this is a way better value than a $400 Apple 10.  6.  Accessories.  I purchased watch face covers and bands specific to the Fit 3 and they are interchangeable just like my old Apple 3.Cons:  No way to control your music or podcasts from the Huawei watch like you can on an Apple Watch.  For some folks, I can see why this could be a deal breaker, but not for me.I hope this review helps anyone considering this watch in the US.  After 1 full week, I have no regrets opting for the Huawei Fit 3 over other watches made by Apple, Garmin and Fitbit.  You get a lot more watch for a lot less $$$.",

There are only a handful of faces available with very ugly design since the App does not feature the \"Add watch faces\" option that is available for Android users, which seems unacceptable to me. I already updated the software of the watch to the last version and it's not the problem.Other thing that is bothering is that although the bracelet is made with great attention to detail, it does not allow to fine adjust it, so It can be very loose or very tight on your wrist. Seiko bracelets, a tenth percent of this quality, allow to do this.",

        "review": "First of all, the watch by itself looks gorgeous.  They could have been amazing in terms of functionality. But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label. Luckily I was able to return it.",

It would not connect to my phone , the strap was too large and uncomfortably odd with the  ceramic coating, the face was hard to read and a lot smaller than expected. I tried everything and the watch would not connect to my phone.  There are no instructions and what little there is does not reflect on the phone  and the watch lost power very quickly while trying to get it set up when it was stated that it has a battery life of 7 days. I only got 45 minutes.The pictures of the watch made it look way more elegant than it does in person.  The ceramic watch band looks strange and feels cold on the skin. The gold trim does not look gold, it looks more silvery with a hint of gold. Very disappointed. I never got a chance to try out the health features because it would not connect to my phone.",

It has almost all the functions you wished for a smart sports tracker and health monitor. The steps it counts is more than that of my iPhone watch 10, similar with Fitbit Charge 4. The good part is Huawei device can update the Steps in Apple Health but not other informations. I like the detail information it catches for swimming, including segments, charts and details. So does the Sleep monitor which provides detail graphic, description and analysis on the quality of your sleep. The sleep data are precise and accurate, even captures the nap minutes I take during a day. I captured a few shots of the watch screens as well as the a few ones from Huawei Health App. The sports activities in the watch only have a few common ones, no others, such table tennis, tennis, badminton or pickle ball, etc. the good part is you don\u2019t need subscription. In all, a great smart sports tracking device for a non-professional sport enthusiast. The quality and value over the price is very good.",

Looks/Material2. Responsive screen3. Love the closing mechanism of the wrist band (and the color...)4. Fairly impressive HRM. I've worn a chest HRM for comparison and generally impressed that the Huawei reacts to sudden exercise spurts or cool down as quickly and accurately as a chest strap - sometimes faster. But there are also times when it's totally off and it takes a couple minutes before it picks up the correct HR5. Love the training load, HRV, Recovery, VO2Max metrics6. I like that it has no GPS of its own. Makes the battery last longer and the watch will stream the GPS data from my phoneCON or NOT SO GREAT1. 1000's of watch faces - yet very few that are clean, modern, ergonomic. AND very few that can be customized. Thus no watch face that displays what I want and not what I don't want2. Often ridiculously small font, impossible to read without a magnifying glass3. A bit frustrating that some info is only on the watch, some only on the app4. As others pointed out, seems you can only start exercise via app, not via watch itself5. No Afib detection6. Very hard to find explanations of the metrics or how to adjust menus",

I've had the watch for a little over a month and it stopped being able to record laps correctly. I wasn't THAT upset because I still used it to monitor my heartrate in the pool. Instead of doing intervals strictly based on time, I was going by my heart rate. But then that function eventually broke too. Now it's a glorified step counter, but I suspect that feature might break soon as well. At that point it'll just be a watch with really limited features compared to higher end smart watches.",

Notifications are timely, fitness tracking is accurate, and the range of features feels thoughtful rather than bloated.The only drawback\u2014and it\u2019s worth noting\u2014is the limitation on downloading new watch faces if you\u2019re based in the U.S. That feature could add even more personalization, but even with the existing selection, it\u2019s still a joy to use.

        "review": "I love this watch. It's cheaper than any i-whatever, Android-friendly, and it does it's job. I have tattoos on my hands and wrists rendering most smart watches useless when it comes to reading my heart rate. But this watch actually does read it. I'm not sure how accurate it is, but at least I don't get the classic \"---\" reading.It's actually pretty easy to setup and get going. Maybe it's because I'm slightly tech-savvy? I don't know. I just don't see where other reviewers are having issues. The watch is awesome and the battery lasts a surprisingly long time compared to other watches I've tried.The only thing I recommend is, when you register everything, make sure to say you are in a different country besides the USA. If you register as from the US, you won't have access to the huge variety of face designs they have. But it's understandable, they haven't exactly been nice to Huawei. *shrug*",

Nonetheless less, I looove this smartwatch, I  use it every day and probably have only charged it twice in one month. Which when compared to my samsung and garmin smartwatches is amazing. The difference workout settings accurate step count, heart rate  monitoring etc., is fantastic. I would definitely recommend.  Setting up the watch was, takes some time 20 -30 minutes, because it is not supported in then play store. Once up and running, it is not short of amazing.",

        "review": "I have been wearing this watch for a full week and can honestly say this is way better than my older Apple Watch.  My Apple Watch 3 was going on 5 yrs old and was no longer holding a charge for more than 6 hours. I wanted a new smart watch but was hesitant to shell out $400 for a new Apple 10.  After a lot of research I decided to try the Huawei Fit 3 but I was concerned there were few reviews posted from a US based user.  So here\u2019s my take on this interesting watch:Pros:  1.  Amazing battery life.  After first full week of daily usage, battery was at 33%.  Let\u2019s see an Apple Watch match that.  2.  Seamless connection with my Apple 14 phone.  Leave the Health app open on your phone and it works perfectly.  I took a 2 mile walk with my new and old watches shortly after getting the Huawei, and both tracked the same exact distance .  3.  History of your exercise and health records tracks closely with those used by Apple.  Looks a bit different from Apple but the data is there.  4.  The watch face I have posted a photo of is great- it provides me with all the data I want on a smart watch on one screen- steps, bpm, weather, time,  date, battery life and  even Sp02.  5.  Price- I paid $155 for this watch and to me, this is a way better value than a $400 Apple 10.  6.  Accessories.  I purchased watch face covers and bands specific to the Fit 3 and they are interchangeable just like my old Apple 3.Cons:  No way to control your music or podcasts from the Huawei watch like you can on an Apple Watch.  For some folks, I can see why this could be a deal breaker, but not for me.I hope this review helps anyone considering this watch in the US.  After 1 full week, I have no regrets opting for the Huawei Fit 3 over other watches made by Apple, Garmin and Fitbit.  You get a lot more watch for a lot less $$$.",

There are only a handful of faces available with very ugly design since the App does not feature the \"Add watch faces\" option that is available for Android users, which seems unacceptable to me. I already updated the software of the watch to the last version and it's not the problem.Other thing that is bothering is that although the bracelet is made with great attention to detail, it does not allow to fine adjust it, so It can be very loose or very tight on your wrist. Seiko bracelets, a tenth percent of this quality, allow to do this.",

        "review": "First of all, the watch by itself looks gorgeous.  They could have been amazing in terms of functionality. But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label. Luckily I was able to return it.",

Heart rate is on point, and there are tons of extra features.  You can set it up for almost any type of exercise that you do.  From walking on the treadmill, to walking outside.  Running, strength training, lap swimming, elliptical, rowing machine, you name it.  The weather is accurate on this as well.  It's just a beautiful watch.  For the rest of us, we don't need that Apple watch with the high price tag.  This watch is superior, and the price is right.  Another bonus, the charge lasts for days.  I need to charge mine tonight, after not charging it for 9 days.  This brand will forever be my go to.  I research EVERYTHING thoroughly, and after having bought a Garmin to give it a go, that thing was a hunk of junk.  I came across this one, read the reviews, and felt confident with my purchase.  You will not be sorry you bought this.  I can't tell you how many people I've told about this watch.",

The first thing that impressed me was the battery life \u2013 it actually lasts for 10 days without needing daily charging. This is a huge plus for those who don\u2019t want to worry about charging all the time.All the trackers work flawlessly: sleep monitoring, heart rate tracking, and sports modes \u2013 everything is accurate and reliable. The watch is comfortable, lightweight, and stylish, fitting perfectly on the wrist. The built-in GPS maps with navigation are a great bonus, making workouts and travel easier.I\u2019m really happy with my purchase and can confidently recommend this smartwatch to my friends and acquaintances.

I didn\u2019t expect it to be this good - it truly feels like a quality purchase.The watch face is a bit on the larger side, so it feels slightly more masculine and may be better suited for men - but I still really enjoy using it. Even though it\u2019s a bit big for me, the strap adjusts perfectly and makes it comfortable to wear.Funny enough, I forgot I had it on and accidentally took a shower with it - but nothing happened!

But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label. Luckily I was able to return it.",

I always buy new, but lost my GW4 with cellular in the ocean. I temporarily settled for a GW5 without cellular, and quickly missed the freedom of not having to carry my phone everywhere, so I decided to give it a try.The setup with ATT was flawless. I was so excited I didn't have to call to get the cellular setup. I was able to get the number sync setup as well. This watch has performed like new. The only issue is, since it's a Tizen platform the updates are no longer supported. I think it's using like a V2.0. Don't get me wrong, it's not running turtle speed, just some apps are not available to download because Android no longer uses the Tizen platform.With all that said, I would definitely purchase this watch again #G3!",

The battery is better as well. I also like the larger face size. Being able to customize the watch face to my specific needs was essential, and I can do this with this watch. I did have to buy a program to do that, but it was well worth the $20. Facemaker is the name of the program if other's want to do the same. I get a full week use out of the battery with 4 1 hour (average) workouts a week. I actually have about 20% left at the 1 week point. Heart rate seems to be accurate, although it only checks it once a minute (settable in the app). For workouts it seems to display heart rate in real time which I care about more than when I am not working out. The app that the watch uses is pretty good. It actually provides a LOT more information than I care about. The only thing I have found that I wish was better is having the ability to edit the workout face. You can edit the data and where that data displays, but you can't edit the size of each data display. I would really like to be able to do this. Even better would be the ability to edit the workout face in the app, as opposed to only on the watch. I have only had this a couple of weeks so there may be more I discover that I like or dislike. I will update if needed, but for now I can fully recommend this watch as a valid replacement for much higher priced watches.",

Setting up the watch is really easy and they connect via Bluetooth. Since I love working out, this is one of the features that I really enjoyed. It has more than 140 workouts something that the other smart watches do not have and it\u2019s at a fraction of the cost, which makes it even better. There\u2019s also an app that you can download that allows you to monitor your food intake. One of the great functions that this watch has is the ability to make and receive phone calls as well as text messages. A battery life on the watch is amazing. You can get up to 14 days depending on your usage. This is something I was not able to accomplish with my other smart watch.",

My Fitbit would last well over a week before it needed a charge. I do like that you can text and answer calls from your arm. The charging port could be a bit more user convenient. It was simple to connect this watch to my Android; it's compatible. Just make sure you go in to set the language to English. Also, you must download the app. I like the black color.

It\u2019s user friendly and easy to see notifications on the display, even in bright daylight. It is water resistant and very durable. I tend to break the screen of my other watches and this one is holding up strong! It even offers AI coaching for fitness. You can choose from tons of face watches to match your personal style. The screen size looks a little large for my small wrist but it doesn\u2019t feel bulky when on. Overall this watch is amazing.

I just don't see where other reviewers are having issues. The watch is awesome and the battery lasts a surprisingly long time compared to other watches I've tried.The only thing I recommend is, when you register everything, make sure to say you are in a different country besides the USA. If you register as from the US, you won't have access to the huge variety of face designs they have. But it's understandable, they haven't exactly been nice to Huawei. *shrug*",

My Apple Watch 3 was going on 5 yrs old and was no longer holding a charge for more than 6 hours. I wanted a new smart watch but was hesitant to shell out $400 for a new Apple 10.  After a lot of research I decided to try the Huawei Fit 3 but I was concerned there were few reviews posted from a US based user.  So here\u2019s my take on this interesting watch:Pros:  1.  Amazing battery life.  After first full week of daily usage, battery was at 33%.  Let\u2019s see an Apple Watch match that.  2.  Seamless connection with my Apple 14 phone.  Leave the Health app open on your phone and it works perfectly.  I took a 2 mile walk with my new and old watches shortly after getting the Huawei, and both tracked the same exact distance .  3.  History of your exercise and health records tracks closely with those used by Apple.  Looks a bit different from Apple but the data is there.  4.  The watch face I have posted a photo of is great- it provides me with all the data I want on a smart watch on one screen- steps, bpm, weather, time,  date, battery life and  even Sp02.  5.  Price- I paid $155 for this watch and to me, this is a way better value than a $400 Apple 10.  6.  Accessories.  I purchased watch face covers and bands specific to the Fit 3 and they are interchangeable just like my old Apple 3.Cons:  No way to control your music or podcasts from the Huawei watch like you can on an Apple Watch.  For some folks, I can see why this could be a deal breaker, but not for me.I hope this review helps anyone considering this watch in the US.  After 1 full week, I have no regrets opting for the Huawei Fit 3 over other watches made by Apple, Garmin and Fitbit.  You get a lot more watch for a lot less $$$.",

I need to charge mine tonight, after not charging it for 9 days.  This brand will forever be my go to.  I research EVERYTHING thoroughly, and after having bought a Garmin to give it a go, that thing was a hunk of junk.  I came across this one, read the reviews, and felt confident with my purchase.  You will not be sorry you bought this.  I can't tell you how many people I've told about this watch.",

The first thing that impressed me was the battery life \u2013 it actually lasts for 10 days without needing daily charging. This is a huge plus for those who don\u2019t want to worry about charging all the time.All the trackers work flawlessly: sleep monitoring, heart rate tracking, and sports modes \u2013 everything is accurate and reliable. The watch is comfortable, lightweight, and stylish, fitting perfectly on the wrist. The built-in GPS maps with navigation are a great bonus, making workouts and travel easier.I\u2019m really happy with my purchase and can confidently recommend this smartwatch to my friends and acquaintances. If you\u2019re looking for a smartwatch with long battery life, high-quality tracking, and great functionality, the Amazfit Active 2 is definitely worth considering!",

It looks so elegant on the wrist, and the quality feels amazing.There are so many useful features - one workout function alone has multiple training modes where you can track calories, plus detailed sleep tracking, notifications, and even a flashlight. I didn\u2019t expect it to be this good - it truly feels like a quality purchase.The watch face is a bit on the larger side, so it feels slightly more masculine and may be better suited for men - but I still really enjoy using it. Even though it\u2019s a bit big for me, the strap adjusts perfectly and makes it comfortable to wear.Funny enough, I forgot I had it on and accidentally took a shower with it - but nothing happened! The watch was totally fine. It even has a water cleaning mode, which is such a smart touch. Highly recommend!",

My previous smartwatch was a Garmin Fenix 6 which is heavier and rugged.  It looks great, has a bright screen, and paired easily with my Google Pixel 6 Pro phone.  The only concerns/issues I have are: (1) because the watch is so lightweight, I'm concerned about it durability...definitely would not wear it in the garage while fixing things; (2) when paired with Pandora music app, the watch vibrates/notifies me every time the song changes no matter if its via my phone or car...I hope that maybe a setting change can fix this.  Overall, great smartwatch for normal everyday life and workouts but probably not the one for extreme sports and in the garage wear.",

It has almost all the functions you wished for a smart sports tracker and health monitor. The steps it counts is more than that of my iPhone watch 10, similar with Fitbit Charge 4. The good part is Huawei device can update the Steps in Apple Health but not other informations. I like the detail information it catches for swimming, including segments, charts and details. So does the Sleep monitor which provides detail graphic, description and analysis on the quality of your sleep. The sleep data are precise and accurate, even captures the nap minutes I take during a day. I captured a few shots of the watch screens as well as the a few ones from Huawei Health App. The sports activities in the watch only have a few common ones, no others, such table tennis, tennis, badminton or pickle ball, etc. the good part is you don\u2019t need subscription. In all, a great smart sports tracking device for a non-professional sport enthusiast. The quality and value over the price is very good.",

Looks/Material2. Responsive screen3. Love the closing mechanism of the wrist band (and the color...)4. Fairly impressive HRM. I've worn a chest HRM for comparison and generally impressed that the Huawei reacts to sudden exercise spurts or cool down as quickly and accurately as a chest strap - sometimes faster. But there are also times when it's totally off and it takes a couple minutes before it picks up the correct HR5. Love the training load, HRV, Recovery, VO2Max metrics6. I like that it has no GPS of its own. Makes the battery last longer and the watch will stream the GPS data from my phoneCON or NOT SO GREAT1. 1000's of watch faces - yet very few that are clean, modern, ergonomic. AND very few that can be customized. Thus no watch face that displays what I want and not what I don't want2. Often ridiculously small font, impossible to read without a magnifying glass3. A bit frustrating that some info is only on the watch, some only on the app4. As others pointed out, seems you can only start exercise via app, not via watch itself5. No Afib detection6.

I've had the watch for a little over a month and it stopped being able to record laps correctly. I wasn't THAT upset because I still used it to monitor my heartrate in the pool. Instead of doing intervals strictly based on time, I was going by my heart rate. But then that function eventually broke too. Now it's a glorified step counter, but I suspect that feature might break soon as well. At that point it'll just be a watch with really limited features compared to higher end smart watches.",

My last one was about 5 years old and the battery was terrible - I literally had to charge it throughout the day just to get through. My boyfriend and I got each other this watch for Christmas and they were easy to set up. So far the battery life is awesome. Day 2 and I\u2019m still at 83%. My phone notifications - text and calls come through fine. I never really replied to text on my watch so I just use my phone. I think for the money the value is awesome - so much cheaper than an Apple Watch and has all of the same qualities! The screen size is big but very clear and super comfortable to wear. So far I am very happy! Now I have only had for 2 days so I will come back to update but so far so so happy with the purchase!",

I already updated the software of the watch to the last version and it's not the problem.Other thing that is bothering is that although the bracelet is made with great attention to detail, it does not allow to fine adjust it, so It can be very loose or very tight on your wrist.

But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label. Luckily I was able to return it.",

It has almost all the functions you wished for a smart sports tracker and health monitor. The steps it counts is more than that of my iPhone watch 10, similar with Fitbit Charge 4. The good part is Huawei device can update the Steps in Apple Health but not other informations. I like the detail information it catches for swimming, including segments, charts and details. So does the Sleep monitor which provides detail graphic, description and analysis on the quality of your sleep. The sleep data are precise and accurate, even captures the nap minutes I take during a day. I captured a few shots of the watch screens as well as the a few ones from Huawei Health App. The sports activities in the watch only have a few common ones, no others, such table tennis, tennis, badminton or pickle ball, etc. the good part is you don\u2019t need subscription. In all, a great smart sports tracking device for a non-professional sport enthusiast. The quality and value over the price is very good.",

Looks/Material2. Responsive screen3. Love the closing mechanism of the wrist band (and the color...)4. Fairly impressive HRM. I've worn a chest HRM for comparison and generally impressed that the Huawei reacts to sudden exercise spurts or cool down as quickly and accurately as a chest strap - sometimes faster. But there are also times when it's totally off and it takes a couple minutes before it picks up the correct HR5. Love the training load, HRV, Recovery, VO2Max metrics6. I like that it has no GPS of its own. Makes the battery last longer and the watch will stream the GPS data from my phoneCON or NOT SO GREAT1. 1000's of watch faces - yet very few that are clean, modern, ergonomic. AND very few that can be customized. Thus no watch face that displays what I want and not what I don't want2. Often ridiculously small font, impossible to read without a magnifying glass3. A bit frustrating that some info is only on the watch, some only on the app4. As others pointed out, seems you can only start exercise via app, not via watch itself5. No Afib detection6. Very hard to find explanations of the metrics or how to adjust menus",

I've had the watch for a little over a month and it stopped being able to record laps correctly. I wasn't THAT upset because I still used it to monitor my heartrate in the pool. Instead of doing intervals strictly based on time, I was going by my heart rate. But then that function eventually broke too. Now it's a glorified step counter, but I suspect that feature might break soon as well. At that point it'll just be a watch with really limited features compared to higher end smart watches.",

Vengo de usar el Samsung Gear Frontier desde el 2016 hasta este a\u00f1o asique me daba un poco de miedo cambiar de marca.  Es incomparable la duracion de la bateria.. los dos dias de samsungs vs. 2 semanas casi enteras es incre\u00edble sin perder el ser un reloj casual, y sin llegar a los Garmin que se especializan en deportes. Me gustaba mas el men\u00fa radial del Frontier y la corona para trabajar. pero te acostumbras al nuevo men\u00fa y a manejarte con el bot\u00f3n giratorio.2 cosas me molestan \u00fanicamente, no tiene wifi, asique es dependiente de la conexi\u00f3n bluethoo con el celular.. lo cual es una cagada, por que capaz que dejas el celu cargando y se desconecta, siendo que se podr\u00eda conectar a la red del hogar. y la segunda.. esa est\u00fapida postura de las empresas de cerrarse en su universo. por ejemplo para usar el disparador de c\u00e1mara remota Tenes que bajarte la c\u00e1mara de Huawei... que para Samsung es paga o llena de propaganda..lo mismo con las appsFuera de estas dos situaciones.. anda muyy lindo y muy bien logrado.",

I already updated the software of the watch to the last version and it's not the problem.Other thing that is bothering is that although the bracelet is made with great attention to detail, it does not allow to fine adjust it, so It can be very loose or very tight on your wrist. Seiko bracelets, a tenth percent of this quality, allow to do this.",

But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label. Luckily I was able to return it.",

        "review": "I purchased this watch to replace a dead Samsung Galaxy watch.I've been pleasantly surprised with the functionality for the price. This watch will display and respond to messages, answer calls, track workouts, and more. I'm extremely surprised by the battery life. Wearing this watch for a week and the battery is only 50%. No more charging every night. A long with the great features you get a stylish and comfortable watch. Easy to read no matter the light.I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who wants the modern convenience of a smart watch for a fraction of the name brand price.",

        "review": "Pleasantly surprised. Finally, a less expensive watch that does everything, and more, than my Fitbit did. It has all the features I used on Fitbit for half the cost. The battery is better as well. I also like the larger face size. Being able to customize the watch face to my specific needs was essential, and I can do this with this watch. I did have to buy a program to do that, but it was well worth the $20. Facemaker is the name of the program if other's want to do the same. I get a full week use out of the battery with 4 1 hour (average) workouts a week. I actually have about 20% left at the 1 week point. Heart rate seems to be accurate, although it only checks it once a minute (settable in the app). For workouts it seems to display heart rate in real time which I care about more than when I am not working out. The app that the watch uses is pretty good. It actually provides a LOT more information than I care about. The only thing I have found that I wish was better is having the ability to edit the workout face. You can edit the data and where that data displays, but you can't edit the size of each data display. I would really like to be able to do this. Even better would be the ability to edit the workout face in the app, as opposed to only on the watch. I have only had this a couple of weeks so there may be more I discover that I like or dislike. I will update if needed, but for now I can fully recommend this watch as a valid replacement for much higher priced watches.",

        "review": "If you\u2019re looking to purchase a smart watch that is affordable and it has all the bills and whistles other smart watches have then check this out. If you have an android or an iPhone, no worries this watch is actually compatible with both. You can also monitor your heart rate, steps taken and so much more. Setting up the watch is really easy and they connect via Bluetooth. Since I love working out, this is one of the features that I really enjoyed. It has more than 140 workouts something that the other smart watches do not have and it\u2019s at a fraction of the cost, which makes it even better. There\u2019s also an app that you can download that allows you to monitor your food intake. One of the great functions that this watch has is the ability to make and receive phone calls as well as text messages. A battery life on the watch is amazing. You can get up to 14 days depending on your usage. This is something I was not able to accomplish with my other smart watch.",

        "review": "This watch does well, considered the price. The functions and capabilities are pretty good. The watch face is a nice size for those who need larger texts. The band width is a bit snug. I wish they'd offer larger bands. My major squarm is the battery life when active. The watch has to be charged every four days. My Fitbit would last well over a week before it needed a charge. I do like that you can text and answer calls from your arm. The charging port could be a bit more user convenient. It was simple to connect this watch to my Android; it's compatible. Just make sure you go in to set the language to English. Also, you must download the app. I like the black color. The watch face is easily scratched though. I swam with it and it did well. Overall, it's a pretty decent watch.",

        "review": "This watch is amazing quality for the price! I have smart watches from all the major competitors and this one is actually better than all of them. The long battery life is a huge reason why I love this watch. I have had it on for weeks and it\u2019s still at 1/2 battery level. It\u2019s functional and has everything that you could want in a smart watch, and more. You can get all your notifications on this watch, GPS, make phone calls, and send replies. It has so many health tracking features like different workout modes, sleep metrics, blood oxygen, stress, and heart rate. It\u2019s user friendly and easy to see notifications on the display, even in bright daylight. It is water resistant and very durable. I tend to break the screen of my other watches and this one is holding up strong! It even offers AI coaching for fitness. You can choose from tons of face watches to match your personal style. The screen size looks a little large for my small wrist but it doesn\u2019t feel bulky when on. Overall this watch is amazing. If you are looking to get a smart watch I would definitely recommend this one; yes even over the leading brands. Oh and there is no subscription fee!",
