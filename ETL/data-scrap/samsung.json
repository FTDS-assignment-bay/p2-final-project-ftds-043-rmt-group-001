        "review": "My Galaxy (4) watch was ready for an upgrade!I always do my research and read the reviews before I buy a product. This purchase was no different. I was somewhat concerned with a number of reviewers complaining that the battery was not good and didn't last long. So, I want to address that concern first.With all of my watches I never use the Always on Display function. I realize that the watch faces are beautiful on the Galaxy Screen. However, those beautiful bright LED's use power. If you leave them on all the time you can expect maximum battery drain. I have everything turned on except the AOD. Yesterday I used my watch a lot as I was playing and experimenting with all the cool features. Wore it through the night to monitor my sleep. This morning at 6 a.m. I had used a total of 27 percent of battery power for a 24 hour period! At this rate of power usage I can expect 3+ days of use. Battery life doesn't concern me at all.SETUP (Stars*****)I was expecting to make a trip to my service provider because I use the LTE version. I figured I could do all the setup minus the phone provider portion at home. I was extremely impressed with the setup/switch procedure. Simple, straight forward and quick!I was pleased at how simple and easy the setup was. As soon as I was done I needed to let my dogs out for a walk. While I was out walking the girls my Watch rang! I answered it and had a nice conversation. The switch feature swapped over and set up all of my LTE functions without the need to spend half a day at my phone providers location!DIGITAL RING VERSUS PHYSICAL (Stars *****)I never really liked the physical ring all that much. The new digital ring is awesome! Good job Samsung!CHARGING (Stars *****)Charges extremely fast with the little charger that comes with the watch. This small charger is great for travel. I ordered a couple more.FITNESS (Stars *****)I'm still using them and can only say that so far they are still the award winning excersize App/sensors they have always been.AI (Stars *****)Wow! This opens up a whole new experience with my watch. I use Alexa to do so many things now. The ability to put Alexa on my watch is a real game changer. Don't worry, if you prefer Google assistant you can use that as well.ASTHETICS (Stars *****)I think Samsung could have done a better job with the advertisement pics out there. I was initially disappointed at how the Galaxy 7 looked. When I actually got the watch I happily realized the pics don't do it justice. I think that this is the most aesthetically pleasing watch Samsung has made to date.THE BAND (Stars ***)Nope. I knew I didn't like the watch band it comes with from the pics. If you want an extra you can have mine. I ordered a watch band from Wingle to match the silver of the watch. Wow! They are a perfect match and look gorgeous!I couldn't be happier! What a great Smartwatch. When you pair this watch with the Samsung family of devices it is in a class of it's own!OVERALL: Five Stars!RECOMMEND?: Absolutely YES!",

It\u2019s not just functional but truly a piece of wearable art.Performance and Features: Smarter Than EverThe Galaxy Watch 7 runs on a smooth, responsive interface, powered by Samsung\u2019s Tizen OS, which provides seamless integration with both Android and iOS devices.

I can easily go through a full day of workouts, notifications, and sleep tracking without worrying about running out of juice.Health & Fitness Tracking: Comprehensive and AccurateSamsung\u2019s health and fitness tracking capabilities on the Galaxy Watch 7 are excellent. It tracks a wide range of activities, from running and cycling to yoga and strength training, and offers detailed insights on heart rate, calories burned, and even advanced metrics like VO2 max. The built-in GPS is accurate for outdoor workouts, and I\u2019ve found the heart rate sensor to be incredibly precise during both intense workouts and calmer activities like walking or stretching.One of the most useful features is the Energy Score. It uses AI and real-time data to provide a daily \"score\" based on your physical activity, sleep patterns, and recovery time. This is a game-changer if you\u2019re looking to optimize your fitness routine or get a better understanding of your overall energy balance throughout the day.Sleep tracking is another area where the Galaxy Watch 7 excels. It offers detailed insights into sleep cycles (light, deep, REM) and provides suggestions for improving sleep quality, which I found helpful for maintaining my overall well-being.Smart Features and Connectivity: Seamless IntegrationThe Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and the ability to take calls directly from the watch without needing to reach for your phone is incredibly convenient. You can also stream music via Spotify or store offline playlists for runs or workouts without having to carry your phone. The built-in Bixby voice assistant works well, though I found it to be a little slower than on my phone. That said, it\u2019s great for quick commands or hands-free tasks.The watch supports NFC for Samsung Pay, making it easy to tap and pay when I\u2019m on the go\u2014super convenient for those times when I forget my wallet or phone.Final Thoughts: The Smartwatch to BeatOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Bespoke Edition 44mm Bluetooth AI Smartwatch with Energy Score is an exceptional wearable that blends high-end design with advanced health and fitness tracking. The customizable look is perfect for anyone who wants a watch that\u2019s as much a fashion accessory as a fitness tool, and the AI-powered insights, especially the Energy Score, make it one of the most intuitive and effective smartwatches I\u2019ve used.Whether you\u2019re looking to boost your workouts, improve your sleep, or just have a stylish smartwatch that keeps you connected, the Galaxy Watch 7 Bespoke Edition delivers it all. If you\u2019re in the market for a top-tier smartwatch, this is definitely one worth considering.",

I can say that they both, for me, do exactly what I want. The Galaxy however, to me personally, is the better looker and is less buggy. I have not had to shut it down because of any freezing, or glitches. It has tracked my workouts great, and the battery is really good. However, I don't believe the battery life is better than my apple watch, but close. I am an active person, so my watch gets used much. I recommend the galaxy watch ultra to anyone who is on the fence about getting one. If you don't mind big watches, and you track your runs, calories, and any workouts, I don't see you going wrong by picking one up. Just remember that every use case is different because we are all different.",

It\u2019s bright, sharp, and responsive, making it easy to read notifications, track fitness stats, and navigate apps even in direct sunlight.

The LTE connectivity is a standout feature for me\u2014I can leave my phone behind and still make calls, send texts, stream music, and even use GPS navigation seamlessly. It\u2019s perfect for runs, hikes, or even just quick errands without being tied to my phone.When it comes to health and fitness tracking, the AI-powered sensors are incredibly accurate and insightful. The heart rate monitoring, SpO2 sensor, advanced sleep analysis, and ECG capabilities make it feel like having a personal health assistant on my wrist. I love the detailed workout modes that adapt based on my activities, providing real-time feedback and post-workout analysis that helps me track progress effectively. The GPS is also impressively accurate, which is a must for my outdoor runs and cycling sessions.Battery life was a pleasant surprise, considering all the features packed into this watch. I can easily get two full days of use with LTE, GPS, and continuous health monitoring enabled. When I do need to recharge, the fast-charging feature gets me back to full power quickly, which is a huge plus for someone constantly on the move.Another aspect I appreciate is the integration with Samsung\u2019s ecosystem.

The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic I received was near mint, cosmetically flawless, and has been running perfectly after several weeks of daily use.I was expecting to see some telltale signs of refurb wear like battery drain, slow charging, or connectivity issues.. I\u2019ve experienced none of that. Battery life is solid, the LTE and Bluetooth connections are stable, and everything works exactly as intended.The rotating bezel is easily one of the best parts of the experience\u2014responsive, smooth, and satisfying to use. The watch is comfortable on the wrist and packed with features like HR zones, sleep tracking, and health insights that all seem to function without hiccups. I actually liked it so much I bought one for my wife too. it hasn\u2019t left her wrist since.What Could Be Better:The OEM watch band is the weakest part of the setup. It gets the job done, but it feels cheap and lacks comfort. I'd recommend upgrading to a quality aftermarket band to really round out the experience.Bottom Line:For a renewed device, this exceeded all expectations. Near-new condition, reliable function, and all the smart features working as advertised. If you\u2019re on the fence about buying this renewed, don\u2019t be. Just plan to grab a better band, and you\u2019re set.",

The larger Super AMOLED display offers generous real estate for maps, workouts, and quick replies while looking absolutely sharp under bright California sun. The physical rotating bezel returns as the crown jewel, giving precise, tactile control that never smudges the screen.Performance is snappy thanks to Samsung\u2019s newest Exynos W930 chipset paired with 2 GB of RAM, so apps launch instantly and tiles scroll without stutter. Battery life stretches to a full 40 hours even with always-on display and frequent heart-rate checks. A quick thirty-minute top-up on the included fast charger easily carries me through the next day.Health features are where the watch earns its keep.

The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic I received was near mint, cosmetically flawless, and has been running perfectly after several weeks of daily use.I was expecting to see some telltale signs of refurb wear like battery drain, slow charging, or connectivity issues.. I\u2019ve experienced none of that. Battery life is solid, the LTE and Bluetooth connections are stable, and everything works exactly as intended.The rotating bezel is easily one of the best parts of the experience\u2014responsive, smooth, and satisfying to use. The watch is comfortable on the wrist and packed with features like HR zones, sleep tracking, and health insights that all seem to function without hiccups. I actually liked it so much I bought one for my wife too. it hasn\u2019t left her wrist since.What Could Be Better:The OEM watch band is the weakest part of the setup. It gets the job done, but it feels cheap and lacks comfort. I'd recommend upgrading to a quality aftermarket band to really round out the experience.Bottom Line:For a renewed device, this exceeded all expectations. Near-new condition, reliable function, and all the smart features working as advertised. If you\u2019re on the fence about buying this renewed, don\u2019t be. Just plan to grab a better band, and you\u2019re set.",

If you spend this much money, at least get Facer or in my opinion you've wasted your money,  cause the faces is where it's at for me. I was certain I didn't need the lte but would have gotten it for sure if I knew than what I know now. I have no regrets just would have gotten it. I love the black, but sort of wish I would have gone with silver cause of the bands you can buy. It's a very good feeling watch nice and heavy.Change the band immediately unless you like to live in discomfort and protect the bezel not the screen. Trust me and if you insist on screen protector the inner are you will put it on is like bevel or cone shaped so if the glass isn't you'll regret it \ud83e\udd2d add tons of music and pictures easy to use and change. Turn your notifications sound to vibrate and minimal sounds or when it gets to updates you'll be a very noisy fellow. And turn your screen to AOD and only push button to wake. Battery is good but not for the first month when it's figuring out your usage patterns I wish you can adjust the speed with your bezel turn you have to turn it like one whole rotation to scroll like 3/4\" of page and also the direction. For some reason I'd rather turn it the other direction. Watch is a 5/5 still but dont expect it to be miraculous. It's just a watch with smart features and incredible if you  are into fitness which I'm not. Love how it works when I jump on my bike and when I'm off it's very accurate with steps and bike riding.Spend the money and buy something you will use everyday. We'll worth it for the price. Get it used if you can or you'll spend like 40 bux for the price of Tape you'll cut anyway\ud83e\udee3",

Its durable and connects easily via bluetooth.

I obviously can't go too far away from my phone or my bluetooth will disconnect and I can't use the call/texts features BUT the reach is pretty far I have never had an issue. I can text and answer calls even with my phone being in the other room. I also LOVE this \"find my phone\" feature when I misplace my phone (which is often).

        "review": "really wanted to keep this watch as the 40 mm size was perfect and loved the features.My use case was very simple, using it as a stand alone cycling fitness tracker that syncs to Strava fitness app.  I wanted it to record my miles ridden with gps and also leave my phone at home and still be able to make phone calls in case of emergency. Everything was working fine even though the miles tracked with gps were about a tenth of a mile off from my phone for every ten miles ridden. I could tell from the gps map of my ride using both the watch and the phone that my phone was able to track more accurately. There was less variability in the gps signal.Ok, so I could live with gps being off by a mile over a 100 mile bike ride.I was also comfortable with the battery life. Seemed like I could get a good 7hours or more using cellular, gps tracking, and data service. The rest of my day I didn't even wear the watch.The deal breaker for me was the lack of external heart rate monitor support.Shocker!  I have seen reviews saying how the heart rate tracking for the samsungs weren't that good and I had an external polar heart rate monitor I wanted to use. Well, I could not do that. I could not get my motorola phone to recognize the HR Monitor via bluetooth. I researched some and found some people had luck getting it to work with a little effort but only with a Samsung phone. Mine was a motorola.Sorry, but I need an external hr sensor so that was the deal breaker since I know the google pixel watch and the apple watches support that.If you're not picky like me and can live with the less accurate heart rate tracking built  into the watch then it's a great device and probably the best android based watch. I really didn't want to have to move to the apple eco system just for a watch.",

        "review": "I've had a 4 Classic since 2021 and there's enough to like about it that I haven't seen a watch I'd rather have. The battery life is the biggest downside. You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit. A black band would put more focus on the watch itself.",

I paid 400 when this watch released back In 2021, It got water damage. Then I decided to buy this refurbished watch, it was great but I lost it in a week, but Keep in mind it didnt come with the original cable, but that was okay to me because I still have the original cable from the other watch, and if youre wondering. Yes, it has the same charging speed. So after I lost the watch, I decided to buy it again. Make sure to turn on remote protecting & anti theft, and turn on Location sharing so other people can find your watch if you lose it. And try to keep it away from water if you want it to last you a long time, we dont really know how good that refubrished waterproof seal is, but even my brand new one is bought on release got water damage after a few months, so just keep it away from water if you want it to last a couple years.Final thoughts, just buy it, its 60 and the perfect balance between functionality and price, or you can wait 4 years until today's top of the line Samsung watches sell for under 100, Your choice!",

        "review": "I'm very much enjoying this watch.  I refuse to spend much money on a watch, so when this went on sale at a bargain price, I went for it.  I came from an Amazfit that was starting to annoy my by refusing to do alerts.  This Samsung watch is a couple of generations old and is refurbished.  I cannot tell that is isn't brand new, and everything works well.  I have a Samsung phone, so using the Samsung Wear app and syncing to the watch was super easy.  Battery life is great - I'm at 75% after using it all day (no way am I going to be wanting to sleep with a watch on!).  The step count is accurate.  Setting what apps to alert was easy.  The display is nice and bright.  I haven't bothered with EKG or other body measurements - I care about step counts.  Along with that it purports to measure activity and calories expended - I have no way to know if they're accurate...  Anyway, bottom line - I'm very happy with this watch!",

My previous smart watch was a Samsung, so I knew basic stuff about how to/what to. The watch did come with a quick start guide and a charger, both very nice to have. It has all the same bells and whistles I was used to, plus more. I actually used the flashlight feature last night while my tiny was sleeping so I could move around without turning a light on, and that worked great. The battery isn't too bad for my purposes. I got 2 days out of it, but I tracked steps and sleep only. I did blood oxygen, and that depleted my battery pretty quick, but I just wanted to see what it was like. Neat feature, but not one I need. Anyway, it's on par with what my non-refurbished old watch used to get, so I'm very happy about that.The battery was dead when it arrived, but I got it charging and used my phone to do most of my set-up while it juiced. The other nice thing was a lot of my stuff transferred from my old watch to the new, so I didn't have to add back my alarms and stuff. That was swell. I also like that the watch can do sound alarms, and they're not super annoying or obtrusive.All-in-all, good watch. Happy I took a chance on the refurbished. And the size is just perfect for me, too.I did manage to scratch it already (I just got it this past weekish), but I have a toddler and I'm a klutz, so that's probably my doing anyway.I would like to suggest NEVER taking it swimming, or even in the shower, even though there's tracking for swimming and a \"water lock\".

If you spend this much money, at least get Facer or in my opinion you've wasted your money,  cause the faces is where it's at for me. I was certain I didn't need the lte but would have gotten it for sure if I knew than what I know now. I have no regrets just would have gotten it. I love the black, but sort of wish I would have gone with silver cause of the bands you can buy. It's a very good feeling watch nice and heavy.Change the band immediately unless you like to live in discomfort and protect the bezel not the screen. Trust me and if you insist on screen protector the inner are you will put it on is like bevel or cone shaped so if the glass isn't you'll regret it \ud83e\udd2d add tons of music and pictures easy to use and change. Turn your notifications sound to vibrate and minimal sounds or when it gets to updates you'll be a very noisy fellow. And turn your screen to AOD and only push button to wake. Battery is good but not for the first month when it's figuring out your usage patterns I wish you can adjust the speed with your bezel turn you have to turn it like one whole rotation to scroll like 3/4\" of page and also the direction. For some reason I'd rather turn it the other direction. Watch is a 5/5 still but dont expect it to be miraculous. It's just a watch with smart features and incredible if you  are into fitness which I'm not. Love how it works when I jump on my bike and when I'm off it's very accurate with steps and bike riding.Spend the money and buy something you will use everyday. We'll worth it for the price. Get it used if you can or you'll spend like 40 bux for the price of Tape you'll cut anyway\ud83e\udee3",

I couldn't decide if I wanted this size or bigger and I am SO glad I went with this size!! I changed the band on mine because I didn't find the one it came with to be very comfortable. Its durable and connects easily via bluetooth.

I obviously can't go too far away from my phone or my bluetooth will disconnect and I can't use the call/texts features BUT the reach is pretty far I have never had an issue. I can text and answer calls even with my phone being in the other room. I also LOVE this \"find my phone\" feature when I misplace my phone (which is often).

The screen is wonderful, with vivid colors and excellent brightness that allows it to be used without problems even in the sun. In addition, the functions are complete and practical, from health monitoring to notifications and integration with my phone.The only drawback is that I would have liked the battery to last a little longer.Still, I am very satisfied with the purchase.

        "review": "really wanted to keep this watch as the 40 mm size was perfect and loved the features.My use case was very simple, using it as a stand alone cycling fitness tracker that syncs to Strava fitness app.  I wanted it to record my miles ridden with gps and also leave my phone at home and still be able to make phone calls in case of emergency. Everything was working fine even though the miles tracked with gps were about a tenth of a mile off from my phone for every ten miles ridden. I could tell from the gps map of my ride using both the watch and the phone that my phone was able to track more accurately. There was less variability in the gps signal.Ok, so I could live with gps being off by a mile over a 100 mile bike ride.I was also comfortable with the battery life. Seemed like I could get a good 7hours or more using cellular, gps tracking, and data service. The rest of my day I didn't even wear the watch.The deal breaker for me was the lack of external heart rate monitor support.Shocker!  I have seen reviews saying how the heart rate tracking for the samsungs weren't that good and I had an external polar heart rate monitor I wanted to use. Well, I could not do that. I could not get my motorola phone to recognize the HR Monitor via bluetooth. I researched some and found some people had luck getting it to work with a little effort but only with a Samsung phone. Mine was a motorola.Sorry, but I need an external hr sensor so that was the deal breaker since I know the google pixel watch and the apple watches support that.If you're not picky like me and can live with the less accurate heart rate tracking built  into the watch then it's a great device and probably the best android based watch. I really didn't want to have to move to the apple eco system just for a watch.",

There seemed to be a big drop in battery when I was first adding apps.  However, the battery lasted the evening...with a few hours to spare.  I decided to keep this watch because I like the dressy appearance.  All apps seem to work great.",

        "review": "I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch 5 (40mm Bluetooth Smartwatch), and overall, I\u2019m quite impressed. Here are the things I love about it:Intuitive Setup: Getting started was straightforward, from installing apps to connecting and creating accounts. Everything synced seamlessly.Tracking: While my primary goal was to track physical activity, I was pleasantly surprised by its sleep monitoring feature. It not only tracks my sleep patterns but also offers tips to improve consistency, which is incredibly helpful.Personalization: It\u2019s easy to change watch faces or swap out bands, making it adaptable to any style or situation.Automatic Activity Recognition: The watch impressively tracks my activities automatically, even when I forget to set up a workout. Whether I\u2019m walking, rowing, following a workout video, or simply tidying up around the house, it picks up my movements accurately without manual input.Convenient Alarm Syncing: I also love how it syncs with my phone alarm. As autumn settles in here in Illinois, mornings can be dark, and alarms are easy to miss. The watch vibrates along with my phone alarm, making it harder to ignore and ensuring I get up on time.What Could Be Improved:Blood Pressure Tracking: While this isn\u2019t Samsung\u2019s fault, I wish the US allowed blood pressure monitoring on this device. I have another watch from Temu with this feature, and it\u2019s incredibly useful for seeing trends and understanding how different events impact my stress levels. It encourages me to manage stress more effectively rather than compartmentalize it.Battery Life: The battery longevity is a bit disappointing. I primarily use the watch for fitness, sleep tracking, and basic functions like stress measurement. Given my moderate usage, I expected the battery to last longer between charges, but I find myself needing to recharge it at least daily - as frequently as my phone.Final Thoughts: Despite these minor drawbacks, the Galaxy Watch 5 is well worth the investment. It\u2019s reliable, versatile, and convenient, and I believe it will last a long time. I would definitely buy it again.",

So now I am stuck with this piece of junk. That being said it is more than deserving of a one star review. If you like watches that one major feature upgrade than their counterparts but the feature absolutely does not work accurately or give you the option to check it 90% of the time I would like to introduce you to the skin temperature feature on this watch. Some how the most basic features for a smart watch is also incredibly unreliable and unavailable most of the time, this would be the heart rate monitor. Oh and I hope you like connectivity issues because that is all you are going to get with this. In the first 2 months of trying this product out it got disconnected from my phone 4 times and took days to reconnect. ( I have an android) sure this thing counts your steps but it counts a different amount then the feature my phone already includes so now I have to wonder which one is wrong. And beware the \"WiFi battery saving feature\" for some reason since the device would die much faster if it was constantly using WiFi it only uses WiFi when prompted to through specific settings/user interaction. But if course if we are having connectivity issues with everything else how surprising is it that this junky watch can't decide whether it should actually preform it's automatic setting tasks because it is capable of consistently reconnecting to the WiFi then updating these apps or tracking widgets... What ever, literally don't even try streaming anything Spotify and audiobooks that aren't downloaded are never going to consistently play for more than 2 mins. But don't worry you also won't have enough space to download music or books or too many apps, even though every app seems to need a second widget or app to operate on the watch...  Honestly not even sure how this watch is very usable it's like having a disappointment strapped to your wrist at all times. I just wish they would have honoured their window of return that was printed in bold every time I went to the return center but they are allowed to put a completely different one half way down the return instructions list. Not all of us have the time to thoroughly read the return instructions until we are ready to return... When I thought was during the return window... Very misleading",

        "review": "My wife and I have been fitbit fans since the Charge 2 (2016).\u00a0 Before the google purchase, fitbit was a strong leader in lower cost fitness trackers.\u00a0 It did concern us that our fitbits would die frequently (nearly each one we had died within a year from the Charge 2, 3, 4). However after talking with customer service they would send us replacement.\u00a0 So, ok, we can deal with that.\u00a0 (Even though in the past few years you had to provide a ton of documentation including, IIRC, your drivers license.)I had a fitbit 6 that I got for Christmas 2024.\u00a0 Wow, a color screen.\u00a0 LOL.\u00a0 I needed a replacement as the screen on my Charge 5 kept getting dimmer, and dimmer, to the point when I could not read it outdoors and barely indoors.\u00a0 So I was gifted the Charge 6 and it was big step up.\u00a0 But it took me a few months until I realized that the floors option was gone, not just not working, but removed, to make space for other features I could care less about.So I looked around in late June and discovered the Fit 3.\u00a0 So I bought one.\u00a0 I am SO GLAD I did.\u00a0 What do I need?\u00a0 Step counter, heart rate, floors, distance, calories.\u00a0 Oh, and the kicker for me was AIRPLANE MODE.\u00a0 I study various energetic sciences including BioGeometry and the EMF coming from our devices is not benign.\u00a0 I don't wear a tracker to sleep, don't want anything live, and keep my blue tooth turned off unless I am actively syncing.This is what I see comparing Fit 3 to Fitbit Charge 6.\u00a0 \u00a0What the Fit 3 has as an advantage:\u00a0 Larger screen, airplane mode, beautiful faces, much cleaner UI on the watch and in the android app(s) (I am using this with a Pixel 7 phone).\u00a0 The ability to sync only turning on bluetooth.\u00a0 A few years ago fitbit/google basically said we aren't syncing your fitbit unless you have both location/GPS and bluetooth turned on.\u00a0 Sometimes you could get the fitbit to sync with location off but this was tricky/spotty.What advantages did the Charge 6 have for me, personally.\u00a0 \u00a0None really.\u00a0 It cost about 3x the amount for the Charge 6 compared to the Fit 3.\u00a0 That's ridiculous.In a head to head comparsion of measurements this is what I see.\u00a0 \u00a0Fitbit Charge is often slower to start your step counts and the Fit 3 is quicker on that.\u00a0 So you steps counts are going to go up and perhaps the Fit 3 does count some arm motions as steps when it should not.\u00a0 But the Fit 3 is still very close (within 1-3%) with the Charge 6.\u00a0 The Fit 3 tends to undercount calories compared to the Charge 6, I can't tell which is more accurate.\u00a0 On the Charge 6 bluetooth syncing was always a laborious pain taking sometimes minutes to get the past few days of data and often having to turn bluetooth off/on and/or restarts to get it to sync.\u00a0 The Fit 3 is very fast *most* of the time.\u00a0 I did have one instance where the Fit 3 was not syncing in the Health App and I had to open the Wearable app and trigger a sync from there, which worked.The big thing is battery life.\u00a0 I have automatic activity tracking turned on and except when syncing in the evening I keep it on airplane mode.\u00a0 I charged it overnight last Thursday/Friday before I first put it on.\u00a0 It's now Wednesday evening, nearing 6 complete days of use and my battery level is at 55%.\u00a0 That frugal energy use is really good and is on par with the earlier monochrome fitbits.I am very pleased with my Fit 3 purchase.\u00a0 Back in the early to mid 2000's I was very excited about Timex was doing just in digital watches (Iron Man, etc).\u00a0 The Fit 3 harkens back to those kind of days for me when you could get a very full functionality wrist device that looked good, worked great, and was a good deal.\u00a0 This is definitely worth a close look if you don't need an higher priced fitness/communication device that is emitting EMFs into your pericardium meridian 24x7.\u00a0 Well done.",

Samsung did a great job, well constructed.  Battery life is long lasting.This watch helps motivate me to hit my step count, and I just barely starting using it for sleep tracking too.If you purchase it, may I suggest a cover for protection.Definitely 5 stars!",

        "review": "I bought this watch because I was looking for a smaller watch to wear to bed and around the house to keep an eye on my sleep and Heart Rate and so on. On that note it seems to do great at tracking my HR and sleep. I have tried quite a few other watches and just could not find one that worked for me but this one is small enough that it's comfortable to wear at all times and even great to wear when sleeping. I have not had any issues with it's phone connection it seems to stay connected the only time it looses connection is when I walk across to the other side of my house but as soon as I get back within range it instantly reconnects to my phone with no issues.It's nice because I can keep track of the battery level of my phone (Galaxy Flip 6) and watch using my watch.I do wish it had a speaker just for receiving notifications, phone calls and alarms but the vibration does a good enough job of letting me know.I can usually get about 5-6 days of battery life out of it and the battery charges quite quickly.One of the only complaints I have so far for this watch is the band has a connection system that requires you to buy an adaptor if you want to use another type of watch band. But they are usually quite cheap and easy to come by so it's not to big of an issue.",

This happened twice since I've owned the watch, and it's usually been on actually hot days.  I do have a protective cover, so that may be part o the problem.2) Run tracking is buggy...sometimes.  I often start my run from my front door, where my watch has a connection with either my WiFi or phone.  When I start a run from this location, it always seems to have trouble determining how far I've run.  I'll be 3 minutes into my run and it will say I've done a mile (I wish!).  If I bring my phone with me, there is no issue.  If I drive to a trail and run it does perfectly fine.  I have the feeling their run tracking is using a WiFi rough location to start my run.3) Spotify.  This won't count against the watch so much, because it's probably mostly a software issue.  I would think it's a pretty good chance that using Spotify with headphones while you're not around your phone is a pretty good use case for a cellular watch.  This does work, but it's really not intuitive to use.  Sometimes the Spotify UI will just sit there and not tell you whether it's trying to play something, or if it's loading, or whatever.  You can literally sit there for minutes fiddling around trying to figure out what Spotify is trying to do.  Sometimes when it does work, the events are delayed.  For instance I may have chosen a song 10 seconds ago, and gotten no feedback from the UI, yet it will eventually play something.4) Google's apps aren't fully integrated.  It's like they're still not fully committed to wearables.  For instance, if someone is at the door, you will get a notification.  Would you like to see who it is?  Well, you will have to go find your phone.  There are many apps that don't show useful notifications on the watch.  There is so much opportunity to make wearables actually much better than they are, and it's frustrating that Google just doesn't put in the effort.That's pretty much the bad stuff.  Now for the good news.  When this watch works, it does a really nice job.  The watch faces built in are really nice IMO, and you can customize them pretty well with useful shortcuts. (I added a shortcut to start a workout and another to set a timer).  We do get Google Assistant now, and I've assigned mine to be triggered by long pressing one of the buttons.  Google pay works fine for me.  In my experience the battery is much much better than my previous Android watches, which removes some level of anxiety.  The build quality is great.  I am rough with my watches, and the screen on this one is pretty much scratch free at this point.  I take this in the pool and in the shower, so absolutely no issues with water exposure.  The workout tracking software is actually great when it is recording correctly.",

With all features on, continuous monitoring, adaptive brightness, Wifi, Bluetooth, NFC, sleep, step & stress tracking on, along with frequently checking messages, weather radar, and my daily planner, I can get about 36 hours of battery life. With all those features off on power save mode, it can last roughly 60 hours. So depending on the desired use, you have a decent window to work with. I charge mine once per day, typically on my lunch break. Charge time takes about an hour to fully charge from 40%. Even faster if you shut the watch off. If you're not worried about a rotating bezel, the GW5 PRO is a fantastic smart watch. Even more so than the GW6 classic in my experience, which when fully utilized dies in about 20 hours. My GW6 classic is about 20 feet deep in my local lakeside community and honestly, I'm glad I got the GW5 pro. I couldn't deal with the constant need to charge. Also, the new One UI 6.0 and the wear OS 5.0 update that came thru a few weeks ago seemingly gave the watch a smoother look, feel and font, along with more accurate sleep and health monitoring abilities. 5\ud83c\udf1f All day.",

The strap is comfortable, but the fact that it doesn't open completely can make it difficult to use some types of chargers. It's a big watch, so be aware of that.

I never wanted a smart watch, but I did want a way to track heart rate, steps, and my workouts. For the price of the refreshed option and the comfort of knowing I could return it if it wasn't as expected, I figured, why not give it a try? I'm a Galaxy girl and have all Samsung devices so it fits right in.First, the watch shipped without original packaging - there were a couple comments that said they received all the original packaging so I was initially a little bummed about that. But not like I need more packaging to take up space. The charger included in the box is not OEM but it does work to charge the watch (it is the slower 1A 5V charger). The watch itself looks brand new. Can't tell that it had been used at all. I put it through its paces and it seems to hold a charge very well. I had actually also purchased the black version and the Watch 6 (both refreshed) to see which one I like best. The 6 came in OEM packaging and while I preferred the size of the watch 6, the battery life couldn't come close to the 5 Pro. I also preferred the brushed nickel look over the black version of the 5 Pro. I was worried because this model indicated it is the Latin America version, but it works just like the other 5 Pro.The watch is huge and I have very small wrists so it has been an adjustment wearing something so bulky. The OEM band was too big for me and even though I made it work, the excess strap caused an awkward fit. I replaced the band with a thinner silicone band and it is much more comfortable now.That said, the features that it offers are impressive. My favorites: body composition analysis, sleep tracking, integration with Samsung Health and my fitness apps such as GymRun & MyNetDiary. I also love being able to get messages and texts without having to pick up my phone. This watch is a key motivator in helping me achieve my fitness goals so for that aspect alone, worth the refreshed cost! I definitely won't hesitate to buy Amazon Refreshed for other items in the future, just know that there is a spectrum of what you'll get.",

If you spend this much money, at least get Facer or in my opinion you've wasted your money,  cause the faces is where it's at for me. I was certain I didn't need the lte but would have gotten it for sure if I knew than what I know now. I have no regrets just would have gotten it. I love the black, but sort of wish I would have gone with silver cause of the bands you can buy. It's a very good feeling watch nice and heavy.Change the band immediately unless you like to live in discomfort and protect the bezel not the screen. Trust me and if you insist on screen protector the inner are you will put it on is like bevel or cone shaped so if the glass isn't you'll regret it \ud83e\udd2d add tons of music and pictures easy to use and change. Turn your notifications sound to vibrate and minimal sounds or when it gets to updates you'll be a very noisy fellow. And turn your screen to AOD and only push button to wake. Battery is good but not for the first month when it's figuring out your usage patterns I wish you can adjust the speed with your bezel turn you have to turn it like one whole rotation to scroll like 3/4\" of page and also the direction. For some reason I'd rather turn it the other direction. Watch is a 5/5 still but dont expect it to be miraculous. It's just a watch with smart features and incredible if you  are into fitness which I'm not. Love how it works when I jump on my bike and when I'm off it's very accurate with steps and bike riding.Spend the money and buy something you will use everyday. We'll worth it for the price. Get it used if you can or you'll spend like 40 bux for the price of Tape you'll cut anyway\ud83e\udee3",

I obviously can't go too far away from my phone or my bluetooth will disconnect and I can't use the call/texts features BUT the reach is pretty far I have never had an issue. I can text and answer calls even with my phone being in the other room. I also LOVE this \"find my phone\" feature when I misplace my phone (which is often).

        "review": "really wanted to keep this watch as the 40 mm size was perfect and loved the features.My use case was very simple, using it as a stand alone cycling fitness tracker that syncs to Strava fitness app.  I wanted it to record my miles ridden with gps and also leave my phone at home and still be able to make phone calls in case of emergency. Everything was working fine even though the miles tracked with gps were about a tenth of a mile off from my phone for every ten miles ridden. I could tell from the gps map of my ride using both the watch and the phone that my phone was able to track more accurately. There was less variability in the gps signal.Ok, so I could live with gps being off by a mile over a 100 mile bike ride.I was also comfortable with the battery life. Seemed like I could get a good 7hours or more using cellular, gps tracking, and data service. The rest of my day I didn't even wear the watch.The deal breaker for me was the lack of external heart rate monitor support.Shocker!  I have seen reviews saying how the heart rate tracking for the samsungs weren't that good and I had an external polar heart rate monitor I wanted to use. Well, I could not do that. I could not get my motorola phone to recognize the HR Monitor via bluetooth. I researched some and found some people had luck getting it to work with a little effort but only with a Samsung phone. Mine was a motorola.Sorry, but I need an external hr sensor so that was the deal breaker since I know the google pixel watch and the apple watches support that.If you're not picky like me and can live with the less accurate heart rate tracking built  into the watch then it's a great device and probably the best android based watch. I really didn't want to have to move to the apple eco system just for a watch.",

I like the 6 cuz it has hand gestures to control certain features. super cool.My pic is when i first powered it on, and the screen has no scratches.",

The other nice thing was a lot of my stuff transferred from my old watch to the new, so I didn't have to add back my alarms and stuff. That was swell. I also like that the watch can do sound alarms, and they're not super annoying or obtrusive.All-in-all, good watch. Happy I took a chance on the refurbished.

      {
        "review": "I've had a 4 Classic since 2021 and there's enough to like about it that I haven't seen a watch I'd rather have. The battery life is the biggest downside. You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit. A black band would put more focus on the watch itself.",

The mobile watch data transfer is seamless and am loving the classic dial. The only problem is the battery life, which lasts only 12 hours. But that's understandable given the price.

        "review": "And to think you can buy a top of the line smartwatch from a few years ago that compares to the price of regular watches. I paid 400 when this watch released back In 2021, It got water damage. Then I decided to buy this refurbished watch, it was great but I lost it in a week, but Keep in mind it didnt come with the original cable, but that was okay to me because I still have the original cable from the other watch, and if youre wondering. Yes, it has the same charging speed. So after I lost the watch, I decided to buy it again. Make sure to turn on remote protecting & anti theft, and turn on Location sharing so other people can find your watch if you lose it. And try to keep it away from water if you want it to last you a long time, we dont really know how good that refubrished waterproof seal is, but even my brand new one is bought on release got water damage after a few months, so just keep it away from water if you want it to last a couple years.Final thoughts, just buy it, its 60 and the perfect balance between functionality and price, or you can wait 4 years until today's top of the line Samsung watches sell for under 100, Your choice!",

I came from an Amazfit that was starting to annoy my by refusing to do alerts.  This Samsung watch is a couple of generations old and is refurbished.  I cannot tell that is isn't brand new, and everything works well.  I have a Samsung phone, so using the Samsung Wear app and syncing to the watch was super easy.  Battery life is great - I'm at 75% after using it all day (no way am I going to be wanting to sleep with a watch on!).  The step count is accurate.  Setting what apps to alert was easy.  The display is nice and bright.  I haven't bothered with EKG or other body measurements - I care about step counts.  Along with that it purports to measure activity and calories expended - I have no way to know if they're accurate...  Anyway, bottom line - I'm very happy with this watch!",

However after talking with customer service they would send us replacement.\u00a0 So, ok, we can deal with that.\u00a0 (Even though in the past few years you had to provide a ton of documentation including, IIRC, your drivers license.)I had a fitbit 6 that I got for Christmas 2024.\u00a0 Wow, a color screen.\u00a0 LOL.\u00a0 I needed a replacement as the screen on my Charge 5 kept getting dimmer, and dimmer, to the point when I could not read it outdoors and barely indoors.\u00a0 So I was gifted the Charge 6 and it was big step up.\u00a0 But it took me a few months until I realized that the floors option was gone, not just not working, but removed, to make space for other features I could care less about.So I looked around in late June and discovered the Fit 3.\u00a0 So I bought one.\u00a0 I am SO GLAD I did.\u00a0 What do I need?\u00a0 Step counter, heart rate, floors, distance, calories.\u00a0 Oh, and the kicker for me was AIRPLANE MODE.\u00a0 I study various energetic sciences including BioGeometry and the EMF coming from our devices is not benign.\u00a0 I don't wear a tracker to sleep, don't want anything live, and keep my blue tooth turned off unless I am actively syncing.This is what I see comparing Fit 3 to Fitbit Charge 6.\u00a0 \u00a0What the Fit 3 has as an advantage:\u00a0 Larger screen, airplane mode, beautiful faces, much cleaner UI on the watch and in the android app(s) (I am using this with a Pixel 7 phone).\u00a0 The ability to sync only turning on bluetooth.\u00a0 A few years ago fitbit/google basically said we aren't syncing your fitbit unless you have both location/GPS and bluetooth turned on.\u00a0 Sometimes you could get the fitbit to sync with location off but this was tricky/spotty.What advantages did the Charge 6 have for me, personally.\u00a0 \u00a0None really.\u00a0 It cost about 3x the amount for the Charge 6 compared to the Fit 3.\u00a0 That's ridiculous.In a head to head comparsion of measurements this is what I see.\u00a0 \u00a0Fitbit Charge is often slower to start your step counts and the Fit 3 is quicker on that.\u00a0 So you steps counts are going to go up and perhaps the Fit 3 does count some arm motions as steps when it should not.\u00a0 But the Fit 3 is still very close (within 1-3%) with the Charge 6.\u00a0 The Fit 3 tends to undercount calories compared to the Charge 6, I can't tell which is more accurate.\u00a0 On the Charge 6 bluetooth syncing was always a laborious pain taking sometimes minutes to get the past few days of data and often having to turn bluetooth off/on and/or restarts to get it to sync.\u00a0 The Fit 3 is very fast *most* of the time.\u00a0 I did have one instance where the Fit 3 was not syncing in the Health App and I had to open the Wearable app and trigger a sync from there, which worked.The big thing is battery life.\u00a0 I have automatic activity tracking turned on and except when syncing in the evening I keep it on airplane mode.\u00a0 I charged it overnight last Thursday/Friday before I first put it on.\u00a0 It's now Wednesday evening, nearing 6 complete days of use and my battery level is at 55%.\u00a0 That frugal energy use is really good and is on par with the earlier monochrome fitbits.I am very pleased with my Fit 3 purchase.\u00a0 Back in the early to mid 2000's I was very excited about Timex was doing just in digital watches (Iron Man, etc).\u00a0 The Fit 3 harkens back to those kind of days for me when you could get a very full functionality wrist device that looked good, worked great, and was a good deal.\u00a0 This is definitely worth a close look if you don't need an higher priced fitness/communication device that is emitting EMFs into your pericardium meridian 24x7.\u00a0 Well done.",

I have tried quite a few other watches and just could not find one that worked for me but this one is small enough that it's comfortable to wear at all times and even great to wear when sleeping. I have not had any issues with it's phone connection it seems to stay connected the only time it looses connection is when I walk across to the other side of my house but as soon as I get back within range it instantly reconnects to my phone with no issues.It's nice because I can keep track of the battery level of my phone (Galaxy Flip 6) and watch using my watch.I do wish it had a speaker just for receiving notifications, phone calls and alarms but the vibration does a good enough job of letting me know.I can usually get about 5-6 days of battery life out of it and the battery charges quite quickly.One of the only complaints I have so far for this watch is the band has a connection system that requires you to buy an adaptor if you want to use another type of watch band. But they are usually quite cheap and easy to come by so it's not to big of an issue.",

      {
        "review": "Had this watch for about a week now. I was initially hesitant about the purchase, as this is my first smart watch. After research, and getting acquainted with the tool, I'm so happy I pulled the trigger. I use it every day for surprisingly detailed sleep tracking, enhanced step/activity tracking, ease of checking notifications and responding when I don't have easy access to my phone (or if I'm not supposed to at work), and on top of all of that, it's just a fantastic looking watch. The amount of functions you have access to is fantastic. I have paid more in my life for a watch that literally could only tell time. Lol. I know the health monitoring data may not be spot on, but it has really helped me focus on the right things during day to day. If you're on the fence, do it. If you have a Samsung phone, definitely do it.Some tips:1.) I recommend the first thing you do is order the official Samsung wireless charger to go with it. The charger shipped with this watch is off-brand and charges at about 5 watts, which takes about 2.5-3 hours. The Samsung charger provides 10 watt fast charging which takes 90 minutes at most. Again, the included charger is aftermarket, and slooowww. Get the Samsung one. The battery life on this watch is good, but not phenomenal, so having a faster charger is key to low stress ownership. These smart devices take at least one or two charge cycles to optimize battery use, so be patient with the first couple of battery cycles. I got one day out of the first two, then started getting a full 2 days easy, with slight tweaks to functions, but still fairly liberal use. I've attached screen shots of my batter usage stats after the break in period. If you want to have everything running all day at full capacity, again definitely get the Samsung charger so you can juice up faster after a day of heavy use.2.) This is not a brand new watch. It was manufactured in 2022, and used by a previous owner for years. Do not expect it to be in perfect cosmetic condition. For the price, I think this is reasonable (approx $100 vs $400 new when it came out). Mine has a couple of blemishes, but the screen is in excellent condition. Still looks great to my eye! Consider getting a case and screen protector.3.) I also recommend taking some rubbing alcohol, a micro fiber cloth, and some q-tips to the watch on arrival. The refurbishing on it is okay, but I did still clean off a thin layer of built up grime from the previous owner, especially in some hard to reach spots.4.) If you are fairly active I recommend getting a different band for the watch. The OEM rubber one ends up slipping all over anytime I build up a sweat. If I try to tighten it enough to stay still, it ends up pinching and cutting off blood flow. I work in food service, so having to constantly readjust the position through my shift has been annoying. I also have slim wrists, and forums seem to say the \"no gap\" bands are to be avoided. You want that gap so the band can bend down from the mounting point to provide more wrist contact.In summary: This watch has been a super enjoyable addition to my health tracking, Samsung ecosystem, and just general gadgets I use on the daily. I love it! Still giving it 5 stars despite the effort I've had to put in to make everything work right for me, because the price is an absolute steal. I don't have money for a brand new smart watch, but this one still holds its own with the current market, from what I've gathered, and even provides better battery life than a lot of brand new watches.",

        "review": "Like many others, I got the watch refurbished to save half off the sticker, which is still pricey for a last gen model. I figured since Amazon was fulfilling the order, it would be easier and safer to replace a defective one if I got unlucky (as I have been burned before and am very wary of renewed products).It's been about a week and to be honest I was expecting glitches, but none have yet to be found! The refurbishing partner clearly knows what they're doing in fixing up their tech. The original seller listed for my purchase was Chubbiestech.The only thing to be aware of is that there is clear evidence that this is an opened and refurbished product - adhesive remnants around the face edge and some scuff marks around the ring were the first things I noticed upon opening the package. That being said, these were very minor blemishes that I ended up covering anyway with a watch case. The screen itself is completely clear of any scratches or marks, and so far responds to touch very well.The operating system seems to respond at a fair speed. Not having owned a brand new version of this same watch, I can't say much more than this. By general \"feeling\" of OS responsiveness, this watch could maybe be smoother as it sometimes hesitates or stutters between changing screens. However, it could very well be the limitation of Samsung's OS itself and not anything to do with the refurbishment.Battery life has also been fair - the watch would last me about 72 hours as a moderate user (daily exercise, step count, HR monitor every 10 minutes, overnight for sleep tracking). Heavier use (music, phone calls) brings down the battery a lot faster as to be expected, but I see it lasting at minimum 24 hours without charge. Charging takes about 20 minutes to juice up ~30%, so I can expect a full charge in 1 hour as long as the watch isn't dead. I did not receive a Samsung charger, but the unbranded one works just as well.Overall, super happy about this purchase, and even happier for getting it basically half off the market price for a brand new one!",

        "review": "Had this watch for about a week now. I was initially hesitant about the purchase, as this is my first smart watch. After research, and getting acquainted with the tool, I'm so happy I pulled the trigger. I use it every day for surprisingly detailed sleep tracking, enhanced step/activity tracking, ease of checking notifications and responding when I don't have easy access to my phone (or if I'm not supposed to at work), and on top of all of that, it's just a fantastic looking watch. The amount of functions you have access to is fantastic. I have paid more in my life for a watch that literally could only tell time. Lol. I know the health monitoring data may not be spot on, but it has really helped me focus on the right things during day to day. If you're on the fence, do it. If you have a Samsung phone, definitely do it.Some tips:1.) I recommend the first thing you do is order the official Samsung wireless charger to go with it. The charger shipped with this watch is off-brand and charges at about 5 watts, which takes about 2.5-3 hours. The Samsung charger provides 10 watt fast charging which takes 90 minutes at most. Again, the included charger is aftermarket, and slooowww. Get the Samsung one. The battery life on this watch is good, but not phenomenal, so having a faster charger is key to low stress ownership. These smart devices take at least one or two charge cycles to optimize battery use, so be patient with the first couple of battery cycles. I got one day out of the first two, then started getting a full 2 days easy, with slight tweaks to functions, but still fairly liberal use. I've attached screen shots of my batter usage stats after the break in period. If you want to have everything running all day at full capacity, again definitely get the Samsung charger so you can juice up faster after a day of heavy use.2.) This is not a brand new watch. It was manufactured in 2022, and used by a previous owner for years. Do not expect it to be in perfect cosmetic condition. For the price, I think this is reasonable (approx $100 vs $400 new when it came out). Mine has a couple of blemishes, but the screen is in excellent condition. Still looks great to my eye! Consider getting a case and screen protector.3.) I also recommend taking some rubbing alcohol, a micro fiber cloth, and some q-tips to the watch on arrival. The refurbishing on it is okay, but I did still clean off a thin layer of built up grime from the previous owner, especially in some hard to reach spots.4.) If you are fairly active I recommend getting a different band for the watch. The OEM rubber one ends up slipping all over anytime I build up a sweat. If I try to tighten it enough to stay still, it ends up pinching and cutting off blood flow. I work in food service, so having to constantly readjust the position through my shift has been annoying. I also have slim wrists, and forums seem to say the \"no gap\" bands are to be avoided. You want that gap so the band can bend down from the mounting point to provide more wrist contact.In summary: This watch has been a super enjoyable addition to my health tracking, Samsung ecosystem, and just general gadgets I use on the daily. I love it! Still giving it 5 stars despite the effort I've had to put in to make everything work right for me, because the price is an absolute steal. I don't have money for a brand new smart watch, but this one still holds its own with the current market, from what I've gathered, and even provides better battery life than a lot of brand new watches.",

Watch showed up yesterday and looks brand new, had a few smudges on it but they wiped off. Was surprised to see I got the golf version with a black band, but I don't mind as the green button adds a little color to an all black watch. Watch is fast and snappy, taking a little getting used to not having a bezel like on my Gear S3 Classic but overall I'm really impressed.",

        "review": "For a couple years I've been searching for a watch that had multiple alarms that can be set to vibrate. Seems pretty simple I thought. Not so! Being a fan of Casio watches I hoped they would have one. They have watches that vibrate, but none with multiple alarms. I tried a few off-brand smart watches, they were a pain to use. I really didn't want to spend 300 bucks on a watch to have this seeming simple feature. On a whim, I decided to try a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. 99 bucks, and if it doesn't do the trick, I'll return it and continue searching. This watch does it! Yay! The fact that I can set it up from my phone is an added bonus; being 65, my eyes ain't what they used to be. So I got various alarms set up (coffee brew, wings on the grill, etc.) and was pretty happy. I don't really care about all the health stuff. What really pleased me was when I was listening to music from my Plex server on a Plex HTPC. I was controlling the music from my computer, but also had Plexamp open on my phone. All of a sudden I look at my watch, and there is a Plexamp interface! Whoa! I can control the tunes from my phone too! How awesome is that?! This watch will NOT be going back, it checks all the boxes and then some!",

I got it mainly for the step tracking feature to encourage myself to walk more. I'm really enjoying it and it seems to work quite well (so far the most I have done is 17,000). But my goal is 10,000/day, which I meet probably half of the time. My second most favorite feature is the \"Find my phone\" feature, just tap it and the phone beeps loudly. (Awesome!!) I've missed wearing\u00a0 a watch, so I\u00a0 really like that, and finally seeing texts pop up is nice too, so that I don't have to have my phone right with me always. I tried it at night to track my sleep for a couple of nights, but I decided that probably wasn't healthy to wear it constantly. It seemed accurate though. I like the way it looks and also I like thar it is water resistant. I purchased protective face covers that work great also. It paired easily to my Samsung Galaxy A13\u00a0 phone. Although you charge it by attaching it to your phone, it charges really quickly, in under half an hour.\u00a0 I've owned it for a couple of weeks and have been wearing it almost every day.",

So far it is durable and was easy to connect to apps. The pink color is not obnoxious, very muted so it goes with everything nicely.

        "review": "My Galaxy (4) watch was ready for an upgrade!I always do my research and read the reviews before I buy a product. This purchase was no different. I was somewhat concerned with a number of reviewers complaining that the battery was not good and didn't last long. So, I want to address that concern first.With all of my watches I never use the Always on Display function. I realize that the watch faces are beautiful on the Galaxy Screen. However, those beautiful bright LED's use power. If you leave them on all the time you can expect maximum battery drain. I have everything turned on except the AOD. Yesterday I used my watch a lot as I was playing and experimenting with all the cool features. Wore it through the night to monitor my sleep. This morning at 6 a.m. I had used a total of 27 percent of battery power for a 24 hour period! At this rate of power usage I can expect 3+ days of use. Battery life doesn't concern me at all.SETUP (Stars*****)I was expecting to make a trip to my service provider because I use the LTE version. I figured I could do all the setup minus the phone provider portion at home. I was extremely impressed with the setup/switch procedure. Simple, straight forward and quick!I was pleased at how simple and easy the setup was. As soon as I was done I needed to let my dogs out for a walk. While I was out walking the girls my Watch rang! I answered it and had a nice conversation. The switch feature swapped over and set up all of my LTE functions without the need to spend half a day at my phone providers location!DIGITAL RING VERSUS PHYSICAL (Stars *****)I never really liked the physical ring all that much. The new digital ring is awesome! Good job Samsung!CHARGING (Stars *****)Charges extremely fast with the little charger that comes with the watch. This small charger is great for travel. I ordered a couple more.FITNESS (Stars *****)I'm still using them and can only say that so far they are still the award winning excersize App/sensors they have always been.AI (Stars *****)Wow! This opens up a whole new experience with my watch. I use Alexa to do so many things now. The ability to put Alexa on my watch is a real game changer. Don't worry, if you prefer Google assistant you can use that as well.ASTHETICS (Stars *****)I think Samsung could have done a better job with the advertisement pics out there. I was initially disappointed at how the Galaxy 7 looked. When I actually got the watch I happily realized the pics don't do it justice. I think that this is the most aesthetically pleasing watch Samsung has made to date.THE BAND (Stars ***)Nope. I knew I didn't like the watch band it comes with from the pics. If you want an extra you can have mine. I ordered a watch band from Wingle to match the silver of the watch. Wow! They are a perfect match and look gorgeous!I couldn't be happier! What a great Smartwatch. When you pair this watch with the Samsung family of devices it is in a class of it's own!OVERALL: Five Stars!RECOMMEND?: Absolutely YES!",

I can easily go through a full day of workouts, notifications, and sleep tracking without worrying about running out of juice.Health & Fitness Tracking: Comprehensive and AccurateSamsung\u2019s health and fitness tracking capabilities on the Galaxy Watch 7 are excellent.

I have not had to shut it down because of any freezing, or glitches. It has tracked my workouts great, and the battery is really good. However, I don't believe the battery life is better than my apple watch, but close. I am an active person, so my watch gets used much. I recommend the galaxy watch ultra to anyone who is on the fence about getting one. If you don't mind big watches, and you track your runs, calories, and any workouts, I don't see you going wrong by picking one up.

It\u2019s bright, sharp, and responsive, making it easy to read notifications, track fitness stats, and navigate apps even in direct sunlight. The customizable watch faces are a fantastic touch, allowing me to switch from a sporty look during workouts to something more professional for the office. The LTE connectivity is a standout feature for me\u2014I can leave my phone behind and still make calls, send texts, stream music, and even use GPS navigation seamlessly. It\u2019s perfect for runs, hikes, or even just quick errands without being tied to my phone.When it comes to health and fitness tracking, the AI-powered sensors are incredibly accurate and insightful. The heart rate monitoring, SpO2 sensor, advanced sleep analysis, and ECG capabilities make it feel like having a personal health assistant on my wrist. I love the detailed workout modes that adapt based on my activities, providing real-time feedback and post-workout analysis that helps me track progress effectively. The GPS is also impressively accurate, which is a must for my outdoor runs and cycling sessions.Battery life was a pleasant surprise, considering all the features packed into this watch. I can easily get two full days of use with LTE, GPS, and continuous health monitoring enabled. When I do need to recharge, the fast-charging feature gets me back to full power quickly, which is a huge plus for someone constantly on the move.Another aspect I appreciate is the integration with Samsung\u2019s ecosystem. Syncing with my Galaxy phone was seamless, and I love the ability to control smart home devices directly from my wrist. The voice assistant is responsive and accurate, making tasks like setting reminders, controlling music, or checking the weather effortless.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47mm LTE AI Smartwatch is everything I could ask for and more. It combines a sleek design, powerful performance, and comprehensive health tracking into one impressive package.

There are so many free watch faces and colors to choose from and download and install from the app on your smart phone.There are so many functions to this watch it's mind numbing. Easy to setup using the Samsung app. The watch itself is very sturdy and has survived some hard bumps without a scratch.My only wish is for longer battery life. With everything running, the battery lasts about three days for me.",

        "review": "This is a Bluetooth only Galaxy Watch 6 Classic in 47mm size.  It is the classic version so it has a rotating bezel.  The one I ordered is a stainless steel silver color and has a gray silicone band.  It is the third galaxy watch I have had, but the first I have purchased \"renewed.\"  Out of the box it took about 8 minutes to set up.  The initial setup started as soon as I turned on the watch and my phone found it (I didn't even have to open the Galaxy Wear app, but that is probably because I already had a Galaxy Watch 4 connected.)  The only hitches in the setup were with the Google tie in to the watch, I had to do two steps twice to get them to complete.  The downside on the watch as received is that is had roughly a 5% charge, so getting started with updates, connection, setup, etc. without putting it on a charger would have been an issue.  I put it on a charger and continued the process once I realized the battery was so low.  I would recommend charging the watch first before starting the process to be safe.  The watch came in a zip lock plastic bag and the only other thing in the box was a magnetic charger base that plugs into a USB A port.  There were no instructions or any other items, so for a user who is new to a Galaxy watch this could be a bit of a problem.  The watch looks very good, the case looks like new, the strap looks like new, the display also looks like new, only the black outer part of the back looks like it has seen some wear.  I plan to give it a thorough cleaning with the disposable alcohol cleaning towelettes that I use to clean glasses once it is fully charged.  Because I had already used a Galaxy watch, the setup transferred all my settings, apps, and the watch face to this watch, which probably shortens the setup time.  A 47mm watch size is pretty large, so it might not be preferable for smaller wrists, but I am hopeful that the battery may last a little longer than the 43/44mm models.  The watch uses the same quick release 20mm bands that most other Galaxy watches use, which I consider to be a huge advantage over custom bands.  The renewed sixth generation watch cost about 43% of what a new similar seventh generation watch costs, so I thought is was worth taking the chance on a renewed watch.  The watch is a little heavier than the forth gen basic version I have, but I think the larger case and rotating bezel are worth the extra weight.",

I always loved using it.Last week I noticed it was finally quiting on me. The sensor part in the back broke apart so I decided to pick up another watch when I saw this one for around the same cost... Renewed.I didn't know what to expect. I was not expecting much actually. But when I opened the box and turned it on... Wow. I was totally impressed.It's bigger than I thought it would be. Not a deal breaker. But omg it is sooooo nice. The quality is amazing. The screen is awesome. It's easy to use. Easy to set up with lots of options.Apple watch who?! This watch beats that with the battery life. Absolutely loves this watch!!!",

        "review": "Okay, so I finally caved and got the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, and honestly? I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner! I was a bit hesitant about the price tag, but after a week of wearing this thing, I can confidently say it's worth every penny.First off, it just looks fantastic. The rotating bezel is back, and it feels so satisfying to click through menus. It gives it a real classic watch vibe, which I love. The screen is super crisp and bright, even when I'm out in the sun trying to read my notifications.Setting it up was a breeze \u2013 it paired with my Samsung phone instantly. I was a little worried about the battery life after reading some reviews, but it's been surprisingly good for me. I can easily get through a full day and night, even with using the sleep tracking and some light exercise tracking. I usually just pop it on the charger while I'm getting ready in the morning, and it's good to go again.Speaking of tracking, this watch is a beast! It tracks everything \u2013 my steps, my workouts (and it automatically detects some!), my sleep quality (which is actually pretty insightful), and even my heart rate and blood oxygen. It's given me a much better picture of my overall health and has motivated me to move more.The notifications are super handy too. I can see texts, emails, and app alerts right on my wrist, so I don't have to constantly pull out my phone. I can even reply to quick messages directly from the watch, which is a lifesaver when my hands are full.Honestly, I can't think of any major downsides. Maybe the price is a bit steep for some, but for the features and the premium feel, I think it's justified. If you're looking for a smartwatch that looks great, is packed with features, and actually makes your life a little easier, the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is a winner in my book. I'm absolutely loving it!",

        "review": "The watch is great! I only took a star away because I think the charger and band are crap. The band wasn't in good condition and actually broke apart a few times which made my new watch fall to the ground. Thankfully I had purchased a new protective cover for it and the watch wasn't damaged. I had also purchased new bands ( I didn't have them yet when it fell) and a charging station for both my phone and watch. Now that I have all the pieces together, I love it! The watch itself though is in great condition and so far working perfectly! Battery life is way different than the galaxy 4 I had before. So just know ahead of time you're paying for a renewed watch and it will most likely need newer things with it to make it perfect, but still WAY cheaper than all NEW.",

        "review": "I've had a 4 Classic since 2021 and there's enough to like about it that I haven't seen a watch I'd rather have. The battery life is the biggest downside. You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit. A black band would put more focus on the watch itself.",

My previous smart watch was a Samsung, so I knew basic stuff about how to/what to. The watch did come with a quick start guide and a charger, both very nice to have. It has all the same bells and whistles I was used to, plus more. I actually used the flashlight feature last night while my tiny was sleeping so I could move around without turning a light on, and that worked great. The battery isn't too bad for my purposes. I got 2 days out of it, but I tracked steps and sleep only. I did blood oxygen, and that depleted my battery pretty quick, but I just wanted to see what it was like. Neat feature, but not one I need. Anyway, it's on par with what my non-refurbished old watch used to get, so I'm very happy about that.The battery was dead when it arrived, but I got it charging and used my phone to do most of my set-up while it juiced. The other nice thing was a lot of my stuff transferred from my old watch to the new, so I didn't have to add back my alarms and stuff. That was swell. I also like that the watch can do sound alarms, and they're not super annoying or obtrusive.All-in-all, good watch. Happy I took a chance on the refurbished. And the size is just perfect for me, too.I did manage to scratch it already (I just got it this past weekish), but I have a toddler and I'm a klutz, so that's probably my doing anyway.I would like to suggest NEVER taking it swimming, or even in the shower, even though there's tracking for swimming and a \"water lock\". That's how I killed my old watch. It had/was the same that way, and now I'm just super distrustful of any watch that claims you can go swimming with it.",

It hooked up seamlessly (with the help of my 14yo daughter \ud83e\udd23) to my Motorola G 5G with no problems at all.  All of the Samsung health functions seem to work pretty flawlessly, the only thing I can't use is the ECG but I knew that going in since I have a non Samsung phone. The wrist band that came with it is comfortable enough to wear to bed! I read a ton of reviews about battery life and I must admit the 1st day I wore it I thought the reviews were correct, but I love gadgets and I probably fiddled with it more than most and I had the brightness all of the way up and by 10am it was at 17%. I adjusted the notifications, and a few settings including when the screen turns on and brightness. I easily get at least 2 days on 1 charge. All in all for the price I am so impressed and I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again. If anything changes I will edit this review. Hope this is helpful for everyone looking to get a smart watch.",

I have tried looking it up, but I'm not the greatest with this stuff, wish it was easier to check.4.the bluetooth can be a bit weird sometimes. It will connect to my earbuds randomly.Hope this helps someone",

It's so fast, helps me stay off my phone and is super fashionable! I love the way it looks, the fitness features, media controls, etc. The battery lasts ~ two days with always-on display turned on but all the data connections other than bluetooth turned off.It also looked absolutely brand new, even as an Amazon renewed product. Very impressed, one of the best purchases I've ever made.",

        "review": "So first things first I am a smartwatch virgin until now! My product arrived exactly as described, well packaged, and ready to go. It hooked up seamlessly (with the help of my 14yo daughter \ud83e\udd23) to my Motorola G 5G with no problems at all.  All of the Samsung health functions seem to work pretty flawlessly, the only thing I can't use is the ECG but I knew that going in since I have a non Samsung phone. The wrist band that came with it is comfortable enough to wear to bed! I read a ton of reviews about battery life and I must admit the 1st day I wore it I thought the reviews were correct, but I love gadgets and I probably fiddled with it more than most and I had the brightness all of the way up and by 10am it was at 17%. I adjusted the notifications, and a few settings including when the screen turns on and brightness. I easily get at least 2 days on 1 charge. All in all for the price I am so impressed and I would definitely recommend and buy from this seller again. If anything changes I will edit this review. Hope this is helpful for everyone looking to get a smart watch.",

        "review": "Had this watch for about a week now. I was initially hesitant about the purchase, as this is my first smart watch. After research, and getting acquainted with the tool, I'm so happy I pulled the trigger. I use it every day for surprisingly detailed sleep tracking, enhanced step/activity tracking, ease of checking notifications and responding when I don't have easy access to my phone (or if I'm not supposed to at work), and on top of all of that, it's just a fantastic looking watch. The amount of functions you have access to is fantastic. I have paid more in my life for a watch that literally could only tell time. Lol. I know the health monitoring data may not be spot on, but it has really helped me focus on the right things during day to day. If you're on the fence, do it. If you have a Samsung phone, definitely do it.Some tips:1.) I recommend the first thing you do is order the official Samsung wireless charger to go with it. The charger shipped with this watch is off-brand and charges at about 5 watts, which takes about 2.5-3 hours. The Samsung charger provides 10 watt fast charging which takes 90 minutes at most. Again, the included charger is aftermarket, and slooowww. Get the Samsung one. The battery life on this watch is good, but not phenomenal, so having a faster charger is key to low stress ownership. These smart devices take at least one or two charge cycles to optimize battery use, so be patient with the first couple of battery cycles. I got one day out of the first two, then started getting a full 2 days easy, with slight tweaks to functions, but still fairly liberal use. I've attached screen shots of my batter usage stats after the break in period. If you want to have everything running all day at full capacity, again definitely get the Samsung charger so you can juice up faster after a day of heavy use.2.) This is not a brand new watch. It was manufactured in 2022, and used by a previous owner for years. Do not expect it to be in perfect cosmetic condition. For the price, I think this is reasonable (approx $100 vs $400 new when it came out). Mine has a couple of blemishes, but the screen is in excellent condition. Still looks great to my eye! Consider getting a case and screen protector.3.) I also recommend taking some rubbing alcohol, a micro fiber cloth, and some q-tips to the watch on arrival. The refurbishing on it is okay, but I did still clean off a thin layer of built up grime from the previous owner, especially in some hard to reach spots.4.) If you are fairly active I recommend getting a different band for the watch. The OEM rubber one ends up slipping all over anytime I build up a sweat. If I try to tighten it enough to stay still, it ends up pinching and cutting off blood flow. I work in food service, so having to constantly readjust the position through my shift has been annoying. I also have slim wrists, and forums seem to say the \"no gap\" bands are to be avoided. You want that gap so the band can bend down from the mounting point to provide more wrist contact.In summary: This watch has been a super enjoyable addition to my health tracking, Samsung ecosystem, and just general gadgets I use on the daily. I love it! Still giving it 5 stars despite the effort I've had to put in to make everything work right for me, because the price is an absolute steal. I don't have money for a brand new smart watch, but this one still holds its own with the current market, from what I've gathered, and even provides better battery life than a lot of brand new watches.",

        "review": "Like many others, I got the watch refurbished to save half off the sticker, which is still pricey for a last gen model. I figured since Amazon was fulfilling the order, it would be easier and safer to replace a defective one if I got unlucky (as I have been burned before and am very wary of renewed products).It's been about a week and to be honest I was expecting glitches, but none have yet to be found! The refurbishing partner clearly knows what they're doing in fixing up their tech. The original seller listed for my purchase was Chubbiestech.The only thing to be aware of is that there is clear evidence that this is an opened and refurbished product - adhesive remnants around the face edge and some scuff marks around the ring were the first things I noticed upon opening the package. That being said, these were very minor blemishes that I ended up covering anyway with a watch case. The screen itself is completely clear of any scratches or marks, and so far responds to touch very well.The operating system seems to respond at a fair speed. Not having owned a brand new version of this same watch, I can't say much more than this. By general \"feeling\" of OS responsiveness, this watch could maybe be smoother as it sometimes hesitates or stutters between changing screens. However, it could very well be the limitation of Samsung's OS itself and not anything to do with the refurbishment.Battery life has also been fair - the watch would last me about 72 hours as a moderate user (daily exercise, step count, HR monitor every 10 minutes, overnight for sleep tracking). Heavier use (music, phone calls) brings down the battery a lot faster as to be expected, but I see it lasting at minimum 24 hours without charge. Charging takes about 20 minutes to juice up ~30%, so I can expect a full charge in 1 hour as long as the watch isn't dead. I did not receive a Samsung charger, but the unbranded one works just as well.Overall, super happy about this purchase, and even happier for getting it basically half off the market price for a brand new one!",

        "review": "I searched Amazon for hours for a watch. I didn't like the 22$ Casio I ordered, so I chose this one. I was so excited to finally own a Samsung smart watch, and boy was I let down.I read all the negative reviews about this watch, but was hypnotized by the features it says it has, and happily spent 270 bucks on the watch and the 3 year protection plan, only to be upset that the watch is a complete paper weight. The reviews are true, the battery life sucks, none of the apps are worth anything at all.I never use Samsung Health on my phone and it's equally as terrible of an experience on the watch, just completely inaccurate readings and pointless options, totally not helpful at all. The watch will download apps just to tell you that you need to also download the app to your phone, and then sign up for an account using the phone, not the watch, and you have to do this to even use whatever app it is that you want on your watch. In other words, the watch is not an independent device, it depends on your Samsung phone for everything, and that's a really poor user experience. I am returning this watch with the intentions of never buying a Samsung smart watch ever again. The 6 is even more horrible than this. I'm not impressed with these \"smart\" watches at all.In short: The volume for this watch is so quiet, health readings are a joke and report the wrong information, the apps are severely limited in functionality and design, typing on this thing is so cringe, you can't insert a period on the keyboard without switching the entire keyboard to special characters, so there goes all your easy .com entries, the Samsung Internet Browser is a POS and never scrolls the page correctly, trying to scroll around on the screen to show the edges of the pages is awful, the screen is incredibly small, navigation on this watch is atrocious, and the watch is incredibly laggy and unresponsive at times, more often than not.Beware: There's at least 1 hour of updates waiting for you. The watch arrives with no battery charge, so don't expect to be able to use it right out of the box, because you're going to be waiting for about 4 hours before you can fully use it when you have to deal with so many updates and charging the watch even you first get it. After wasting 2 days just to see if I even like the watch, I'm baffled at how much I actually dislike it. I love Samsung products, but I can't believe how trash this watch actually is, especially with this sky high price tag. After everything I've just seen, including wicked fast battery drain when you have to use the screen a lot, I personally value this watch at about 30 bucks, and not a single cent more, and that's being generous. The lack of features, user experience, and independence from the phone itself devalued this thing by a lot. It's outdated and obsolete gadgetry. I am not even exaggerating with the battery life being this bad, I read the other reviews and thought they just got a bad product, but it's true, this watch can't seem to keep up with everything it's doing.As I was wearing the watch, my seen kept kinda hurting and when I would feel that, I would look at the bottom of the watch, and it was lasering me with a green light. I could feel the light effecting my whole arm in a negative way. And, the watch does come with a cancer warning, and if you read all the info in the product listing, you'll see. So, I guess avoid this watch if you don't want it poisoning your body and causing you harm. Don't say that I didn't warn you.And again, I am here to remind you that this watch CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT A SAMSUNG PHONE, THIS IS NOT AN INDEPENDENT DEVICE, and that fact alone makes this watch a terrible investment. I bought it for the golf capabilities, but I returned it after seeing how useless this watch really is, trust me, most of the POSITIVE REVIEWS are NOT REAL and are just so you but their product.200 bucks for a smart watch that's this dated in technology and design is an incredibly shoddy investment. I thought that was bad enough alone.... But, as soon as I received the watch, I see that they're offering this watch for 30 bucks less than what I bought it for, that's really terrible business practice.Overall, the experience of this watch is awful, and I would rather have my money back than have to be this pissed off that I wasted hundreds of dollars on a watch that's this trash. Not a wise investment. Causes cancer and harms your body. Do not recommend, 0 stars if I could. Avoid at all costs, save yourself the disappointment, save your health, protect your private health data from being spied on, and save your money, it's not worth it at all, you absolutely have to trust me, DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH! IT CAUSES CANCER!",

        "review": "I searched Amazon for hours for a watch. I didn't like the 22$ Casio I ordered, so I chose this one. I was so excited to finally own a Samsung smart watch, and boy was I let down.I read all the negative reviews about this watch, but was hypnotized by the features it says it has, and happily spent 270 bucks on the watch and the 3 year protection plan, only to be upset that the watch is a complete paper weight. The reviews are true, the battery life sucks, none of the apps are worth anything at all.I never use Samsung Health on my phone and it's equally as terrible of an experience on the watch, just completely inaccurate readings and pointless options, totally not helpful at all. The watch will download apps just to tell you that you need to also download the app to your phone, and then sign up for an account using the phone, not the watch, and you have to do this to even use whatever app it is that you want on your watch. In other words, the watch is not an independent device, it depends on your Samsung phone for everything, and that's a really poor user experience. I am returning this watch with the intentions of never buying a Samsung smart watch ever again. The 6 is even more horrible than this. I'm not impressed with these \"smart\" watches at all.In short: The volume for this watch is so quiet, health readings are a joke and report the wrong information, the apps are severely limited in functionality and design, typing on this thing is so cringe, you can't insert a period on the keyboard without switching the entire keyboard to special characters, so there goes all your easy .com entries, the Samsung Internet Browser is a POS and never scrolls the page correctly, trying to scroll around on the screen to show the edges of the pages is awful, the screen is incredibly small, navigation on this watch is atrocious, and the watch is incredibly laggy and unresponsive at times, more often than not.Beware: There's at least 1 hour of updates waiting for you. The watch arrives with no battery charge, so don't expect to be able to use it right out of the box, because you're going to be waiting for about 4 hours before you can fully use it when you have to deal with so many updates and charging the watch even you first get it. After wasting 2 days just to see if I even like the watch, I'm baffled at how much I actually dislike it. I love Samsung products, but I can't believe how trash this watch actually is, especially with this sky high price tag. After everything I've just seen, including wicked fast battery drain when you have to use the screen a lot, I personally value this watch at about 30 bucks, and not a single cent more, and that's being generous. The lack of features, user experience, and independence from the phone itself devalued this thing by a lot. It's outdated and obsolete gadgetry. I am not even exaggerating with the battery life being this bad, I read the other reviews and thought they just got a bad product, but it's true, this watch can't seem to keep up with everything it's doing.As I was wearing the watch, my seen kept kinda hurting and when I would feel that, I would look at the bottom of the watch, and it was lasering me with a green light. I could feel the light effecting my whole arm in a negative way. And, the watch does come with a cancer warning, and if you read all the info in the product listing, you'll see. So, I guess avoid this watch if you don't want it poisoning your body and causing you harm. Don't say that I didn't warn you.And again, I am here to remind you that this watch CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT A SAMSUNG PHONE, THIS IS NOT AN INDEPENDENT DEVICE, and that fact alone makes this watch a terrible investment. I bought it for the golf capabilities, but I returned it after seeing how useless this watch really is, trust me, most of the POSITIVE REVIEWS are NOT REAL and are just so you but their product.200 bucks for a smart watch that's this dated in technology and design is an incredibly shoddy investment. I thought that was bad enough alone.... But, as soon as I received the watch, I see that they're offering this watch for 30 bucks less than what I bought it for, that's really terrible business practice.Overall, the experience of this watch is awful, and I would rather have my money back than have to be this pissed off that I wasted hundreds of dollars on a watch that's this trash. Not a wise investment. Causes cancer and harms your body. Do not recommend, 0 stars if I could. Avoid at all costs, save yourself the disappointment, save your health, protect your private health data from being spied on, and save your money, it's not worth it at all, you absolutely have to trust me, DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH! IT CAUSES CANCER!",

If you have this part figured out then buy with confidence like I did, I'm happy.I Have the 47mm variety it came pristine brand new condition in unoppened official samsung box with all standard new in box accessories. Quickly things i like are great screen size compared to other and older models, I have big wrist being 6 foot and looks good on me, wish it was slightly bigger, its much lighter than than my old galaxy watch 4 classic and other competitors in this space, battery life is 40% at end of full day use without the always on display, otherwise same as the old galaxy watch 4's so far.

Here are the things I love about it:Intuitive Setup: Getting started was straightforward, from installing apps to connecting and creating accounts. Everything synced seamlessly.Tracking: While my primary goal was to track physical activity, I was pleasantly surprised by its sleep monitoring feature. It not only tracks my sleep patterns but also offers tips to improve consistency, which is incredibly helpful.Personalization: It\u2019s easy to change watch faces or swap out bands, making it adaptable to any style or situation.Automatic Activity Recognition: The watch impressively tracks my activities automatically, even when I forget to set up a workout. Whether I\u2019m walking, rowing, following a workout video, or simply tidying up around the house, it picks up my movements accurately without manual input.Convenient Alarm Syncing: I also love how it syncs with my phone alarm. As autumn settles in here in Illinois, mornings can be dark, and alarms are easy to miss. The watch vibrates along with my phone alarm, making it harder to ignore and ensuring I get up on time.What Could Be Improved:Blood Pressure Tracking: While this isn\u2019t Samsung\u2019s fault, I wish the US allowed blood pressure monitoring on this device. I have another watch from Temu with this feature, and it\u2019s incredibly useful for seeing trends and understanding how different events impact my stress levels. It encourages me to manage stress more effectively rather than compartmentalize it.Battery Life: The battery longevity is a bit disappointing. I primarily use the watch for fitness, sleep tracking, and basic functions like stress measurement. Given my moderate usage, I expected the battery to last longer between charges, but I find myself needing to recharge it at least daily - as frequently as my phone.Final Thoughts: Despite these minor drawbacks, the Galaxy Watch 5 is well worth the investment. It\u2019s reliable, versatile, and convenient, and I believe it will last a long time. I would definitely buy it again.",

So now I am stuck with this piece of junk. That being said it is more than deserving of a one star review. If you like watches that one major feature upgrade than their counterparts but the feature absolutely does not work accurately or give you the option to check it 90% of the time I would like to introduce you to the skin temperature feature on this watch. Some how the most basic features for a smart watch is also incredibly unreliable and unavailable most of the time, this would be the heart rate monitor. Oh and I hope you like connectivity issues because that is all you are going to get with this. In the first 2 months of trying this product out it got disconnected from my phone 4 times and took days to reconnect. ( I have an android) sure this thing counts your steps but it counts a different amount then the feature my phone already includes so now I have to wonder which one is wrong. And beware the \"WiFi battery saving feature\" for some reason since the device would die much faster if it was constantly using WiFi it only uses WiFi when prompted to through specific settings/user interaction. But if course if we are having connectivity issues with everything else how surprising is it that this junky watch can't decide whether it should actually preform it's automatic setting tasks because it is capable of consistently reconnecting to the WiFi then updating these apps or tracking widgets... What ever, literally don't even try streaming anything Spotify and audiobooks that aren't downloaded are never going to consistently play for more than 2 mins. But don't worry you also won't have enough space to download music or books or too many apps, even though every app seems to need a second widget or app to operate on the watch...  Honestly not even sure how this watch is very usable it's like having a disappointment strapped to your wrist at all times. I just wish they would have honoured their window of return that was printed in bold every time I went to the return center but they are allowed to put a completely different one half way down the return instructions list. Not all of us have the time to thoroughly read the return instructions until we are ready to return... When I thought was during the return window... Very misleading",

It tracks thing like it should, its interesting to know how long you sleep and what happens and more.Just when you first get it it will have a lot of system updates, they don't put it all in one, I did have to do it 5 times and each time it would drain my battery and I'd have to recharge to 30% to update it again, this did take about 5 hours, till I could finally use and play with it, so don't be so frustrated about the situation or think something is wrong with battery like I did lol.",

There seemed to be a big drop in battery when I was first adding apps.  However, the battery lasted the evening...with a few hours to spare.  I decided to keep this watch because I like the dressy appearance.  All apps seem to work great.",

        "review": "I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch 5 (40mm Bluetooth Smartwatch), and overall, I\u2019m quite impressed. Here are the things I love about it:Intuitive Setup: Getting started was straightforward, from installing apps to connecting and creating accounts. Everything synced seamlessly.Tracking: While my primary goal was to track physical activity, I was pleasantly surprised by its sleep monitoring feature. It not only tracks my sleep patterns but also offers tips to improve consistency, which is incredibly helpful.Personalization: It\u2019s easy to change watch faces or swap out bands, making it adaptable to any style or situation.Automatic Activity Recognition: The watch impressively tracks my activities automatically, even when I forget to set up a workout. Whether I\u2019m walking, rowing, following a workout video, or simply tidying up around the house, it picks up my movements accurately without manual input.Convenient Alarm Syncing: I also love how it syncs with my phone alarm. As autumn settles in here in Illinois, mornings can be dark, and alarms are easy to miss. The watch vibrates along with my phone alarm, making it harder to ignore and ensuring I get up on time.What Could Be Improved:Blood Pressure Tracking: While this isn\u2019t Samsung\u2019s fault, I wish the US allowed blood pressure monitoring on this device. I have another watch from Temu with this feature, and it\u2019s incredibly useful for seeing trends and understanding how different events impact my stress levels. It encourages me to manage stress more effectively rather than compartmentalize it.Battery Life: The battery longevity is a bit disappointing. I primarily use the watch for fitness, sleep tracking, and basic functions like stress measurement. Given my moderate usage, I expected the battery to last longer between charges, but I find myself needing to recharge it at least daily - as frequently as my phone.Final Thoughts: Despite these minor drawbacks, the Galaxy Watch 5 is well worth the investment. It\u2019s reliable, versatile, and convenient, and I believe it will last a long time. I would definitely buy it again.",

        "review": "I was hesitant to write this review because I was planning on returning the watch due to the heinous software consistency but for some reason they are allowed to put a longer return window on the Amazon return date than they actually accept. So now I am stuck with this piece of junk. That being said it is more than deserving of a one star review. If you like watches that one major feature upgrade than their counterparts but the feature absolutely does not work accurately or give you the option to check it 90% of the time I would like to introduce you to the skin temperature feature on this watch. Some how the most basic features for a smart watch is also incredibly unreliable and unavailable most of the time, this would be the heart rate monitor. Oh and I hope you like connectivity issues because that is all you are going to get with this. In the first 2 months of trying this product out it got disconnected from my phone 4 times and took days to reconnect. ( I have an android) sure this thing counts your steps but it counts a different amount then the feature my phone already includes so now I have to wonder which one is wrong. And beware the \"WiFi battery saving feature\" for some reason since the device would die much faster if it was constantly using WiFi it only uses WiFi when prompted to through specific settings/user interaction. But if course if we are having connectivity issues with everything else how surprising is it that this junky watch can't decide whether it should actually preform it's automatic setting tasks because it is capable of consistently reconnecting to the WiFi then updating these apps or tracking widgets... What ever, literally don't even try streaming anything Spotify and audiobooks that aren't downloaded are never going to consistently play for more than 2 mins. But don't worry you also won't have enough space to download music or books or too many apps, even though every app seems to need a second widget or app to operate on the watch...  Honestly not even sure how this watch is very usable it's like having a disappointment strapped to your wrist at all times. I just wish they would have honoured their window of return that was printed in bold every time I went to the return center but they are allowed to put a completely different one half way down the return instructions list. Not all of us have the time to thoroughly read the return instructions until we are ready to return... When I thought was during the return window... Very misleading",

Previously we've owned Fitbits and they are fine but the Sanding Galaxy has more features and bigger face. We like the fitness and sleep features also we can check any heart related issues such as BPM, Blood Pressure and for me any time I may feel like I may be in A- Fib. These devices have all the features you may need and is alot less expense than Apple or Woot with their monthly service cost.  Only Draw back and i'm not sure why, is that we need to change it more frequently than we'd like, otherwise it is a great value and great quality for your money.",

        "review": "I couldn\u2019t be happier with my upgrade to the galaxy 7 watch. I loved my galaxy 4 watch and therefore struggled with my decision to replace it until I received the 7 and started to use it. I thought the 4 was just fine with one big flaw\u2026whenever I would use my Samsung clock app to set reminders, the reminder would go off on my phone but I was not able to dismiss it on my watch. Really annoying and it just seemed like a huge oversight on Samsung to not have their watch integrate with their clock app. I set a lot of reminders for everything, so this was a annoyance at least six times a day. Much to my delight the first time one of my reminders went off after putting on my watch I was able to swipe away the reminder that was ringing on my phone in another room! Other things I really like about it are the sleep apnea test, and just the overall smoothness of swiping between screens in the responsiveness of the screen even with a screen protector on it I\u2019m sure there are lots of other things. I would begin to appreciate, but about the upgrade, but for now, the alarm integration was worth the price. Love that it was available for a big discount due to the expected release of the Galaxy 8 watch.",

        "review": "Yes, the price is real.  Yes, there's a catch.  This watch is the International Edition that is registered for use ONLY in SE Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, etc.).  You cannot select regions outside of that on the watch and must instead set the region on your Samsung Account (using your phone).  However, this watch is fully compatible with ALL official accessories and comes in a real Samsung box with intact quality seal.  There are dozens of bands, cases, etc. in enough colors to make anyone happy.The watch itself is kind of a glorified sensor and your Galaxy phone does all the heavy lifting.  Note that US customers do NOT have access to the heart monitoring features (ECG/blood pressure).  It will simply say \"this function not available in your region\" and refuse to let you go further. However, it does measure blood oxygen, body composition, sleep parameters, etc.  It's also fairly stylish and the 40mm watch face is PLENTY big enough.  You can use your phone to download many kinds of useful watch faces, apps and such and push them to the watch. Using the Samsung Wear and Health apps (pre-installed on all Galaxy phones) makes using this pretty easy.  You can also take calls on it and the sound quality is good.  The other person might not even know you're using your watch!The watch charges with a little magnetic disk only as it has no ports on it.  You MUST use a magnetic charger.  You can get some second-party chargers that work.  The battery life, as with all smart watches, is pretty bad.  You will get through a day or so of light use but no more.  It wants you to wear it at night but it won't last that long so I tend to charge it up while I eat dinner so it will be topped off when I go to bed. A bonus is that the charger for it works well with external battery packs and connects pretty strongly so you can charge it in your bag if you were on a bus or plane. It also connects only with Bluetooth, so if you are in Airplane Mode, you will need to activate Bluetooth in Airplane Mode to get the watch to connect.The band is kind of wonky as the excess band goes UNDER the strap and not over it as a Casio band or typical band, but it's soft and the holes are numerous and finely spaced to give a good fit.  I like the way it feels and it seems quite sporty.  You can get other bands if you really want to change up the way it looks.Overall, this watch is pretty nice.  I have chargers at the office and home and I use the little included one in my travel bag. I am sure that, in 10 years, we will laugh at how primitive our watches were, but, for now, this is one of the best accessories for your Galaxy phone.  I believe it's a better deal than the Google watch and will probably be getting some of these for my family come Christmas.  I am only removing one star because the battery life is so wonky and the ECG feature isn't working.",

I was so excited to finally own a Samsung smart watch, and boy was I let down.I read all the negative reviews about this watch, but was hypnotized by the features it says it has, and happily spent 270 bucks on the watch and the 3 year protection plan, only to be upset that the watch is a complete paper weight. The reviews are true, the battery life sucks, none of the apps are worth anything at all.I never use Samsung Health on my phone and it's equally as terrible of an experience on the watch, just completely inaccurate readings and pointless options, totally not helpful at all. The watch will download apps just to tell you that you need to also download the app to your phone, and then sign up for an account using the phone, not the watch, and you have to do this to even use whatever app it is that you want on your watch. In other words, the watch is not an independent device, it depends on your Samsung phone for everything, and that's a really poor user experience. I am returning this watch with the intentions of never buying a Samsung smart watch ever again. The 6 is even more horrible than this. I'm not impressed with these \"smart\" watches at all.In short: The volume for this watch is so quiet, health readings are a joke and report the wrong information, the apps are severely limited in functionality and design, typing on this thing is so cringe, you can't insert a period on the keyboard without switching the entire keyboard to special characters, so there goes all your easy .com entries, the Samsung Internet Browser is a POS and never scrolls the page correctly, trying to scroll around on the screen to show the edges of the pages is awful, the screen is incredibly small, navigation on this watch is atrocious, and the watch is incredibly laggy and unresponsive at times, more often than not.Beware: There's at least 1 hour of updates waiting for you. The watch arrives with no battery charge, so don't expect to be able to use it right out of the box, because you're going to be waiting for about 4 hours before you can fully use it when you have to deal with so many updates and charging the watch even you first get it. After wasting 2 days just to see if I even like the watch, I'm baffled at how much I actually dislike it. I love Samsung products, but I can't believe how trash this watch actually is, especially with this sky high price tag. After everything I've just seen, including wicked fast battery drain when you have to use the screen a lot, I personally value this watch at about 30 bucks, and not a single cent more, and that's being generous. The lack of features, user experience, and independence from the phone itself devalued this thing by a lot. It's outdated and obsolete gadgetry. I am not even exaggerating with the battery life being this bad, I read the other reviews and thought they just got a bad product, but it's true, this watch can't seem to keep up with everything it's doing.As I was wearing the watch, my seen kept kinda hurting and when I would feel that, I would look at the bottom of the watch, and it was lasering me with a green light. I could feel the light effecting my whole arm in a negative way. And, the watch does come with a cancer warning, and if you read all the info in the product listing, you'll see. So, I guess avoid this watch if you don't want it poisoning your body and causing you harm. Don't say that I didn't warn you.And again, I am here to remind you that this watch CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT A SAMSUNG PHONE, THIS IS NOT AN INDEPENDENT DEVICE, and that fact alone makes this watch a terrible investment. I bought it for the golf capabilities, but I returned it after seeing how useless this watch really is, trust me, most of the POSITIVE REVIEWS are NOT REAL and are just so you but their product.200 bucks for a smart watch that's this dated in technology and design is an incredibly shoddy investment. I thought that was bad enough alone.... But, as soon as I received the watch, I see that they're offering this watch for 30 bucks less than what I bought it for, that's really terrible business practice.Overall, the experience of this watch is awful, and I would rather have my money back than have to be this pissed off that I wasted hundreds of dollars on a watch that's this trash. Not a wise investment. Causes cancer and harms your body. Do not recommend, 0 stars if I could. Avoid at all costs, save yourself the disappointment, save your health, protect your private health data from being spied on, and save your money, it's not worth it at all, you absolutely have to trust me, DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH!

I actually used the flashlight feature last night while my tiny was sleeping so I could move around without turning a light on, and that worked great. The battery isn't too bad for my purposes.

Anyway, it's on par with what my non-refurbished old watch used to get, so I'm very happy about that.The battery was dead when it arrived, but I got it charging and used my phone to do most of my set-up while it juiced. The other nice thing was a lot of my stuff transferred from my old watch to the new, so I didn't have to add back my alarms and stuff. That was swell. I also like that the watch can do sound alarms, and they're not super annoying or obtrusive.All-in-all, good watch. Happy I took a chance on the refurbished. And the size is just perfect for me, too.I did manage to scratch it already (I just got it this past weekish), but I have a toddler and I'm a klutz, so that's probably my doing anyway.I would like to suggest NEVER taking it swimming, or even in the shower, even though there's tracking for swimming and a \"water lock\".

The app is no longer applicable to this watch version, so I can't do a factory reset to fix it. I've ordered the new Galaxy S25 from Samsung which is how I found out about the app.I have always been a Samsung customer, phones, computers, etc.  I had a Fitbit Versa 2 and it finally died.  All I want from a wearable device is number of steps walked, heart rate, and the sleep information.  I know the Samsung has many more capabilities, but these are all I want to use (plus the time of day).  When mine came I only set the above readings to be active. I like the look of the watch and I would be happy if it would just work. After charging it and it charges quickly the battery lasts about 6 hours.  This past week it has begun to charge sometimes and other times I'll pick it up and all it will show is 0% and the icon indicating it needs to be charged.  I've done everything I know to do in the app and on the Samsung site.  If anyone out there has a suggestion as to how to fix it, please let me know through Amazon's messaging system.  I like the fit and everything about the watch, but it just won't hold a charge.  Thanks",

I am very happy with it.I bought it for work, so I could leave my phone in my bag but still be able to see phone calls or messages. (I have 2 autistic kids, I need to be reachable). I sweat to much at work to keep my phone in my pocket, it tends to be loud at work, and I dont feel the vibration in my pocket when I'm moving. All causing me to miss important calls and messages. This watch is my solution.I've tried other brands in the past and they were not reliable at all. The connectivity is very good on this one, I can be several feet from my bag and have no problems. Messages and phone calls come thru every time.Although I did not buy this for the fitness features, I will say they are neat. I work in a factory and I find it amusing that it starts an auto workout whenever I'm packing. Its interesting to see the results at the end of the day. I have not used this for sleep, I mainly only wear it at work. In doing so, I only need to charge it every 3ish days, the charge holds well. And it only takes an hour and a half or so to charge.The app is easy to use and I like all the options available to customize.I was very nervous buying renewed. But so far I am beyond happy with this watch. There is absolutely nothing to indicate it had ever been used. It works as it should and has held up well getting banged around at work. I also like that it is not really big or bulky.I did replace the band with a silicone break away band for work. I like the new band better as the original was very stiff on the sides.Did not come in original packaging,  which is fine,  I expected that.The watch literally looks like it was never worn. Not a scuff or smudge anywhere.Fired up and synced with the app with no problems.Seems to work as its supposed to so far. Calls and messages received. I like the customization.But since this is renewed, I'm skeptical.  I will update after I've had it a while and see how it holds up.",

The stylish look makes it a great accessory, and the easy-to-read display is a huge plus\u2014especially when I\u2019m on the go. I can easily check messages and track my workouts without any hassle, and it\u2019s comfortable enough to wear all day without feeling bulky.However, I do wish the battery life were a bit better. By the time I get home from work, it\u2019s almost dead, which can be a bit frustrating. Thankfully, I just plug it in to charge overnight, so it\u2019s ready to go for the next day. Despite this minor drawback, I\u2019m really happy with my purchase overall. If you\u2019re looking for a reliable smartwatch that combines functionality with style, this is a great choice",

The app is no longer applicable to this watch version, so I can't do a factory reset to fix it. I've ordered the new Galaxy S25 from Samsung which is how I found out about the app.I have always been a Samsung customer, phones, computers, etc.  I had a Fitbit Versa 2 and it finally died.  All I want from a wearable device is number of steps walked, heart rate, and the sleep information.  I know the Samsung has many more capabilities, but these are all I want to use (plus the time of day).  When mine came I only set the above readings to be active. I like the look of the watch and I would be happy if it would just work. After charging it and it charges quickly the battery lasts about 6 hours.  This past week it has begun to charge sometimes and other times I'll pick it up and all it will show is 0% and the icon indicating it needs to be charged.  I've done everything I know to do in the app and on the Samsung site.  If anyone out there has a suggestion as to how to fix it, please let me know through Amazon's messaging system.  I like the fit and everything about the watch, but it just won't hold a charge.  Thanks",

If you have this part figured out then buy with confidence like I did, I'm happy.I Have the 47mm variety it came pristine brand new condition in unoppened official samsung box with all standard new in box accessories. Quickly things i like are great screen size compared to other and older models, I have big wrist being 6 foot and looks good on me, wish it was slightly bigger, its much lighter than than my old galaxy watch 4 classic and other competitors in this space, battery life is 40% at end of full day use without the always on display, otherwise same as the old galaxy watch 4's so far.

You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit. A black band would put more focus on the watch itself.",

I haven't kept up on watches, had the original Samsung watch, loved the looks, but was worthless to me because I couldn't even make it through a work day without charging. My fitbit died, so I went looking, saw reviews talking about battery and saw the price and went for it. Then the 7 came out and I felt like I made a mistake.I certainly did not. This thing is a beast on the battery. I get a ton of notifications, reply to them, play around on it, and easily get more than 2 days of use. I typically just charge it in the mornings as I get ready for work. Yes, I wear it as I sleep for tracking.The 'renewed' or whatever this is, is great. Not a scratch on it, looks absolutely brand new. The charger they send with sucks. Sucks really bad. Order yourself an OEM charger and toss the one that comes with it right away, or else you'll be charging an hour a day...

I'm a Galaxy girl and have all Samsung devices so it fits right in.First, the watch shipped without original packaging - there were a couple comments that said they received all the original packaging so I was initially a little bummed about that.

The 6 came in OEM packaging and while I preferred the size of the watch 6, the battery life couldn't come close to the 5 Pro.

I was worried because this model indicated it is the Latin America version, but it works just like the other 5 Pro.The watch is huge and I have very small wrists so it has been an adjustment wearing something so bulky. The OEM band was too big for me and even though I made it work, the excess strap caused an awkward fit. I replaced the band with a thinner silicone band and it is much more comfortable now.That said, the features that it offers are impressive. My favorites: body composition analysis, sleep tracking, integration with Samsung Health and my fitness apps such as GymRun & MyNetDiary. I also love being able to get messages and texts without having to pick up my phone. This watch is a key motivator in helping me achieve my fitness goals so for that aspect alone, worth the refreshed cost! I definitely won't hesitate to buy Amazon Refreshed for other items in the future, just know that there is a spectrum of what you'll get.",

        "review": "So I ended up buying this watch about a week before the 7 series dropped. I haven't kept up on watches, had the original Samsung watch, loved the looks, but was worthless to me because I couldn't even make it through a work day without charging. My fitbit died, so I went looking, saw reviews talking about battery and saw the price and went for it. Then the 7 came out and I felt like I made a mistake.I certainly did not. This thing is a beast on the battery. I get a ton of notifications, reply to them, play around on it, and easily get more than 2 days of use. I typically just charge it in the mornings as I get ready for work. Yes, I wear it as I sleep for tracking.The 'renewed' or whatever this is, is great. Not a scratch on it, looks absolutely brand new. The charger they send with sucks. Sucks really bad. Order yourself an OEM charger and toss the one that comes with it right away, or else you'll be charging an hour a day... With the OEM you do not need to do that.It's big, it's light on the wrist with the titanium, I'm extremely rough on watches, each Fitbit I owned was scratched up within days, after a couple of weeks, this still doesn't have a mark on it.

        "review": "I've had a 4 Classic since 2021 and there's enough to like about it that I haven't seen a watch I'd rather have. The battery life is the biggest downside. You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit. A black band would put more focus on the watch itself.",

I paid 400 when this watch released back In 2021, It got water damage. Then I decided to buy this refurbished watch, it was great but I lost it in a week, but Keep in mind it didnt come with the original cable, but that was okay to me because I still have the original cable from the other watch, and if youre wondering.

        "review": "I've had a 4 Classic since 2021 and there's enough to like about it that I haven't seen a watch I'd rather have. The battery life is the biggest downside. You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit. A black band would put more focus on the watch itself.",

The rotating bezel, advanced health and fitness features, and Wear OS functionality make it a versatile choice for Android users, especially those who want to track their health and stay connected on the go. While the battery life could be better, the fast charging feature helps mitigate this concern.

The reviews are true, the battery life sucks, none of the apps are worth anything at all.I never use Samsung Health on my phone and it's equally as terrible of an experience on the watch, just completely inaccurate readings and pointless options, totally not helpful at all. The watch will download apps just to tell you that you need to also download the app to your phone, and then sign up for an account using the phone, not the watch, and you have to do this to even use whatever app it is that you want on your watch. In other words, the watch is not an independent device, it depends on your Samsung phone for everything, and that's a really poor user experience. I am returning this watch with the intentions of never buying a Samsung smart watch ever again. The 6 is even more horrible than this. I'm not impressed with these \"smart\" watches at all.In short: The volume for this watch is so quiet, health readings are a joke and report the wrong information, the apps are severely limited in functionality and design, typing on this thing is so cringe, you can't insert a period on the keyboard without switching the entire keyboard to special characters, so there goes all your easy .com entries, the Samsung Internet Browser is a POS and never scrolls the page correctly, trying to scroll around on the screen to show the edges of the pages is awful, the screen is incredibly small, navigation on this watch is atrocious, and the watch is incredibly laggy and unresponsive at times, more often than not.Beware: There's at least 1 hour of updates waiting for you. The watch arrives with no battery charge, so don't expect to be able to use it right out of the box, because you're going to be waiting for about 4 hours before you can fully use it when you have to deal with so many updates and charging the watch even you first get it. After wasting 2 days just to see if I even like the watch, I'm baffled at how much I actually dislike it. I love Samsung products, but I can't believe how trash this watch actually is, especially with this sky high price tag. After everything I've just seen, including wicked fast battery drain when you have to use the screen a lot, I personally value this watch at about 30 bucks, and not a single cent more, and that's being generous. The lack of features, user experience, and independence from the phone itself devalued this thing by a lot. It's outdated and obsolete gadgetry. I am not even exaggerating with the battery life being this bad, I read the other reviews and thought they just got a bad product, but it's true, this watch can't seem to keep up with everything it's doing.As I was wearing the watch, my seen kept kinda hurting and when I would feel that, I would look at the bottom of the watch, and it was lasering me with a green light. I could feel the light effecting my whole arm in a negative way. And, the watch does come with a cancer warning, and if you read all the info in the product listing, you'll see. So, I guess avoid this watch if you don't want it poisoning your body and causing you harm. Don't say that I didn't warn you.And again, I am here to remind you that this watch CANNOT FUNCTION WITHOUT A SAMSUNG PHONE, THIS IS NOT AN INDEPENDENT DEVICE, and that fact alone makes this watch a terrible investment.

The app is no longer applicable to this watch version, so I can't do a factory reset to fix it. I've ordered the new Galaxy S25 from Samsung which is how I found out about the app.I have always been a Samsung customer, phones, computers, etc.  I had a Fitbit Versa 2 and it finally died.  All I want from a wearable device is number of steps walked, heart rate, and the sleep information.  I know the Samsung has many more capabilities, but these are all I want to use (plus the time of day).  When mine came I only set the above readings to be active. I like the look of the watch and I would be happy if it would just work. After charging it and it charges quickly the battery lasts about 6 hours.  This past week it has begun to charge sometimes and other times I'll pick it up and all it will show is 0% and the icon indicating it needs to be charged.  I've done everything I know to do in the app and on the Samsung site.  If anyone out there has a suggestion as to how to fix it, please let me know through Amazon's messaging system.

This watch is my solution.I've tried other brands in the past and they were not reliable at all. The connectivity is very good on this one, I can be several feet from my bag and have no problems. Messages and phone calls come thru every time.Although I did not buy this for the fitness features, I will say they are neat. I work in a factory and I find it amusing that it starts an auto workout whenever I'm packing. Its interesting to see the results at the end of the day. I have not used this for sleep, I mainly only wear it at work. In doing so, I only need to charge it every 3ish days, the charge holds well. And it only takes an hour and a half or so to charge.The app is easy to use and I like all the options available to customize.I was very nervous buying renewed. But so far I am beyond happy with this watch. There is absolutely nothing to indicate it had ever been used. It works as it should and has held up well getting banged around at work. I also like that it is not really big or bulky.I did replace the band with a silicone break away band for work. I like the new band better as the original was very stiff on the sides.Did not come in original packaging,  which is fine,  I expected that.The watch literally looks like it was never worn. Not a scuff or smudge anywhere.Fired up and synced with the app with no problems.Seems to work as its supposed to so far. Calls and messages received. I like the customization.But since this is renewed, I'm skeptical.  I will update after I've had it a while and see how it holds up.",

The app is no longer applicable to this watch version, so I can't do a factory reset to fix it. I've ordered the new Galaxy S25 from Samsung which is how I found out about the app.I have always been a Samsung customer, phones, computers, etc.  I had a Fitbit Versa 2 and it finally died.  All I want from a wearable device is number of steps walked, heart rate, and the sleep information.  I know the Samsung has many more capabilities, but these are all I want to use (plus the time of day).  When mine came I only set the above readings to be active. I like the look of the watch and I would be happy if it would just work. After charging it and it charges quickly the battery lasts about 6 hours.  This past week it has begun to charge sometimes and other times I'll pick it up and all it will show is 0% and the icon indicating it needs to be charged.  I've done everything I know to do in the app and on the Samsung site.  If anyone out there has a suggestion as to how to fix it, please let me know through Amazon's messaging system.  I like the fit and everything about the watch, but it just won't hold a charge.  Thanks",

      {
        "review": "Had this watch for about a week now. I was initially hesitant about the purchase, as this is my first smart watch. After research, and getting acquainted with the tool, I'm so happy I pulled the trigger. I use it every day for surprisingly detailed sleep tracking, enhanced step/activity tracking, ease of checking notifications and responding when I don't have easy access to my phone (or if I'm not supposed to at work), and on top of all of that, it's just a fantastic looking watch. The amount of functions you have access to is fantastic. I have paid more in my life for a watch that literally could only tell time. Lol. I know the health monitoring data may not be spot on, but it has really helped me focus on the right things during day to day. If you're on the fence, do it. If you have a Samsung phone, definitely do it.Some tips:1.) I recommend the first thing you do is order the official Samsung wireless charger to go with it. The charger shipped with this watch is off-brand and charges at about 5 watts, which takes about 2.5-3 hours. The Samsung charger provides 10 watt fast charging which takes 90 minutes at most. Again, the included charger is aftermarket, and slooowww. Get the Samsung one. The battery life on this watch is good, but not phenomenal, so having a faster charger is key to low stress ownership. These smart devices take at least one or two charge cycles to optimize battery use, so be patient with the first couple of battery cycles. I got one day out of the first two, then started getting a full 2 days easy, with slight tweaks to functions, but still fairly liberal use. I've attached screen shots of my batter usage stats after the break in period. If you want to have everything running all day at full capacity, again definitely get the Samsung charger so you can juice up faster after a day of heavy use.2.) This is not a brand new watch. It was manufactured in 2022, and used by a previous owner for years. Do not expect it to be in perfect cosmetic condition. For the price, I think this is reasonable (approx $100 vs $400 new when it came out). Mine has a couple of blemishes, but the screen is in excellent condition. Still looks great to my eye! Consider getting a case and screen protector.3.) I also recommend taking some rubbing alcohol, a micro fiber cloth, and some q-tips to the watch on arrival. The refurbishing on it is okay, but I did still clean off a thin layer of built up grime from the previous owner, especially in some hard to reach spots.4.) If you are fairly active I recommend getting a different band for the watch. The OEM rubber one ends up slipping all over anytime I build up a sweat. If I try to tighten it enough to stay still, it ends up pinching and cutting off blood flow. I work in food service, so having to constantly readjust the position through my shift has been annoying. I also have slim wrists, and forums seem to say the \"no gap\" bands are to be avoided. You want that gap so the band can bend down from the mounting point to provide more wrist contact.In summary: This watch has been a super enjoyable addition to my health tracking, Samsung ecosystem, and just general gadgets I use on the daily. I love it! Still giving it 5 stars despite the effort I've had to put in to make everything work right for me, because the price is an absolute steal. I don't have money for a brand new smart watch, but this one still holds its own with the current market, from what I've gathered, and even provides better battery life than a lot of brand new watches.",

        "review": "Like many others, I got the watch refurbished to save half off the sticker, which is still pricey for a last gen model. I figured since Amazon was fulfilling the order, it would be easier and safer to replace a defective one if I got unlucky (as I have been burned before and am very wary of renewed products).It's been about a week and to be honest I was expecting glitches, but none have yet to be found! The refurbishing partner clearly knows what they're doing in fixing up their tech. The original seller listed for my purchase was Chubbiestech.The only thing to be aware of is that there is clear evidence that this is an opened and refurbished product - adhesive remnants around the face edge and some scuff marks around the ring were the first things I noticed upon opening the package. That being said, these were very minor blemishes that I ended up covering anyway with a watch case. The screen itself is completely clear of any scratches or marks, and so far responds to touch very well.The operating system seems to respond at a fair speed. Not having owned a brand new version of this same watch, I can't say much more than this. By general \"feeling\" of OS responsiveness, this watch could maybe be smoother as it sometimes hesitates or stutters between changing screens. However, it could very well be the limitation of Samsung's OS itself and not anything to do with the refurbishment.Battery life has also been fair - the watch would last me about 72 hours as a moderate user (daily exercise, step count, HR monitor every 10 minutes, overnight for sleep tracking). Heavier use (music, phone calls) brings down the battery a lot faster as to be expected, but I see it lasting at minimum 24 hours without charge. Charging takes about 20 minutes to juice up ~30%, so I can expect a full charge in 1 hour as long as the watch isn't dead. I did not receive a Samsung charger, but the unbranded one works just as well.Overall, super happy about this purchase, and even happier for getting it basically half off the market price for a brand new one!",

Being a fan of Casio watches I hoped they would have one. They have watches that vibrate, but none with multiple alarms. I tried a few off-brand smart watches, they were a pain to use. I really didn't want to spend 300 bucks on a watch to have this seeming simple feature. On a whim, I decided to try a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. 99 bucks, and if it doesn't do the trick, I'll return it and continue searching. This watch does it! Yay! The fact that I can set it up from my phone is an added bonus; being 65, my eyes ain't what they used to be. So I got various alarms set up (coffee brew, wings on the grill, etc.) and was pretty happy. I don't really care about all the health stuff. What really pleased me was when I was listening to music from my Plex server on a Plex HTPC. I was controlling the music from my computer, but also had Plexamp open on my phone. All of a sudden I look at my watch, and there is a Plexamp interface! Whoa! I can control the tunes from my phone too! How awesome is that?!

        "review": "Just a great watch. I love how for 40 bux you can change the face to your tast for the day all year. If you spend this much money, at least get Facer or in my opinion you've wasted your money,  cause the faces is where it's at for me. I was certain I didn't need the lte but would have gotten it for sure if I knew than what I know now. I have no regrets just would have gotten it. I love the black, but sort of wish I would have gone with silver cause of the bands you can buy. It's a very good feeling watch nice and heavy.Change the band immediately unless you like to live in discomfort and protect the bezel not the screen. Trust me and if you insist on screen protector the inner are you will put it on is like bevel or cone shaped so if the glass isn't you'll regret it \ud83e\udd2d add tons of music and pictures easy to use and change. Turn your notifications sound to vibrate and minimal sounds or when it gets to updates you'll be a very noisy fellow. And turn your screen to AOD and only push button to wake. Battery is good but not for the first month when it's figuring out your usage patterns I wish you can adjust the speed with your bezel turn you have to turn it like one whole rotation to scroll like 3/4\" of page and also the direction. For some reason I'd rather turn it the other direction. Watch is a 5/5 still but dont expect it to be miraculous. It's just a watch with smart features and incredible if you  are into fitness which I'm not. Love how it works when I jump on my bike and when I'm off it's very accurate with steps and bike riding.Spend the money and buy something you will use everyday. We'll worth it for the price. Get it used if you can or you'll spend like 40 bux for the price of Tape you'll cut anyway\ud83e\udee3",

If it's a smarty watch I wasn't to use it for all of its functions, this battery life really does suck. Then an hour to fully charge? Ridiculous,  I hope not.",

        "review": "Bought this in black and its perfect! Great option if you have a small wrist like me, this size of the screen is a great fit for petite wrists along with your \"average wrist\". I couldn't decide if I wanted this size or bigger and I am SO glad I went with this size!! I changed the band on mine because I didn't find the one it came with to be very comfortable. Its durable and connects easily via bluetooth. If you are like me and don't want to pay for a watch service through your mobile network but would like to still enjoy a smart watch that answers phone calls, and text messages then this is great! I obviously can't go too far away from my phone or my bluetooth will disconnect and I can't use the call/texts features BUT the reach is pretty far I have never had an issue. I can text and answer calls even with my phone being in the other room. I also LOVE this \"find my phone\" feature when I misplace my phone (which is often). If you are in the market for a smartwatch I recommend this one!",

        "review": "Great smartwatch, but battery life could be improvedI bought this watch in \"Used as New\" condition, and it really exceeded my expectations. The watch arrived in perfect condition, as if it were new, and I haven't noticed any difference in performance.The design is impeccable: elegant, light and comfortable to wear all day. The screen is wonderful, with vivid colors and excellent brightness that allows it to be used without problems even in the sun. In addition, the functions are complete and practical, from health monitoring to notifications and integration with my phone.The only drawback is that I would have liked the battery to last a little longer.Still, I am very satisfied with the purchase. It is a great smartwatch that delivers what it promises, and the shopping experience on Amazon was also excellent.",

        "review": "really wanted to keep this watch as the 40 mm size was perfect and loved the features.My use case was very simple, using it as a stand alone cycling fitness tracker that syncs to Strava fitness app.  I wanted it to record my miles ridden with gps and also leave my phone at home and still be able to make phone calls in case of emergency. Everything was working fine even though the miles tracked with gps were about a tenth of a mile off from my phone for every ten miles ridden. I could tell from the gps map of my ride using both the watch and the phone that my phone was able to track more accurately. There was less variability in the gps signal.Ok, so I could live with gps being off by a mile over a 100 mile bike ride.I was also comfortable with the battery life. Seemed like I could get a good 7hours or more using cellular, gps tracking, and data service. The rest of my day I didn't even wear the watch.The deal breaker for me was the lack of external heart rate monitor support.Shocker!  I have seen reviews saying how the heart rate tracking for the samsungs weren't that good and I had an external polar heart rate monitor I wanted to use. Well, I could not do that. I could not get my motorola phone to recognize the HR Monitor via bluetooth. I researched some and found some people had luck getting it to work with a little effort but only with a Samsung phone. Mine was a motorola.Sorry, but I need an external hr sensor so that was the deal breaker since I know the google pixel watch and the apple watches support that.If you're not picky like me and can live with the less accurate heart rate tracking built  into the watch then it's a great device and probably the best android based watch. I really didn't want to have to move to the apple eco system just for a watch.",

The size of the watch is normal but the band for the 40mm is small/medium so I had to get a third party watch band to fit my wrist. The battery life in general lasts around 2 days without AOD on. One thing to note, the first day you receive the watch it will look like the battery is draining super quick, that's normal. Just charge it until it's 100% and fully updated. Then the battery life will be fixed! The workout tracking is good and picked up a workout while I was moving stuff to a car so that was really interesting!",

The sleep tracker has more features than I'm used to. It will actually track multiple sessions of sleep in one night. I tend to wake up after a couple hours for 30 to 40 minutes and fall back asleep. My previous watch wouldn't track this. This watch catches all of my sleep time and rates it together. It gives you an energy score which is actually seeming pretty accurate. It also gives me very good insight into the things I need to do to improve my sleep hygiene. I've been working on this a lot and I still got a lot of good new useful information. I have large hands and wrists, the watch fits me great. It would probably fit from a man's small wrist up to even larger than mine.",

The watch looks very good and has no scratches, knicks, or damages of any kind! The size of the watch is normal but the band for the 40mm is small/medium so I had to get a third party watch band to fit my wrist. The battery life in general lasts around 2 days without AOD on. One thing to note, the first day you receive the watch it will look like the battery is draining super quick, that's normal. Just charge it until it's 100% and fully updated. Then the battery life will be fixed! The workout tracking is good and picked up a workout while I was moving stuff to a car so that was really interesting!",

        "review": "Love it! I got an Amazon renewed one and it is perfect quality, just like any Samsung product (and received as a brand new one would come, in box etc). Very nice looking as well and not one scratch on renewed watch either! The watch was very easy to link with my Galaxy S23. I've had it for several months and no issues. The battery life is amazing. It's comfortable too. Great value!I was worried the color of the bezel would look too gold, however it does not. I purchased a separate stainless silver-link watch band, and a clear bezel protector. The bezel matches the band perfectly, it looks silver (I think it is actually a light tone gold, but blends well). The original band is nice too, I just wanted a more \"dressy\" look.",
