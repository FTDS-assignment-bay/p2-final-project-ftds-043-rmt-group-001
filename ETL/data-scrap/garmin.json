        "review": "I decided to order a Garmin Vivoactive 5 when my Fitbit Versa expired on me in Nov.2024.  It took a couple of weeks for it to arrive, mainly due to the holiday season, but it has been worth it.  The battery life on it is much longer than what I previously had on Fitbit, and there are a lot of features available.  It will take a while to familiarize yourself with so many features, but once you do they will be worth it.  If you use it to monitor your workouts, as I do, there are many categories of workouts that it will evaluate, running, walking, strength workouts, biking, cardio, etc.  You get great data on your sleep patterns, morning reports, weather updates, etc.  What I enjoy is that when you download the Garmin app on your phone you can use your data from Garmin to enter into competitions with other Garmin members.  Fitbit, once bought out by Google, began to eliminate a lot of the groups and competitions you could be involved in, so Garmin was a breath of fresh air in this.  The band on the watch feels great and the watch looks stylish.  I am sure that there are a ton more features out there that I have not even gotten to yet, but my impressions on a Garmin smartwatch is that they are definitely worth the money if you enjoy using a smartwatch daily.",

        "review": "I really like that you can turn the heart rate on or off, gps, on or off etc basically turning all emfs so you can wear it without those harmful effects and only turn them on when working out. The battery life works well and long. My husband and I have the same watch and wear it together. Occasionally his will say he ran a little further (for example mine will say I ran 1 mi while his will say .9 or 1.1) I have noticed the longer distances make the accuracy closer to the same. I love that you can customize the brightness and colors. We\u2019ve set our face clock to more warm lighting so that even at night it isn\u2019t too awful  bright and yet it\u2019s still visible in the sun. I got the white and love the aesthetic. I also haven\u2019t noticed it yellow or easily discolor. Feels great on and doesn\u2019t rub while running. Doesn\u2019t feel too heavy either. For what you get the price was right. I got mine on sale for about $200.",

It reminds you to get up and move, counts your steps, tracks if you take naps, tracks regular sleep, measures your heart, syncs with your alarm outside of the Garmin program.... This is very efficient. Helps wake me up! Can see who's calling you, without checking your phone... Is a bonus. It even gives you positive affirmations in the morning. It helps with my depression recovery. I LOVE it. My first time trying such technology.",

        "review": "Four stars out of five - it does a lot of things very well, but lacks some features that I thought it had because of the description on the Garmin web page - most notable the inability to track respiration during workouts.  It does track respiration all day, so this must just be a software issue to get you to buy a more expensive version.  The watch faces are a little finicky to design, but there are a lot of them on the Connect IQ shop (some free, some not).I've worn an A brand watch that works seamlessly with my iPhone since they first came out.  I would say that that watch is an outstanding smart watch with a mediocre fitness tracker.  This Garmin Vivoactive 5 (they now have the 6 released) is an excellent fitness tracker with an average smart watch.  It pairs with the Garmin App and gives you much better granularity into your fitness metrics.  It has a solid battery life - my first test lasted six days before it went into low battery mode and I used it for about 12 hours of workouts (which is a battery drain).  The best feature for me is that it allows me to put all my workouts (including my cycling with a Garmin 1030)  into one location, Garmin Connect.Overall, it isn't a replacement for my smart watch, but it is a great entry level fitness tracker.  I'm planning on using it for several months to completely understand all the features, then I may try going for a high end Garmin watch as a replacement for my trusty A-watch.  For now, I am (ugh) wearing one watch on each arm.",

        "review": "I've had this watch for almost a month and its been fantastic. GPS and heart rate are accurate, display is sharp (albeit not AMOLED level crisp), and the stats are just what I need/want. The question for you is will this watch meet your needs, wants, and lifestyle?With the release of the Forerunner 165, it *seems* the 55 isn't a great choice. The 165 has an AMOLED display, an altimeter, and a few more bells and whistles for about 40 bucks more. The upgraded screen and altimeter make it seem like an easy choice to set down the extra 40 (or 100 for portable music). However, the 55 still offers a nice value and solid features:I've found the display on this watch to be fine (even with so-so near vision). Its already helped me knock time off my pace and train for an upcoming marathon. The data provided by the 55 is detailed:  the body battery, sleep data, VO2 max, fitness age, stress, running cadence, and more are probably a bit more than I want and encompass all that I need. I always run with my phone (as a Zombie's Run fan and need to be in-touch with the outside world) so having a music option or do-it-all watch isn't necessary.While I haven't pulled a formal training plan (I'm following the Zombie's, Run! marathon trainer which I've used before to good effect), I *could* pull a plan to my 55. Further, the 55 \"knows\" when I've gone hard on a run or had a bad night's sleep and recommends a rest day or lower effort run. All good stuff!TL:DR - the 55 is a great option for a beginner runner or experienced runner who wants some data but knows (or is honest with themselves) that they probably won't dive into too deep (e.g. pace, cadence, body battery, and sleep are all they want with a few more goodies). Its also a great choice for the person who wants a dedicated GPS watch but wears other watches during their day and is having trouble justifying a special purpose purchase.I'm still in the return window for my 55 and I'm going to keep it. The 40 dollar (+ tax) isn't a huge hurdle but I can't say that the 165 gives me enough more to turn in the 55. I'm very happy with this watch because *it meets all my needs an wants* if the same is true for  you, go ahead and order this but if you want the sharper display, a bit more data, and an altimeter (really, the only thing I miss on my 55) then save up some more and go that way.",

        "review": "I got the Garmin Vesu 3s to replace an apple watch to track heart rate after I noticed my apple watch showing out of the norm readings only a year after purchasing. I  never would use a watch for medical advice, but it is nice to be able to note my basic heart rate for my chronic illness. I was advised to try the Garmin because it was built more for athletes and I chose the Vesu 3s because it can do an ECG. I am happy to report that I do like it better than an apple watch! It is slightly larger than the apple watch, which I don't prefer, and the band isn't as nice as the apple watch either, but the watch is more superior in my opinion. I like that the watch face can be customized more than the apple watch and so far it has been pretty spot on with my heart rate (I cross check its data with other methods of tracking heart rate to get a good idea). I am OBSESSED with the fact that it stays charged for so much longer and I can wear it to sleep. Don't love the charging as much. I wish it had a pad it could sit on to charge like an apple watch. It also has a whole host of other health functions to use as well. They give you a USB-C charger and I had to buy a specific converter for it; the chord also isn't long enough and finding a replacement that is longer is something you have to go search for. However, the charging function is simple and fast and works well. Overall, I can't complain about some of functions, I am only relieved that it is completely functional and seems to be living up to its quality so far!",

When I got this watch I was pleasantly surprised by ease of use with respect to swapping through the menus and selecting what you need. Does take some time perhaps to memorize where to go for each item but that is to be expected. I mostly wanted this for the GPS with outdoor activity and the heart rate and fitness features. (Fitbit only ever broke after 3 months, that is to say stopped working out of the blue). The compass is on point and the heart rate monitor is spot on as well. One of the coolest things about this is that it connects to an app and you can look for even better watch faces that have exactly what you want to see on them instead of just the default, that\u2019s the kind of support GARMIN gives with this. I got the watch face that displays heart rate, so I don\u2019t have to swap through menus or use the app to see it in real time. The fit is great and the battery life is as well. You should be aware that some features use up more battery than others, such as active GPS etc, so if you use that you can expect the battery to drain a little bit more quickly. The only adjustment I needed to make was the charging cable, I needed to pinch the lip of the plug with needle nose pliers ever so GENTLY just to adjust them the tiniest amount so it seated properly in the watch which is one of the pictures.

        "review": "I don't write a lot of reviews, but I thought I'd chime in about this. (Just a regular old customer here--no connection to Garmin or Amazon.) My point of view might be uncommon for Garmin owners: I actually don't think of myself as a Smartwatch guy and have actually turned down free Apple Watches (as holiday gifts) on two occasions. No interest in texting on my wrist. I'm a \"watch guy\" in the more traditional sense--a big fan of mid-tier to high-end mechanical watches. But I wanted one techy watch for when I bike and work out and for a long backcountry hike where GPS was going to be necessary. I've owned this watch for a couple months now and have put it through its paces: swimming (it's highly water-resistant), biking, lifting, and (as mentioned) in the wilderness. It hasn't disappointed.Set up is easy and intuitive: if you can handle using an iPhone, you should have no problem making your way through the process. Downloading the smartphone app on your device and syncing it is worth the trouble, in my opinion. Among other things, it will allow you to keep on top of software updates, control your music while working out (without having to touch your phone), and get whatever alerts (like texts or Ring notifications) you might want to opt into. I have it set up so that the Garmin app only seeks out my watch when I open the app---don't want this thing constantly searching and draining my phone battery when I'm not even wearing the watch.I do still fumble through the different buttons trying to remember what does what, but it is getting better. I usually only wear this for a few hours at a time a few days a week; if I wore it more regularly, I'm sure I would be far more fluent by now. And the good news is, you really can't mess anything up by pressing the wrong button.There's tons of customization that you can do (during setup or just whenever) to rearrange the main screen, add or remove activities and options, etc. For an entry-level smartwatch, it's impressively featured!Battery life is utterly insane. I charged it before a 10-hour hike where the GPS was going the entire time--that was in early May. Since then I've worn it several times for many collective hours, sometimes in GPS mode, sometimes not, and I only had to charge it again today--in mid June. Granted, I power it down whenever I'm not using it, but still, you get a lot of time out of a single charge. I have the solar version, and I suppose that extends the battery life in a limited way---can't say I've tested that or noticed strong evidence of it, but I'll take Garmin's word for it.The GPS tracking feature works very well once you get it dialed in to your preferences, which isn't tricky to do. If you get lost, you can flip to the screen where your track is: it's just a squiggly line on the screen---there's no map background on this plain-Jane, smaller, black and white display---but with pretty minimal brainpower, you can use it to retrace your steps, no problem. No chance of getting lost with this thing on, as long as you've got a signal---and I've never had any trouble acquiring one. Beyond that, just having it on your wrist as a trip computer, tracking how long you've been at it, how many miles you've covered, your elevation, etc, is really nice. It allowed me to provide very specific answers every time my kid asked \"how many more miles do we have to go?\" Note, though, that you'll need to activate the GPS mode when you start your hike (or ride or whatever). And you'll want to shut if off when you're done in order to extend the battery life.Nice to have the heart-rate and pulse oximeter features. Also reassuring to have the \"incident reporting\" feature, or whatever it's called. Thankfully haven't had to use it, but I've read positive customer reviews from folks who have. It's a comfort to know that my wife will get an instant alert on her phone if I crash my bike, for example. And I believe the alert will include my exact location.As for the watchy-watch stuff: this thing is very well built. It feels robust, but is as light as a feather. I mean, you can really forget you have it on, especially if you're accustomed to wearing a luxury sports watch that weighs more than 100g. I haven't tried swapping out the rubber strap, but I see no reason why you couldn't put it on a NATO or something if you wanted to. The integrated strap itself feels like it's good quality, though I imagine it will eventually need to be replaced after a few years of putting it on and taking it off.The overall look is very rugged and \"tactical.\" At least with the black model, there's nothing refined or luxurious about it at all.The main thing I want to say about it as a watch per se is that the size is perfect, at least for me. A lot of these smartwatches nowadays are enormous: 45mm and super-thick. To me they look absurd. This one is about 40mm, which is by no means small, but it's sensible and while definitely \"sized\" for a man, could work well as an oversized unisex option. Point is, when I'm wearing it, it just feels like a normal watch, proportioned like several of my other, mechanical watches---not like a giant wrist computer. It calls no attention to itself. The screen isn't tiny or anything: the display is plenty readable. It's not touchscreen, it's not full color, you can't watch videos on it---if you want all of that, look at a different model. This is one of those \"everything you need, nothing you don't\" items. (Though, again, it has a pretty surprising array and number of features---most of which I've never used.)Big fan.",

        "review": "I've been using the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar in Graphite for a while now, and it's been an outstanding experience. This rugged GPS smartwatch has not only met but exceeded my expectations with its solar charging capability, built-in flashlight, and multi-band GNSS support.The solar charging feature is a game-changer. It significantly extends the battery life, ensuring that I rarely have to worry about charging the watch manually. This is incredibly convenient, especially during long hiking trips or outdoor activities where access to power sources is limited. The watch face is designed to maximize exposure to sunlight, efficiently converting it to energy and keeping the watch powered for days on end.Durability is a hallmark of the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar. Its rugged build can withstand all kinds of rough treatment, from bumps and drops to extreme weather conditions. I've used it in heavy rain, on dusty trails, and under the scorching sun, and it has performed flawlessly in every scenario. The graphite color not only looks sleek but also masks dirt and wear, keeping the watch looking new.The built-in flashlight has proven to be more useful than I initially thought. It's powerful enough to guide me through dark paths during night treks and convenient when I need to find something in my backpack after dusk. This feature adds an extra layer of utility, making the watch an indispensable tool for any adventure.As for navigation, the multi-band GNSS support ensures accurate location tracking in even the most challenging environments. Whether I'm in a deep valley, near tall buildings, or under thick canopy, the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar maintains a precise signal, giving me confidence in my location and route.The user interface is intuitive, and syncing with my smartphone is seamless, providing me with notifications, weather updates, and other essential information. The range of activity tracking features is impressive, from standard fitness metrics to specialized outdoor activities, all accurately monitored and recorded.The Garmin Instinct 2X Solar is a top-tier smartwatch that stands out for its solar charging, durability, and precise navigation. It's the perfect companion for anyone who loves the outdoors or needs a reliable timepiece that can handle the rigors of adventure. I highly recommend it to those seeking a rugged, feature-rich smartwatch that won\u2019t let you down.",

        "review": "This is the perfect activity watch/smartwatch for me. It can\u2019t call or text from the watch itself, but those are features I rarely used on my Apple Watch anyway. It\u2019ll still show you if you have a text, call, or any other notification but is geared toward being more of a great activity watch than a phone on your wrist.What\u2019s great about this is how jam-packed with features it is. They took a ton of stuff that previously was only available in the fenix and epix watches and brought it to this instinct 2x solar. It has sleep tracking, activity tracking (with customizable screens for each activity), training readiness, heart rate, vo2 max, blood oxygen level, etc.  Most apps charge money for the amount of detail this watch and app give you about your day to day and activities, but there\u2019s no subscription on this. It\u2019s all freeAnd it constantly checks heart rate. My old Apple Watch would check periodically but you could never glance down and see what the current hr was without tapping on the icon and waiting. With this watch it constantly is reading heart rate and keeps a graph showing the history (which you can have show on the watch face if you want).The battery is awesome, something like 40 days with how I have mine set up. And the solar charging actually works. I\u2019ve heard that past versions it didn\u2019t help all too much, but this one it really makes a difference. I added 2 days to my battery life from just a few hours in direct sunlight.The only places where this watch is lesser are the display and the navigation. If detailed maps and touch screen/oled screen are important to you, then go with the fenix or epix models. The navigation on this watch can be useful as it includes the trackback feature where it\u2019ll guide you back on the path you came in on, line-of-sight tracking (keeps you on path if you have to go like down in a valley or around an obstacle where you might lose sense of direction), and you can even pre-load courses to follow later. However, it\u2019s a pretty bare-bones navigation map. It has a pointer for your watch and a line showing the path and that\u2019s about it. The epix and fenix watches have nicer displays, color, touchscreen, and more detailed maps which help a lot with navigation but you also sacrifice a significant amount of battery life for those features. And they\u2019re double the price of this one.All in all, I think this is the perfect middle point for a watch. It has all the features from the top of the line ones that I need, along with crazy battery life and a decent price. If you don\u2019t need detailed navigation but want great gps and activity tracking at half the cost of some of those other watches, this is a great option.",

        "review": "I got it 100 days ago and have only charged it 5 times. I've used the GPS and activity tracking for about 125 hours, and ran over 135 miles, including 2 spartan races. The band is very durable and lets me tighten it as much as needed to keep most mud out, though the mud during one race did prevent it from tracking my HR properly for about 10 minutes. The watch itself is also durable, and it's activity tracking is as accurate most other Garmin trackers I've used. The GPS is fairly accurate though it does leave the trail by about 3 meters in the foliage (though you can make it more accurate if you want). The solar panel works very well and the battery lasts far longer than I need. The first charge lasted 32 days (charging at 10-20% battery). In total, in 100 days, I've worn it for all but 10 or so hours (while charging it). The torch is very nice too, though I use it very sparingly as it can rapidly drain the battery. I've found no fault with the watch so far in any activity including swimming, running, biking, HR broadcasting, or cardio (though some activities don't track properly on instinct series watches such as jumping rope). All in all, it's a great buy.",

I always wanted the 51mm size in AMOLED, and now the Epix offers that.  The battery life is simply amazing and in smart watch mode, I get longer life than my 7X. The screen is AMAZING much like an Apple Watch or Samsung watch.  This is NOT a smart watch in the sense of Apple or Samsung. This is a fitness/outdoor watch. You're not going to make phone calls, watch videos etc on this watch. This is geared for folks who value health metrics. Overall, I'd say this watch is the best Garmin has to offer.  The new HR appears better than the older generation. It's able to lock on and read HR during strength training workouts. The older models struggled in that area like most wrist based HRM. Steady state cardio workouts, the HRM is spot on! It's an expensive watch, but worth every penny in my opinion. The maps are absolutely detailed and MUCH easier to read when compared to a MIP display offered in the Fenix series.",

The flashlight.  The weather.  Sleep patterns.  Heart rate.  Step counting.  GPS.  Compass.  Plus much more.  Admittedly there's a learning curve to using all the features but once you get the hang of it,there's a logic to accessing and editing features.The battery life on the 51 is phenomenal.  I have a Casio ProTrek and that requires a daily charge .  The Garmin will go for almost 2 weeks between charges, depending on the features you actively use.Obviously it's a handsome watch and so far the titanium watch and sapphire glass has held up with no scratches.  I like being able to customize the watch faces too to reflect different data fields or just more appealing face/colors.I highly recommend the watch if you're comfortable spending such a large amount.It's also the most comfortable watch I've ever worn.",

With the new AMOLED display in the Epic thought maybe this would be the time.The clincher for me was moving to a job where I could wear the watch all day, plus the recent price drop for the holidays.I opted for the Epix Pro Sapphire 51mm due to the larger batter and extended life.  I have a large enough wrist that the smaller watches seem too dainty, anyway.The watch features are amazing.  The addition of blood oxygen monitoring alone has been worth the price of admission.  I am able to get much better insight into my sleep quality and struggles with obstructive sleep apnea.The EEG is also an amazing capability to have on your wrist.I\u2019ve noticed the processor response times are faster than my older 5X.I\u2019ve yet to use some of the features like onboard music and Garmin pay.Just an amazing and gorgeous watch.",

Huge battery, built in flashlight (that I use pretty regularly), tons of info and even apps at your fingertips.Two things it does NOT have: 1. microphone / speaker: you cannot make or receive phone calls, and it cannot make any sound. This is due to the fact that it is really waterproof down to 50 meters or something like that, so it can't have any open ports like a speaker or mic.2. it will NOT measure your VO2max, unless you run at 70% of your max heart rate for 10 minutes. I'm too big and old to run like that, so it doesn't measure my VO2max. A bit of a disappointment since my earlier fitbit would do that.I really do love it and plan to keep it, but also it is a bit of \"power tool\" for fitness enthusiasts and doesn't do a couple of the more common smartwatch features that you might expect.",

I have personalized the face and can switch easily between the personalized and standard faces. Battery life is amazing and quick to recharge when needed. The band was ok but didn't fit my wrist as i wanted so got these (B0DF2L935T) set of 3 stretch bands. they fit perfectly and are adjustable. dry quickly if they get wet (shower). Face is very easy to read in all light. you can set quiet hours and the watchface does not automatically come on if you move in your sleep. can still quickly access the face with the bottom button. Highly recommend",

I am a distance runner, and honestly this watch has been my best investment so far. The battery life is so long, allowing me to go days without charging it, and when I do need to charge it, it charges very quickly. It\u2019s very easy to use and has a lot of helpful functions. I love being able to customize my watch face as well to match what I\u2019m wearing. Matched with the garmin app, this watch is perfect for anyone who wants to have a watch with both functionality and good design.

I've tested the heart rate against other machines a dozen times, it's never more than a couple beats difference. The GPS is good enough, occasionally vulnerable to super heavy weather. That said, it succeeded in tracking most of my movement skiing in a blizzard, so not bad!But here's the thing: two years old, the battery life is down to 6 days with no exercise. Every hour of activity tracking takes away a full day of battery life. I thought I could do a weekend on Manhattan without my charger, but it tracked every walk around town, and the battery died in 1.5 days.  (BTW it spontaneously tracked 6 of my 11 miles walking around town)Music function with Bluetooth is pretty good, sometimes broken. Between my left wrist and right ear, that's disappointing. But usually good enough to keep my rhythm on a 3-mile jog.I haven't found a better watch for these functions, but perfection would be great.",

        "review": "What you have on your wrist is a phenomenal computer with 100's of thousands of man hours in the writing of code and algorithms to take all the data from the sensors and turn it into a comprehensive health guide for physical fitness.  And Garmin, along wth Polar and Apple and Suunto and all the other lesser known brands, have barely scratched the surface of the possibilities to harness computing power on your wrist.  They haven't even begun to tie in AI to take the data and give you your own personal narrative for how to optimize your health and fitness.  One could write a book on all the potential for this technology in this field.But as to the implementation...The menus need some work...Garmin Connect, where one can build an app and upload it to the watch to run weight lifting routines or HIIT exercises needs a very lot of work.  It works but it's crude and basic.  For instance, if you want to track HRR [Heart Rate Recovery] after an excercise you have to remember to hit stop immediately, hit the lower right button to gain access to a set of options and then scroll to track HRR over the next two minutes.  All the while you are losing heart beats to count.  Really?  Why isn't that option in the GC app maker so you can add it to the app you are building?  And why, when you do a repetitive set that has work-rest and you repeat that x number of times do they insist on ending with a rest period.  The last period should be a work period.  And why can't the tie their lame audio beeps to your phone where you can customize the sounds you want to hear when doing a HIIT routine, eg?But, for all my grousing, I love being able to track my sleep and quality of sleep, my HR, HRV, time to recover, quality of the workout, time in HR Zones, Anaerobic and Aerobic quality, Body Battery, Stress, Intensity minutes, Training Status, Training Readiness, etc.  Too many things to mention.  And I've just scratched the surface in learning how to use it over these last 5 months.  I'm really excited about how they will integrate AI into this journey.  I would love to have an AI bundled with the watch that I could talk to through my phone.  Or have the Garmin Forerunner 256 be able to talk to me through Bluetooth to ear buds.",

The stats are better, the screen is easier to read than the transflective one of the 235, and it's just as reliable. The workout options are more varied and customizable. It looks great, and I like the strap better than the 235.The heart rate and pulse ox tracking seem very accurate, when comparing to trustworthy dedicated devices.The sleep tracking has been very helpful as well. I don't believe any fitness watch is great at delineating when you're in REM versus deep sleep, etc. But it's a very useful overview.

        "review": "Great bike computer that has some awesome capabilities and features. I mainly mountain bike so those are the features I use often. The jump tracking is surprisingly very good and neat to see your stats and attempt to beat them. This is the same with the flow and grit statistics that offer a cool analysis to compete with. It shows nearby routes for mountain biking trails which is awesome especially if going to a new trail you can try a route to stay on course and not get lost. GPS is superb for tracking even in the woods. With that, battery was not affected too much, ~45 min ride in the woods in 26 degree weather with GPS + GLONASS enabled (most battery consumption) lost 4% battery. The Garmin connect app is very good, I've had zero issues and really like what it has to offer and the user interface along with viewing my activities. It is on par with strava and almost makes me want to buy a garmin smartwatch honestly. Having no touchscreen may be a plus for me actually, I use gloves often so a touchscreen would be painful. Also, the buttons work well and are easy to get use to after playing around with the device here and there. I have more features to try out but so far this is a awesome bike computer and I have no things that bother me about it at all so far.I've seen reviews saying it's too complicated and took long to setup. The app walks you through setup that takes 5 minutes and if you want to customize all your screens/profiles that display while riding that will take a bit longer but that is not setup. This is a electronic device that offers some great features and yes using some of these features requires technical prowess. But what electronic device doesn't, phones, tablets, laptops, computers etc do. There will be a learning curve as there is with many things in life. For me I am highly technologically skilled in consumer and some business electronics(IT professional) this device is relatively easy to use for me. For others it may be similar to buying a phone from another manufacturer or a new model with a new operating system. The point is it will take a bit of time to get use to like most things. If it's too complicated I suggest another bike computer that has much less features such as it only tracks speed/distance/time/clock. But if you want to up your cycling skills this will help with its advanced data and analysis along with some features to smile about.",

        "review": "I have had and enjoyed using an Edge 520 for a number of years. But the battery has lost significant capacity and I decided it was time for a new one. And I decided I should get something with a few more bells and whistles, specifically navigation wise. So I opted for this.The layout is standard Garmin: on-off and scroll buttons on the left, enter and back buttons on the right, and start-stop and lap buttons on the bottom. No touch screen on this, but I didn\u2019t want a touchscreen.I haven\u2019t yet familiarized myself with all the screens available but I imagine there\u2019s a screen for just about any purpose.I found it pretty easy to pair up with my phone, and also to pair up with my hr and cadence sensors. I have 2 bikes with 2 different cadence sensors and so far it seems to switch seamlessly between the two. My old Edge sometimes wouldn\u2019t switch for reasons I never quite managed to figure out.The display visibility can be tricky. I have found it to be somewhat sensitive to the angle you have it mounted at. For me, having the display face flat instead of slanted a bit back is better. Time of day and season is a factor too. Late afternoon in winter, when the sun is low, can cause difficulties. I might add at this point, that my eyesight is not the best, someone with good vision might have fewer problems. But now that I have the display angle worked out, I can see it pretty well when in the saddle. Having the backlight turned on helps.Battery life is pretty good. I average about an hour to 90 minutes a day, 7 days a week and I can go well over a week before I need to recharge.",

        "review": "Okay - well it was a secret to me at least. I'll get to that button in a moment after a quick user review of this device.As a pilot who has used a few different models of Garmin in the cockpit (430, 530, G1000), I was curious how this unit stacked up against the other options out there. After all, the Wahoo Element ROAM and Hammerhead Karoo were developed by cycling experts, while the Garmin was developed by GPS experts. The latter was great with the technology, but covered many different modes of transportation. I imagined that Wahoo or Hammerhead would \"understand\" the needs of the cyclist better. But ultimately, it was my experience with Garmin and the reviews of others that made me pick the Edge 530. So to be fair, I cannot compare it with the offerings from Wahoo or Hammerhead, and can only speak for this unit.There is a lot to this small screen that I am still learning, but it is Information Central on my rides. The 530 lacks the touch screen of the 830, but riding on bumpy gravel paths, the touchscreen would not only be of limited use beyond configuring things at the breakfast table before a ride, but in fact could prove a nuisance if accidently touched during a ride.And now - THAT HIDDEN BUTTON! If you read nothing else about the 530 - read this....The buttons on each side are easy enough to get used to. There is one big button however that many people apparently miss (I picture it with this review). It's perhaps the most important one of all, because without pressing it, everything on the 530 remains simply a plan and NOT an active route. It is at the bottom of the screen next to the USB port. I was wondering why my rides never started recording. The GPS directions were working, but the ride clock remained at zero. It turns out that this \"play\" button at the bottom of the screen - which is essentially hidden visually and less tactile than the more obvious side buttons - is key to the unit's operation. I was so confused as to why my rides never started that I called Garmin tech support and the guy on the phone laughed and said he had the same problem when he first got the unit (before he worked for Garmin) and it took him a few rides to figure it out. So if this review is any help at all - look at ALL the buttons on the unit - not just the ones on the side!That of course brings up one more piece of this review. Tech support was responsive, effective and engaging. In all, the Garmin Edge 530 is highly recommended by this cyclist.",

The functionality and battery life are fantastic and are a real help to me when planning my activities. I like that the watch turns on when you raise it toward your gaze, works well, and that at night the screen is dimmed and simplified. My only longer term question is with the charging connection, this has not evolved from prior generations, and I have found this to be the weak part of the design - sometimes the connections get dirty or the cable breaks and charging can be a pain - wireless charging would be an improvement.",

Courses work pretty well once you select the correct course ;)  Climb pro is great enabling me to happily huff and puff my way up the hills.It Syncs immediately with my HR monitor, ROTOR 2InPower power meter, Shimano 8150 groupset, and speed sensor working flawlessly, every time.Overall happy, but IMO, Garmin SW usability could be improved further.

        "review": "What you have on your wrist is a phenomenal computer with 100's of thousands of man hours in the writing of code and algorithms to take all the data from the sensors and turn it into a comprehensive health guide for physical fitness.  And Garmin, along wth Polar and Apple and Suunto and all the other lesser known brands, have barely scratched the surface of the possibilities to harness computing power on your wrist.  They haven't even begun to tie in AI to take the data and give you your own personal narrative for how to optimize your health and fitness.  One could write a book on all the potential for this technology in this field.But as to the implementation...The menus need some work...Garmin Connect, where one can build an app and upload it to the watch to run weight lifting routines or HIIT exercises needs a very lot of work.  It works but it's crude and basic.  For instance, if you want to track HRR [Heart Rate Recovery] after an excercise you have to remember to hit stop immediately, hit the lower right button to gain access to a set of options and then scroll to track HRR over the next two minutes.  All the while you are losing heart beats to count.  Really?  Why isn't that option in the GC app maker so you can add it to the app you are building?  And why, when you do a repetitive set that has work-rest and you repeat that x number of times do they insist on ending with a rest period.  The last period should be a work period.  And why can't the tie their lame audio beeps to your phone where you can customize the sounds you want to hear when doing a HIIT routine, eg?But, for all my grousing, I love being able to track my sleep and quality of sleep, my HR, HRV, time to recover, quality of the workout, time in HR Zones, Anaerobic and Aerobic quality, Body Battery, Stress, Intensity minutes, Training Status, Training Readiness, etc.  Too many things to mention.  And I've just scratched the surface in learning how to use it over these last 5 months.  I'm really excited about how they will integrate AI into this journey.  I would love to have an AI bundled with the watch that I could talk to through my phone.  Or have the Garmin Forerunner 256 be able to talk to me through Bluetooth to ear buds.",

        "review": "I\u2019ve been using this watch daily for 3 months now and have lots to say about it! This was my first Garmin/fitness watch, although I\u2019ve been wearing an Apple Watch for many years. So this review is primarily a comparison of Apple Watch vs Garmin.First of all, the pros:*this thing is so powerful! The first time I did a run with it, the data blew me away. I\u2019m currently obsessed with watch my VO2 max climb and seeing my HR and run power after every workout.*the Garmin Coach is SO COOL. I used one of the integrated plans to train for a 10k (I was already a competent runner and not slow) and managed to shave 30s off my pace. Knocked out a PR I was super proud of, with just a couple weeks of following a plan.*I love the training readiness score. I\u2019m slowly learning that I generally like to push myself harder than I should and this thing keeps me from injury and over exertion. I\u2019m often surprised at how slow it tells me to go on Z2 runs, and yet I keep getting faster.*I love this thing when following a plan or doing a race! It regularly tells me (via AirPods) when I\u2019m going too fast or too slow. It helps me stay solidly in my training zone. Then, during a race, you can tell it what finish time you want to hit and it will keep you on track the whole time! I don\u2019t think I would\u2019ve hit my PR without that. Just a quick glance at my watch and I immediately knew how many seconds I was ahead or behind my plan.*i love the touch screen but will say that the majority of the time I\u2019m using the buttons to navigate. Took me a minute to figure out what they all did.*the battery life!!! Coming from Apple Watch, I was floored that this thing lasts for literally over a week on one charge. Come on Apple, get it together with the battery life!A few cons:*this watch is not small. I actually kinda like the large size but as a woman on the smaller side of average, it\u2019s pretty bulky. Which leads me to..*I never sleep with it (it\u2019s too big to be comfortable) which means that my training readiness/body battery isn\u2019t as accurate as it could be. I did try sleeping with it the first week but it did a terrible job of tracking my sleep. Seemed to only notice when I was sleeping from 6am on\u2026??*the Garmin is definitely not a smart watch. Sure, it tells you when someone is calling or has texted but there\u2019s no communication from the watch to the phone (no answering calls, responding to texts). I found myself constantly irritated that I couldn\u2019t send a quick reaction to a text from my watch like usual. (I now only wear my garmin for workouts and put my Apple Watch back on for the rest of the day)*BEWARE the dreaded blue triangle. About a month after having this, a blue triangle showed up on screen and I couldn\u2019t get it to turn off/on or go away. After some googling, I realized it\u2019s a common software glitch. There is a way to reboot it, but I had to do it three times in just a few days and that was annoying. So far so good though, it hasn\u2019t happened in a long time.Overall, I\u2019m thoroughly pleased with this purchase and feel like a legit athlete. I bought it mainly for its triathlon capabilities but haven\u2019t trained for another tri yet. Unfortunately, the integrated Garmin coach only has running and cycling plans, but I did read that you can get a triathlon plan directly from the Garmin website (just haven\u2019t tried it yet).",

        "review": "I currently own a Garmin 57 dash cam and have been very happy with it and it goes between my personal and work vehicles. When Garmin released a 4K camera, I jumped at it. Now I have the 57 installed permanently in the work vehicle and the X310 in my personal vehicle.  Garmin has the best phone app out there and it works flawlessly between the cameras. The X310 works just like the 57-menu system and supposedly it has even sharper video, although the video looks pretty much the same as the 57. I attribute this to the fact that I don't have a 4k monitor to view it on, just a regular 1080p monitor, so I'm not seeing any sharpness upgrade on my monitor. Aside from this the video is still great, colors, sharpness and all. I do like the added touchscreen making it much easier to navigate the menu, not that the button system of the 57 was hard. The x310 is a smaller footprint in thickness than the 57, the width and height, close to the same.  I will admit it is a bit spendy, but it's totally worth it for the quality, the Garmin name behind it, and phone app. It's super small and fits right behind my rearview mirror so it's never a distraction. The voice commands are great, and they always work flawlessly. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase.Nov 17, 2024 update.  I recently caught an accident of a guy racing up beside me and then smashing head first into a car that was in the center turn lane.  I wished I had a rear camera to see when the guy pulled out and raced up the center lane.  So, I bought the Garmin Mini 3 to put in my back window. Was super simple, plugged adapter into to back 12v cigarette lighter port right by the back hatch, ran wire just up the side door seal and spiraled the wire(you wrap it around a dowel, heat the wire with a heat gun/hairdryer, let cool, take off and turn the wire wrap the opposite direction...you now a coiled wire) to allow the hatch to open an close without having wire hanging.  Stuck to corner of back window, and connected to the Garmin app.  Now they both work in unison and connect flawlessly every time via Wi-Fi.  A caveat, if you ever need to download a video, you can do it with the Wi-Fi, it can be done, but it's a bit slow and cumbersome, ideally, taking out the card and putting in a computer is much better.  If you have a mini usb phone, like the iPhone 14 or newer you can plug your phone right into the usb on the new Garmins and it\u2019s super-fast, just like a computer.  Now I have front and back videos.  I'm very happy with the 4K video out the front and the 1080p out the back.  Both videos are clear and sharp, very happy with the Garmin Mini 3.",

        "review": "I purchased this from Amazon a few days ago as well as the Constant Power Cable.So far, I'm loving it.I subscribed and connected it to LTE service through Garmin for $10 a month for 7 days of saved video.  It's then connected to the OBDII port using the Constant Power Cable.  Over three nights of testing, I've been able to remotely connect to the dash cam to view the live feed perfectly.  At work, it successfully sent me a notification of an event and uploaded the event video to the cloud a minute later.This leads to the one downside.  This dash cam does not have a rear camera which is really lame.  Nothing occurred in the front view video so I assume that, being in a parking garage, the vibrations of a passing car set it off.  If so, it's annoying that I didn't have a rear camera to see the event but I am happy with the fact that the camera is sensitive enough to pick that up.However, you can purchase one of their Mini cams for about $130 and route it into the Constant Power Cable as it has two USB ports on it.  You will not get live parking mode alerts with that camera unless your vehicle is within range of your WiFi network.  If you live in an apartment and park 50-80 yards from your building like me and want live parking mode alerts with your rear camera, you'll need a 2nd Dash Cam Live and a 2nd $10 a month subscription.  I'll be doing one or the other but most likely just purchasing a 2nd Live cam to get the full power of the system.  With competitors LTE cameras you're paying $600+ so you're really only paying maybe $100-200 more or even less considering how you power the device.I was set on getting a BlackVue LTE camera but the reviews of the app have been really bad - like unusable in some cases so I opted for the rock solid interface of the Garmin.  The BlackVue ones start at $470, with a $11 a month LTE subscription but if you want the parking mode, you need to hardwire it to the battery (which I'd never want to do) or get one of their battery packs which are $160-$390.The power of this camera is that you have LTE service with parking mode alerts and video upload.  If somebody were to try stealing your wheels in the middle of the night, you get an alert.  If somebody breaks your window and steals stuff in your car, you'll get an alert as well as a video uploaded to the cloud in the case that they remove your SD card or steal the camera altogether.  If somebody steals your car, and doesn't remove the camera, you have GPS tracking.  If you need to check anything, you can turn on the Live View etc.Setup and installation was a breeze - took an hour including routing the cable through the rubber gaskets around the door and floor.There isn't much more to say right now other than a few things I learned through my chat with support and reading manuals:1 - The Garmin knows to enter parking mode through the OBDII port diagnostics.2 - When using parking mode, KEEP THE APP OPEN but in the background!  Otherwise it doesn't send notifications.3 - When in parking mode, it isn't constantly recording and draining power.  If an event occurs (a vibrational incident), then the camera starts filming and records/uploads the event.4 - The Constant Power Cable can be switched between operating for 10m, 24 hours or infinitely.  I do really wish it had a 12 hour setting here to cover the night time/sleeping only.  It's silly that there isn't a 12 hour option or one between 10m and 24 hours.5 - The Constant Power Cable has battery voltage protection so it won't drain your battery to nothing.  It will shut off after 10 minutes if it detects the battery is under 12v.",

I hit roughly 200 chip shots and the R10 picks up on every slight mistake I do so I find it very accurate. Woods can be shorter than on the course but I would attribute that to the firm ground and roll outside. The biggest issue is having shots that don't pick up. Short chips (<10 yards) are virtually impossible, and drivers often don't register due to their lack of height. The R10 goes into standby mode often and I occasionally having to press the button on the back to reset it. I would suggest buying an alignment/leveling stand because if the R10 isn't facing the ball at the correct angle then misreads can happen. The camera almost never works for me. Software/app is mediocre, but the R10 integrates with several other programs nicely (TGC, E6, GSPro). The nuances are absolutely worth the price difference between other monitors on the market, if you're just looking for something to give you good numbers and run other software. I considered trading up to a Mevo+ but the readings were the same for both monitors and the Mevo+ putting was so bad that it wasn't worth it.",

        "review": "You have to like the price of this device and it is good Garmin is finally getting them back in stock.Now that I have used the product outdoors at the range I am updating my review and have added another star.  The R10 works very well as long as you take the time to set it up properly which is true of all launch monitors.  I did not have any other monitors to check the results but had a friend use a range finder to check distances and they were very close.  I did not pay for the subscription yet but I believe it could be used to simulate play at a course in Home Tee Hero with good results.I also want COMMEND the product support team they have worked with to attempt to resolve the issues I have had using the monitor indoors.  Using the Garmin Approach R10 indoors returns data well under what I should be seeing, by at least 20%.  I am an older golfer and the one time I had access to a TrackMan it clocked my swing speed between 65 & 70mph so maybe the algorithms used in R10  penalize slower swings compared to others.  If so, I can hope a firmware or app update fixes addresses this.  Another shortcoming I have found is how many missed shots there are when the clubs speeds drop below 30mph.  I think that it tries to allow for a pre-swing waggle and as a result ignores short, slow chip like swings.  Even below 40mph some the data that is calculated can be missing but it usually captures most shots above 30mph.  This could really impact the ability to use this device in an indoor simulation as chipping would be much more difficult.  The R10 has no way to capture putting so in the simulation it assigns a number of putting strokes based on distance from the pin, I knew this ahead of my purchase and have no issue with it. (I forgot to check this on the range so not sure if it is an indoor only thing or something I am doing wrong, the YouTubers don't seem to have this issue)  If I get that fixed it will be 5 stars for sure.On the plus side other than distance and carry being short, the data the R10 spits out is consistent and appears to be correct based on what I am seeing while using it.  Shots that go to the right of my target are reported as that direction, same for pulled shots that go to the left.  On the driving range app it is a little difficult to tell if there is a draw or a slice, just that it was offline and by how much.  Since it is radar-based lighting has no effect, so using it in a dimly lit garage should not be a problem or affect the data since technically you should be able to use it in the dark.In the end I am glad that I bought it and will continue to use it during practice.  At this price point I doubt there is a better product for the mid to high handicapper looking for feedback on how they struck the ball.  If you buy one make sure you update the firmware as that can make a huge difference depending on when the device was built.And once again product support has been excellent and continues to be quite responsive.",

        "review": "After 11 months using this product inside and outside, comparing data side by side to Trackman at Club Champion, this product is more than worth its price and is nearly identical to trackman #\u2019s. When using the simulator indoors, I highly encourage the Titleist RCT golf balls as it accurately tracks spin due to the reflective layer underneath the balls cover. If you don\u2019t have these balls, it\u2019s an algorithm to estimate spin which can be misleading to true spin numbers. If you\u2019re trying to fit yourself for a new driver, you need those golf balls. Without these balls, my spin was estimated to be around 4,000 RPM which i know is inaccurate. Once i put the balls in play, my spin dropped to my expected 1900-2200 number at 114 mph club head speed.I\u2019m using the r10 with the E6 simulator software and it\u2019s fantastic. The interface is already built in the garmin app, you just need a computer that can run the software. I\u2019ve used awesome golf and it wasn\u2019t realistic enough for me. E6 is LIDAR based and has a yearly subscription that is reasonable. I\u2019m using a gaming computer and have no issues. Again, the RCT balls accurately track spin, even on chips via the E6 software. It wasn\u2019t tracking this on chips (showed 0rpm spin) until I put these balls in place.My yardages are spot on to my exact carry numbers. I don't ever focus on total distance as that is always misleading for any simulator. I found that optimal indoor lightning is absolutely necessary for the simulator to capture each swing. You need ample room (about 8 feet) for the garmin to be able to capture the RCT ball spin #. The best thing about the garmin unit is ability to modify elevation, humidity, and temperature within the garmin app (if using E6 software you can only modify elevation). This is HUGE! Golfers underestimate all three of these factors when playing golf.There are a lot of weekend hacks on youtube that can't use launch monitors to their fullest capacity, and I can genuinely say this is a great unit.I feel you can benefit from this unit and would highly recommend if you\u2019re a data golfer like myself.",

He's had brand loyalty to Lowrance since the beginning of fish finders. He's had his HDS for several years and never did get the hang of using it to its full advantage. He bought a fishing boat last fall and gave the family cuddy cabin to our son for his family. Only problem was our son couldn't afford a sonar unit for it and didnt feel comfortable taking it out without one. So, being the type of parents/grandparents we are, we passed the Lowrance on and started the search for one Hubby could actually use and benefit from. While he continued to look at Lowrance, I walked over to the Garmin display. Wow! What a difference a brand makes! The salesman kept comparing the Lowrance Hubby was considering to the Garmin, and now I knew why. So, I suggested Hubby take a look at the Garmin. He was so impressed by the graphics and comparative ease of use,  he was sold. Now that he's had time to play with it and use it at least once on Lake Erie, I am happy to report I have a happy spouse. And of course, happy spouse, happy house! Since I haven't actually used it, I don't feel comfortable giving it 5 stars. But I can recommend it.",

        "review": "I had the fenix 3 and loved it, but the screen was impossible to read most of the time.  This was a major problem for me and probably most users.  I then switched to a apple watch.  I really liked the easy of use, but felt that the tracking of activities was not that detailed and the battery life completely sucked.  I purched my second apple watch and had it just over a  year and went swimming with it.  It asked to track and open water swim and I said yes.  It then died from getting wet.  At that point, I was done with apple and was looking for something that was more dependable and had a long battery life.  Every did a ton of research and found that most of watches work well, but almost none have all the features I was looking for (long battery life, looks good, bright display, customized watch face, detailed tracking of activities, durable, water proof and compatible with IOS.  There were few that did all of these and found that I really liked the look of the fenix 8 AMOLED.  I have had it about 3 weeks and love it.  There is a little bit of a learning curve with the menu and trying to find were some of the things are.  Also depending on the activities, depends on what you need to do.  Like with lifting, it will track weight, reps and set you do.  Which is really nice.  Also, with some of the activities it will track your actual movement on a map.  I did softball and did not hit that well, so it showed most of my movement from home to first.  Golf is also nice, because you can track your score, Get distance to pin, a map of the hole/hazards and if you get the subscription you can play virtual rounds.  I also found that the garmin gps was more accurate then the course gps.  Battery life is so nice and the watch looks great too.  With the always on feature and tracking everything, I get around 11-15 days between each charge.  IWatch I would have to charge mid day to handle a full day of activities.  With the Garmin, it will also track my sleep/rest whic is something that I did not get because of battery life with the IWatch.  Again, if you never had a Garmin, you will need to learn the menu system and how it tracks, but they have done a great job with this one.  Over all extremely happy with it and would recommend it to others.  My only complaint is the price, but looking at the other watches out there with similar technology, this one is about 2-3 hundred more, but looks way better, is more rugged and way better support and community.",

It consistently says my resting heart rate is in the 90s.  Occasionally it would show 70s which is a significant difference.  My OH1 strap usually has me in the 60s2.  Sleep score and stage measurements are off.  My typical sleep pattern almost always has me waking up in the middle of the night and up for about an hour before I fall back asleep again.  The \u201cawake\u201d measure was NEVER accurate.  For example:  I was up last night for ~40 min and it shows I was awake for 17 min. This makes me question whether or not it\u2019s accurately measuring the other stages.Otherwise, the watch is beautiful and was a tough thing to give up.

Even though it was more than three times more expensive, I wanted it to provide the information to my Garmin App.  To my surprise a solid performer it wasn't.  It is difficult to setup, doesn't update well with the Garmin app and within a couple of weeks the weight scale programming and electronic broke down to where the screen just flashed white then black until it shut off.  To Garmin's credit they replaced the unit and I started over again.  This new unit works, but the screen doesn't stay on long enough and is so small you can't read it. The app displays the measured weight but is hard to find BMI, water, muscle bone and fat % but does not provide a BMR, really minimal information and display on the Garmin app.  I have tried two different competitor smart weight scales that have wonderful apps that integrate with the scale flawlessly and provide a myriad of information, analysis and help.  Both of the top rated weight scales were very easy to setup and their smart phone app were both very easy to use providing all of the measured information gathered from the scale including weight, BMI, bone, muscle, water, fat, lean body mass, subcutaneous fat and total fat. They both also provide your BMR. Your resting metabolic rate. Which is very important if you are trying to achieve your weight goals.  They both provide trends and analysis. The Garmin app does not provide BMR nor any analysis.  Garmin could really make this a bright differentiator but they haven't and even thought I have the S2, I purchased a new top rated smart weight scale, for a fraction of the Garmin S2 price and the new competitor smart scale works flawlessly",

So far the positives on the Vivosmart 5 (cost comparable) are the all-in-one protective band, sleek design (a little bit narrower than the Fitbit 5). The functions are impressive, accurate and limitless but not simple to use. Initial set-up is a breeze, step by step on the band and app but there are no instructions after that so plan on spending some time getting to know your Vivosmart 5, don\u2019t get frustrated it may take 4 or 5 days but once you figure it out your going to love it, I do. Some functions will not appear for a couple of days as data must be gathered to generate results. Biggest draw back is no found logging. They work in conjunction with My Fitness Pal, which wants you to pay premium to use almost any of their features, yuck and the syncing between the two is not great, so there is never a accurate breakdown of calories in/out without bouncing back and forth between the apps. Fitbit 5 wins over Vivosmart 5 for food logging. Very happy with the purchase and excited to put my Vivosmart 5 to the test!",

If you are pushing a a mower or a cart, it will not record your steps.  If you are carrying something, like lumber or building materials, no step tracking.  In the last two days of yard work my old Fitbit would have recorded over 20,000 steps.  The Garmin recorded 6500.  The Garmin uses GPS so it should be tracking this movement but support just says it does not do this tracking.In the evening I have been woken by a very bright red light from the watch.  This is from the bottom of the watch against the skin.  It will flash this bright light 2 or 3 times at irregular intervals.  If I move my wrist, it will go off for a while.  So I guess I need to stay up to move all night to move the watch.  There is nothing in support or help to indicate what this function is or how to change it.I will be returning the watch and already have my old Fitbit back on.  I cannot recommend this watch!",

Battery life is a week or more unless you have features like full time pulse ox or other power hungry features turned on.The main issue with it is that the sleep tracking is more limited and less reliable than the next model up (vivoactive 5) and there are currently some problems with the \u201cbody battery\u201d feature unless they can fix the firmware.In particular, it doesn\u2019t do \u201cnap tracking\u201d but then again the nap tracking even on more expensive models is currently rather inaccurate with things like sitting in a recliner reading while awake being detected as a \u201cnap\u201d.Basically this is the model you want if you just need the essential features of a fitness/health tracker, don\u2019t want to be paying for subscriptions, and don\u2019t need stuff like ConnectIQ apps (most of which aren\u2019t that useful). It does almost all of the \u201cbuilt in\u201d stuff the more expensive watches have \u201cbuilt in\u201d to the firmware.And the iPhone app is good quality and actually works, syncs reliably, etc, even with Apple not being helpful since they want you to buy their bloated extremely short battery life watches.",

        "review": "After about 6 rides of more than 20+ miles each, I feel comfortable writing a review about the Garmin Varia RTL515. First, let me say that this Radar with Taillight works exactly as advertised and I can easily recommend it to any bike rider. That said, here are what I hope may be some helpful notes:- I use the radar with my iPhone 14 Pro and the associated Varia app- It took me less than 10 minutes to unpackage, mount, install the app and pair to my phone (note that for my rides my iPhone is attached to a mount on the handlebars)- Some have reported issues with the mounting hardware that comes with the device. I encountered no issues at all (installing or while riding)- Be sure to use the audible sounds and not just the visual (in other words, keep the volume on and up)- The radar detected approaching vehicles 100% of the time and about 85% sooner than my hearing did- I found the biggest benefit comes when I have to merge from the shoulder of the road out into traffic to make left hand turns or move out from a right only lane. As I have aged (now 65 years old) I don\u2019t have the flexibility to turn around and look like I once had and this device helps in indicating if there is oncoming traffic and if there is, I can adjust my speed to slow down (or speed up) until it is clear. But make no mistake, DO NOT RELY SOLELY ON THE RADAR. Always use your eyes and ears!- I can say, from my limited experience, that the battery life seems solid and unless you\u2019re doing 6+ hour rides (just my estimate), you will be fine and won\u2019t run out of juice- Speaking of battery life, using the Varia app while using the Strava app to log my ride, I used up approximately 15% of my iPhone\u2019s battery on a 2 hour rideMy only gripe is that there is no integration with my Apple Watch. It would be very beneficial to have haptic alerts. I did find a third party app that supposedly does this but have not purchased it ($5.99).This device may not be for everyone but if you are looking for some added, reliable safety when you ride, it is worth it and, in my opinion, at a reasonable price.",

        "review": "The Garmin Varia RTL515 has become an essential part of my cycling setup, providing invaluable safety features that I rely on every ride. The integration with my Garmin Edge 840 is seamless and enhances my situational awareness on the road. It effectively alerts me to approaching vehicles, giving me critical information to adjust my riding position and stay safe.One of the standout features is its light patterns that dynamically change as vehicles approach. This not only increases my visibility to drivers but also helps them anticipate my presence on the road. While the mounting system it comes with is functional, I opted for a better mounting solution to ensure a more secure attachment. This upgrade has significantly improved the stability of the Varia RTL515 on my bike, providing peace of mind during rides. The build quality is robust, and the device is weather-resistant, handling various conditions without issue. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long rides without needing a recharge.Overall, the Garmin Varia RTL515 is an indispensable tool for cyclists prioritizing safety. Its reliable connectivity, advanced alert system, and adaptive lighting make it a must-have for anyone serious about staying safe on the road. I highly recommend it, especially with a sturdier mounting option, for enhanced security and performance.",

        "review": "I just returned to road riding from a few long seasons of triathlon racing where 95% of my rides were indoors on a trainer, so I wanted to take advantage of the newer technology to improve my safety on roads.  This radar has been flawless and pairs effortlessly with both my Stages M200 and Magese C606 computers.  Light is plenty bright, battery life is very good, and it performs without fault.  My only gripe was the mount which wasn't the most confidence inspiring holding a $200 light.  I purchased a hard mount replacement and it's not rock solid.It's money well spent for the piece of mind I have while riding, and works great for knowing when cars are approaching from behind.  I also find myself able to ride out in the road a little more, avoiding the shoulder where debris and potential tire poppers lurk.  10/10 would buy again, even at the price.  I often purchase less expensive versions of cycling gear which perform great, but didn't want to take the chance on such a vital piece of kit where failure isn't an option.",

        "review": "I finally gave in and bought this item after reading so many great reviews -- so glad I did. This is the real deal for any cyclist who wants to be safe.In my attempt to be safer while riding, I'd added a bar mirror as craning my neck and relying on sound never felt safe, and while the mirror helped a little, it always seemed like it took a moment to register what I was looking at and how close an approaching car was.The Varia really solved a lot of that. I was concerned that it would not work well with my small monochrome Garmin Edge 130 bike computer, but it actually works really well, showing each car as a moving dot along a small line on the screen. This is very helpful when you're on a quiet road away from the city that has no bike line or shoulder. I always felt uneasy on those roads not knowing what was behind me and would ride close to the edge of the road. The Varia lets me ride on the smoothest part of the road until I get an alert beep that a car is behind me, and I can move over. This peace of mind is almost priceless.It's also nice that it was a built-in light as a flashing rear light is an absolute must, in my mind.This is a well-built, well-designed item, easy to charge, easy to mount -- although the rubber strap for the mount doesn't seem super secure, although honestly it has not been a problem, and there are plenty of third party mounts you can buy.Like so many others have said, the Varia is a absolute home run.",

As my eyes age though, the screen on the other Garmin watches was difficult to read in low light, and you had to push a button to use the backlight.\u00a0 The Epix fixes all that for me.\u00a0 The large OLED screen is bright enough to see in any light, and with a flick of the wrist, the screen wakes up.\u00a0 Though the touchscreen works well, old habits die hard and I tend to use the physical buttons more than the screen. They work exactly the same as the Fenix. The usual suite of Garmin software and apps makes it a useful ecosystem to be in.\u00a0 The fitness tracking appears to be accurate, and while the sleep tracking may not be, it does seem consistent for me at least.\u00a0 I don't generally use the built-in mapping, because I usually have my phone and it drains the battery quickly, but the times I have used it, the maps look great and track properly. There are tons of watch faces to help customize as well.\u00a0 The bands are the same as the Fenix watches (not sure about the 8) so there are plenty of replacements on Amazon.\u00a0 And they are the easiest bands to change out as well.\u00a0 The battery is usually about 2 weeks at most, which is sufficient for me; it charges quickly and though it's not a month, it will do.\u00a0 The one complaint I would have is the charger itself.\u00a0 I dislike proprietary chargers, only in that I have to have an extra cable in my bag that already has plenty of extra cables.

However, while the AWU is a great smartwatch and has far better interaction, notification and connection to other Apple devices the AWU has horrendous batter life and it's fitness tracking is not as good as Garmin. Both watches have their place and I'll keep the AWU as it does have it's place.Regarding the Epix G2, the amoled screen is excellent, bright vibrant color, works well enough in direct sun and still, even with AOD enabled allows for multi-week battery. Compared to a day and a half on the AWU this is amazing. Workout tracking, step tracking and mapping are great and work as well as the AWU. Also I prefer that the Epix is round, watches should be round. Once the weather gets better I am looking forward to comparing the Epix G2 to my Garmin Edge 1000, if the EG2 works well enough as a cycling computer I'll likely sell the Edge as I don't need two cycling computers.Overall I'm very happy with the watch, it does many things excellent, some things good.

        "review": "The Garmin Enduro is a significant upgrade from the Fenix 6 Sapphire. The primary issue I had with the Fenix was its limited battery life, which the Enduro addresses remarkably well. I can now enjoy nearly 3 weeks of consistent heavy usage, compared to the 3 days I had with the Fenix 6S. This improvement eliminates the frustration of starting a workout only to find my watch running low on juice.The Enduro 3 also introduces several new features that enhance the user experience. Training Readiness and Endurance Score, both absent from the Fenix 6, are particularly useful for me. I can now assess my training readiness and plan my workouts accordingly, or opt for a rest day if the analytics tell me that a rest day would be more beneficial. Additionally, the sleep tracking on the Enduro 3 seems more refined and accurate.Despite its larger size (10mm more), I find the Enduro 3 lighter than my old Fenix. However, I don\u2019t mind the extra bulk since it offers more features and improves the solar charging capability over the Garmin watches with smaller faces. A notable difference to the Fenix 8 (which I looked at closely before choosing the Enduro) is that the  Enduro 3 lacks voice features. But, as currently implemented, I consider the voice feature a gimmick that I would rarely use. I would only consider voice functionality if Garmin integrated a cellular connection and call-making capabilities, but that hasn\u2019t been announced for the Fenix line.  Hopefully, that is something they are considering adding since I\u2019d like to do workouts near my home without dragging along my cell phone.Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with the latest version of the Enduro by Garmin. While it may be larger, its lightweight design and exceptional battery life make it an ideal choice for my need of a no-frills fitness tracker with remarkable battery life. If you\u2019re looking for something like that, I highly recommend the Enduro 3.",

        "review": "I've had a Fenix 3, a Fenix 5, a Bulova Precisionist, a Citizen Eco-Drive, a high-end ProTrek, and two Apple Watches in the last several years.  In a way, the Apple Watches were way ahead of everyone else, in that they can do EVERYTHING.  At the same time, though, the Apples were a little fragile, and are tightly tethered to being recharged.  The Eco-Drive and the ProTrek had the advantage of solar power, which allows them to keep going when the power is out for extended periods, including cataclysms of various sorts, but they didn't do very many things, including no heart rate.I don't remember now why I sold the Fenix 5, but I remember being impressed with its durable construction, its multiplied resources for exercise and outdoor use, plus amazing battery life.  Garmin has been working on solar power for several years, now, and the new Enduro 3 maximizes battery life plus it has the same software and capabilities of the Fenix 8--with the exception of a MIP screen instead of AMOLED, no speaker or microphone, and no diving capabilities (though it is waterproof to 10 ATM).  Some reviewers say the Enduro 3 is the best watch Garmin has ever made.I encourage you to check the specs on the Enduro 3.  It really is quite remarkable.  It's light, and easy to wear all the time.  It's G-Shock quality, with sapphire glass and all the bells and whistles of Garmin's latest OS.  It would be nice to have the glitter of AMOLED, but those screens eat batteries, and battery life was my central criterion.  I also wanted a digital watch, not an analog one, and satellite nav with good maps.  Check.The Garmin store can't be compared to Apple's for add-ons, but I have found the Falcon Z and the BIG EASY watch faces to provide all the customization I really need.  Yes, it's expensive, but I've paid as much for watches before and gotten much less.",

No more dead watch stress!If you\u2019re a Garmin user who travels a lot or just wants the peace of mind of always having a charger handy, these are a must-have. Highly recommend!",

        "review": "Is it possible for a small, $10 purchase to be one of the best Amazon purchases I have ever made? In the case of these adaptors, the answer is yes. Background:1. I have had a Garmin Vivoactive watch for several years now. I really like the watch and don't need a new one. My only complaint (which evidently applies to lots of smart watches) is that fact that the charging ports require a proprietary plug, so a micro-USB or USB-C port is usually not an option.2. So for several years I have had to keep up with yet ANOTHER charging cord. I travel a lot so that adds to the hassle. On top of that, the plug ends often get slightly bent, and either require some unnecessary wiggling and maneuvering just to get the cord to fit, or it won't fit into my watch at all. And even when the plugs that aren't bent, they often don't secure very well, such that when it looks like the watch should be charging, it isn't (this has happened to me numerous times; I plug the watch in, come back an hour later and it is still dead).3. I just threw away a charging cord for not working well and I saw these adaptors on Amazon. I hoped that for $10 they would be useful.What an amazing product. They snap tightly onto the USB-C cord that most all of us have readily available everywhere. Even better, the end that plugs into the watch fits far more snugly and securely than any Garmin cord that I have owned before--it almost came as a revelation, as in \"you mean this watch always had the ability to be more securely connected and I am only discovering it now?\"I also appreciate the three pack, to include an angled version. In fact that is the one that is in the photo I have attached. This product is new to me, so perhaps there will be issues in the future. But for now, if you are a Garmin watch user that requires this plug attachment, I highly recommend these.",

With the excellent battery life, I haven't needed to charge it more than every couple weeks.. but over time the factory charging cable got more finnicky.  Had to prop the watch just so with lateral force to get it to stay connected for charging.  It appears that one of the four spring loaded pins was not protruding as much as the others.  Perhaps it was bent a little.  These connectors are working great out of the box.  You actually have to push a little harder to seat it so the pins don't push it back out.  Seems the springs have more force and less stiction.  Hopefully this work for a long time so I can defer spending a grand on a newer Fexix model... because I really like my 6x!",

Recently, coming home in the dark I would have got back to camp without this GPS but I would have put on a lot of extra miles. My gut was saying to go in one direction but the Garmin Tread said to go in another direction. I went the Garmin direction! I was so glad I had it. Once my gut and the Garmin came into alignment it made sense why the \"all seeing eye\" of the Garmin Tread said to go the way it did!I know the price tag is high. I choked on it as well. But if you can get past the price bring this GPS if for nothing more than the large screen and for the how it connects to other cameras. I no longer need my Garmin 62.Honestly, in the old days I used a Topo map and compass to get around. That system is still relevant but using the Garmin is so much better. For night time driving out in the wilds the Garmin Tread is superior to my Garmin handheld GPS. Do I still keep a compass in my pocket? You bet!",

        "review": "I would like to start out that I have used Garmin GPS's in there various incarnations for nearly 30 years. I purchased the Tread for both on & off road use. The 1st thing I did upon receipt of the unit was to connect it to the computer and run any updates, well it does not like to update via usb but it does like to update via wifi so just a heads up, the initial updates did not take long less than 1 hour. The 2nd thing I did was try it with a GTM-60 traffic receiver I already have that is used with other models, according to the compatibility list it is not compatible, but I noticed the \"overlander\" was compatible which is the same OS as the Tread and sure enough when i plugged it in it did a little firmware update to the GTM-60 and it works great as noted in my photo it gets digital updates where they are provided (digital is not broadcast in all city's).  Functionally it has a lot of features some of which I may never use but they are there if you need them. The search function works great, you no longer have to search by city/state/etc to find many things you just put what you want in search and bam there it is. Out of the box it has a lot of boundary lines enabled for everything A~Z so much that it can make the map just a bit too much you may have a hard time determining what is a property boundary line and what is a trail or road or street so I turned some of the boundary markers off to make it more suitable to my needs. Some of those markers are useful for off-road ONLY, when I am in the city I don't need to see joe smo's property lines.  The OS is nice you will get a single tone alert for upcoming speed limit changes, a detail will come up on the right side showing the next street/exit, etc and how far away it is and by this I mean it will show them purely as information and not necessarily as your next turn if navigating I like the feature. OFF-Road mapping is \"ok\" there are some places I have gone to and have driven and the mapping is just not in the data, that's not a defect of the device it's a mapping issue and should be expected to a certain degree depending on where you travel. Birds eye view is \"interesting\" if you download the birds eye it literally shows a birds eye view which includes just trees and no road if the road is under the tree canopy there is no overlay for the road on the map in that case.  Accuracy is the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, accuracy is pretty good most of the time but there was a couple cases of it \"drifting\" a bit maybe a few hundred feet at most not sure why, could be the satellite was on the edge of the horizon or something. I have traveled with it for a few thousand miles now and have confidence in it for the most part . I purchased a window suction mount separate because it does not come with one, I though it might \"fall off\" the window because it is a little heavy because of the big built in battery but even with some rough off roading it has not fallen off, the colored plastic trim pieces it comes with seem a little janky but it has not been dropped or anything yet when it does I expect the trim piece of pop off like a lego set otherwise it seems sturdy. It has not frozen up or done anything weird as of yet the os seems stable. If you are on the couch about buying one go for it, great gps.",

I guess I\u2019m used to easy GoPro mounts, but I couldn\u2019t find any that fit my bars. I will say I was in a hurry, and should have gave myself more time, but this seemed just way too complicated.It feels solid, and seems like it has some nice features like listening to music and such, but who really cares.So my plan is to get a rugged mount for my old iPhone, get an app that downloads trails offline, and just use that. Sucks because I really wanted to like this unit, but I feel like my 10 year old Garmin Navi was easier than this.",

We thought try out the Garmin on a recent trip and with some programing practice it turned out to be extremely helpful beyond all expectations.We are no longer driving anywhere now without it. Programing is not complicated but practice does matter since you need to read as well as click on symbols in combination to enter, save, and use the location information. If you make mistakes just keep working on it and we are confident that in no time the value in using it will become readily apparent. It always knows where you are geographically, has saved info on numerous locations, you can easily add your own and change things while in transit. We mount it inside on the windshield so that the driver and passenger can both view the display. A woman's voice supplies advanced directions, it simply works great. You enter information on a touch screen do not use your finger the eraser end of a pencil works without error and does not harm the screen. Once home we deleted all the travel locations and entered our local information. If you make a wrong turn it knows it and directs you back on the route. Please understand that the route it chooses may not be your first or regular choice. It appears to us that it is always looking for the shortest distance between the two points. We always use a toll road to reach our local airport but Garmin wants to use the interstate so we just ignore it and take the toll road and it calculates new directions automatically along the way. We should have purchased this device years ago.",

We thought try out the Garmin on a recent trip and with some programing practice it turned out to be extremely helpful beyond all expectations.We are no longer driving anywhere now without it. Programing is not complicated but practice does matter since you need to read as well as click on symbols in combination to enter, save, and use the location information. If you make mistakes just keep working on it and we are confident that in no time the value in using it will become readily apparent. It always knows where you are geographically, has saved info on numerous locations, you can easily add your own and change things while in transit. We mount it inside on the windshield so that the driver and passenger can both view the display. A woman's voice supplies advanced directions, it simply works great. You enter information on a touch screen do not use your finger the eraser end of a pencil works without error and does not harm the screen. Once home we deleted all the travel locations and entered our local information. If you make a wrong turn it knows it and directs you back on the route. Please understand that the route it chooses may not be your first or regular choice. It appears to us that it is always looking for the shortest distance between the two points. We always use a toll road to reach our local airport but Garmin wants to use the interstate so we just ignore it and take the toll road and it calculates new directions automatically along the way. We should have purchased this device years ago.",

It quickly locks onto satellite signals, even in dense forests or remote areas, providing consistent and reliable location data.It comes preloaded with detailed maps, and the ability to add more maps is a huge plus. This is perfect for outdoor enthusiasts who need various types of terrain maps at their fingertips.One of the standout features is its impressive battery life. It can last for several days on a single charge when used intermittently, which is ideal for multi-day trips.The device feels robust and well-built. It\u2019s waterproof, impact-resistant, and designed to withstand harsh outdoor conditions.The GPSMAP 67 includes a variety of helpful tools such as an altimeter, barometer, and compass. These are great additions for those who need more than just GPS for navigation.Cons:While the device is packed with features, there\u2019s a bit of a learning curve to fully utilize them. The interface could be a bit more user-friendly, especially for beginners.It\u2019s on the expensive side, but given the level of functionality and durability, I think it\u2019s worth the investment if you spend a lot of time outdoors.Overall, the Garmin GPSMAP 67 is a top-tier GPS device for serious adventurers. It combines accuracy, durability, and long battery life in one package, making it a reliable companion for all outdoor expeditions. Highly recommended for hikers, explorers, and anyone needing precise navigation in rugged environments!",

Map abilities are amazing.  Screen resolution is very good.  Not as high as an iPhone but it's very purpose built so it's great for navigation and assessment.  GPS accuracy is remarkable with the multi-band GPS.  Most of the time, you only need GPS.Battery life is unbelievable.  I've always had the 8-15 hours on 2 AA or rechargeable.  To have a battery that lasts 4-5 days makes it so even if you forget to turn it off, you will rarely be in situations where it renders you inoperable.  Also, you don't need to carry extra batteries or charger unless you are on a longer adventure.The \"down\" side (not really).  The interface is so feature-packed that it does have a learning curve.  Once you have it, it is cake to use.  It works wonderfully with Garmin Explore.  You can download your favorite track from Alltrails or other sites and import them into collections.  They sync via your iphone or laptop effortlessly (setting up phone connection can have some issues but is a set and forget thing).Overall, this thing is rugged beast that covers a fantastic range of functionality.  TheHikingGuy indicated he doesn't need it because of his Garmin watch of which I have one.  It is so much nicer to have a handheld that has a bigger screen for map reading and orientation without needing to unfold a map unless absolutely necessary.  If you are a serious hiker, you are probably carrying a satellite device anyways and this thing is so worth adding a couple ounces of weight in my opinion.If you are thinking about it and have the budget - Go for it!",

        "review": "After about 6 rides of more than 20+ miles each, I feel comfortable writing a review about the Garmin Varia RTL515. First, let me say that this Radar with Taillight works exactly as advertised and I can easily recommend it to any bike rider. That said, here are what I hope may be some helpful notes:- I use the radar with my iPhone 14 Pro and the associated Varia app- It took me less than 10 minutes to unpackage, mount, install the app and pair to my phone (note that for my rides my iPhone is attached to a mount on the handlebars)- Some have reported issues with the mounting hardware that comes with the device. I encountered no issues at all (installing or while riding)- Be sure to use the audible sounds and not just the visual (in other words, keep the volume on and up)- The radar detected approaching vehicles 100% of the time and about 85% sooner than my hearing did- I found the biggest benefit comes when I have to merge from the shoulder of the road out into traffic to make left hand turns or move out from a right only lane. As I have aged (now 65 years old) I don\u2019t have the flexibility to turn around and look like I once had and this device helps in indicating if there is oncoming traffic and if there is, I can adjust my speed to slow down (or speed up) until it is clear. But make no mistake, DO NOT RELY SOLELY ON THE RADAR. Always use your eyes and ears!- I can say, from my limited experience, that the battery life seems solid and unless you\u2019re doing 6+ hour rides (just my estimate), you will be fine and won\u2019t run out of juice- Speaking of battery life, using the Varia app while using the Strava app to log my ride, I used up approximately 15% of my iPhone\u2019s battery on a 2 hour rideMy only gripe is that there is no integration with my Apple Watch. It would be very beneficial to have haptic alerts. I did find a third party app that supposedly does this but have not purchased it ($5.99).This device may not be for everyone but if you are looking for some added, reliable safety when you ride, it is worth it and, in my opinion, at a reasonable price.",

        "review": "The Garmin Varia RTL515 has become an essential part of my cycling setup, providing invaluable safety features that I rely on every ride. The integration with my Garmin Edge 840 is seamless and enhances my situational awareness on the road. It effectively alerts me to approaching vehicles, giving me critical information to adjust my riding position and stay safe.One of the standout features is its light patterns that dynamically change as vehicles approach. This not only increases my visibility to drivers but also helps them anticipate my presence on the road. While the mounting system it comes with is functional, I opted for a better mounting solution to ensure a more secure attachment. This upgrade has significantly improved the stability of the Varia RTL515 on my bike, providing peace of mind during rides. The build quality is robust, and the device is weather-resistant, handling various conditions without issue. The battery life is impressive, lasting through long rides without needing a recharge.Overall, the Garmin Varia RTL515 is an indispensable tool for cyclists prioritizing safety. Its reliable connectivity, advanced alert system, and adaptive lighting make it a must-have for anyone serious about staying safe on the road. I highly recommend it, especially with a sturdier mounting option, for enhanced security and performance.",

This radar has been flawless and pairs effortlessly with both my Stages M200 and Magese C606 computers.  Light is plenty bright, battery life is very good, and it performs without fault.  My only gripe was the mount which wasn't the most confidence inspiring holding a $200 light.  I purchased a hard mount replacement and it's not rock solid.It's money well spent for the piece of mind I have while riding, and works great for knowing when cars are approaching from behind.  I also find myself able to ride out in the road a little more, avoiding the shoulder where debris and potential tire poppers lurk.  10/10 would buy again, even at the price.  I often purchase less expensive versions of cycling gear which perform great, but didn't want to take the chance on such a vital piece of kit where failure isn't an option.",

        "review": "I finally gave in and bought this item after reading so many great reviews -- so glad I did. This is the real deal for any cyclist who wants to be safe.In my attempt to be safer while riding, I'd added a bar mirror as craning my neck and relying on sound never felt safe, and while the mirror helped a little, it always seemed like it took a moment to register what I was looking at and how close an approaching car was.The Varia really solved a lot of that. I was concerned that it would not work well with my small monochrome Garmin Edge 130 bike computer, but it actually works really well, showing each car as a moving dot along a small line on the screen. This is very helpful when you're on a quiet road away from the city that has no bike line or shoulder. I always felt uneasy on those roads not knowing what was behind me and would ride close to the edge of the road. The Varia lets me ride on the smoothest part of the road until I get an alert beep that a car is behind me, and I can move over. This peace of mind is almost priceless.It's also nice that it was a built-in light as a flashing rear light is an absolute must, in my mind.This is a well-built, well-designed item, easy to charge, easy to mount -- although the rubber strap for the mount doesn't seem super secure, although honestly it has not been a problem, and there are plenty of third party mounts you can buy.Like so many others have said, the Varia is a absolute home run.",

I downloaded the Garmin dezl app, make sure that you don't try to use the Garmin drive app, it doesn't work with this unit, and that connected instantly too. Bluetooth and WiFi capabilities helped that process too.As far as features, this little gem is packed. Everything you need to navigate your route with some nice touches to enhance that experience as well. There are far too many to get into here but YouTube the unit and you'll some good videos from professional drivers to help explain them.I've used it for a week as of this writing and have nothing at all to complain about. Intuitive interface, great customization features, and directions/routing are spot-on.All-in-all, great unit at a great price for what you get. Just one thing though, buy the Gamin dash mount for this unit. That thing that comes in the box will not withstand the vibrations and bumps that are commonplace with big trucks. You'll thank yourself later!",

The unit is a little clumsy to use unlike some of the others but definitely better than Rand McNally. All in all I think this is probably one of the best units truckers can expect and it usually did the job pretty good. Not too many hiccups. Once in awhile it would draw blank and I'd have to do research to figure out where I was going. That really shouldn't happen but it's not Amazon's fault. They gave me the brand new unit and a decent price and delivered it in a hurry",

        "review": "I bought my Garmin dezl 800 back in early 2021, and it's been ALMOST a pure joy to use. I have one serious criticism: in trying to cut corners on cheap parts like processor and memory, Garmin decided to put the absolute minimum power the unit, which affects performance when it's been running for a week.>Why would you run it for a week without rebooting?I'm glad you asked. You see, this thing takes a minimum of 20 minutes to cold boot from the power-off state. That, and the minimal memory causing occasional errors which crash the GPS app portion of the system (which auto-recovers, taking about 10 minutes to restart), are the flies in this otherwise impeccable soup. So far, after using it throughout 2021 and 2022 and a third of 2024, I've had the map app crash on me as I was nearing my exit twice. Yes, only twice, fortunately, but that caused me to have to be quick about programming google maps to get me to my destination. In traffic. Using voice command. Not too terrible, but not exactly an ideal situation to be in.Other than this one irksome flaw, the machine is about as perfect as a standalone GPS can be expected to be. Without this problem, I would have rated it 5 stars.Yes, the dezl 810 has a better processor and more memory (2x as much) but they REMOVED an important feature: side by side comparison of time and distance of alternate routes selected via route shaping. I'll never buy an 810 unless they add that feature back in or my 800 dies.",

        "review": "After almost a year of using this, I have come to a final conclusion that this thing sucks! Not the unit itself, but Garmin and their 'programmers' who program this thing with SUPPOSED truck routes! It AVOIDS routes that trucks ARE ALLOWED to use, and sends you down roads that trucks ARE NOT supposed to use! I use this in the northeast, mainly NY and PA, and it's all but useless outside of main interstates! I don't know why it's so hard to accurately program a GPS with truck routes but apparently it's beyond the capabilities of the geniuses at Garmin. I mean if you can't trust the leader in GPS navigation, who CAN you trust? I've had even worse results with Rand McNally. Is it that they just don't care about the northeast? Or is it this way across the whole country? I have completely lost faith in Garmin, this wasn't cheap and now I'm stuck with it. Gee, sure looks pretty though...  I left my original review below, which was initially positive, but having used this for a while now, Garmin has shown their true colors, even with the latest updates!Below is my original review. I do NOT feel this way anymore.Let's face it, trucker GPS's primary purpose is to make money for the manufacturers. Hard truth but it is the truth. I have had many over the years including trucker navigation software for my laptop. Most have been horrible, even if using for a car! I recently used CoPilot for my cell phone, and though it seemed almost ok, it was not very easy to use and lacked many features you'd expect to be available. In 2014 I bought a Rand McNally tablet truck GPS and was highly disappointed. Then I tried a Garmin Dezl 770 with marginally acceptable results, basically it was good enough to remind me of a turn coming up on the route that I had to 'build' to the point of just not using it anymore, the mount sucked (couldn't be tightened, wouldn't stay straight), another disappointment. I had no idea what direction to go for my next trucker GPS and did a lot of research and read and watched many reviews on the OTR Series tablet GPS units for trucks.Most people are still saying avoid the Rand McNally's, they're still junk both in quality and functionality, which really surprises me since they publish the Bible of a truckers atlas. Apparently the atlas division doesn't speak to the GPS division...So after MUCH intense research well into the night, I decided to take a chance on the Dezl OTR1000 model.The good: almost everything! You can now FINALLY update the thing without hooking it up to a computer! Magnetic mount (stroooong too), can use in portrait or landscape, the mount is heavy duty, well made, the unit is quite loud (many complained about this so they must have fixed the issue), the screen is amazing and it processes routes quicker than any GPS I've ever used. There's just too much to add. It works, got it this morning and spent all day (it's now 2:30 am) running it through my tests. It actually knows where to go! So far so good. I'll update this review in a month or so after I've actually used it in the truck. I love how you can send directions (I use actual coordinates copied from Google Maps) directly to the GPS in seconds.The bad: it runs Android 6...really? 6? This means good luck finding any apps that will even download onto it. And WHAT GPS DOESN'T COME WITH A CALCULATOR? Most of us aren't mathematicians but we don't have to be, but come on man, we DO use numbers daily.Overall, at this point, I'm very happy with it and I think it actually knows where my truck should or should not be. I'll update this later. For now, while pricey and no, I don't think any piece of plastic is worth that kind of money, I would recommend this.",

        "review": "I have used this rangefinder for about 10 rounds on a few different courses. I\u2019ve used other rangefinders and recently have been using GPS software on my phone. I never enjoyed using my phone on the course due to the distraction.This device is just fun to use. There is a slight delay for the device to wake up, but it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I end up using the GPS functionality even more than the laser. They\u2019ve done an amazing job with the software UI to give you a ton of information very quickly. I do wish there was a shortcut to get to the score card quickly.The pin finder function is surprisingly useful (pro tip, don\u2019t wear a hat with a magnetic ball marker). One drawback is that you can\u2019t use a magnet attachment with this rangefinder due to the compass. I use a bag with a magnet flap and that doesn\u2019t seem to bother it.The laser is very accurate and grabs the flag quickly. The overlay of the ranged distance on the hole overview is just awesome. I end up playing a lot of evenings. One benefit of this device is makes the flag easy to see even when getting dark. It amplifies the ambient light and makes it easy to see.The battery life is probably the only drawback. I usually need to charge about every other round. I keep a backup battery in my bag so even if I forget to charge, I can plug in while getting ready. It actually charges very quickly.The connection to the phone works great and very cool how the score updates from the rangefinder into the Garmin golf app.In summary, this is a premium device at a premium price. At first I struggled with the idea of spending $500+ on a rangefinder, but very glad I did.",

        "review": "I was divided between this, and the ultra reliable Bushnell X2.  Trusted reliability plus a battery that will last a year or more were powerful arguments for the X2, but the built in GPS feature with downloaded courses on the Garmin were too tempting to pass on.  I\u2019m glad I bought the Garmin.  I played at a really challenging course with crazy elevation changes, and felt like I was cheating with this thing.  Blind areas aren\u2019t a concern when you get a graphic on your viewfinder showing where every hazard is.  The pinseeker mode was a lifesaver.  With elevation drops of over 100 ft, the \u201cplays like\u201d mode really helped me choose the right club.  Also, the oled screen is very sharp, and as just a rangefinder, it\u2019s ridiculously accurate.For the record, I originally bought the older z80 version and had to factory reset it 3 times in the first week just to get it to work, so I returned it. That made me nervous to buy this, but I\u2019m a bells and whistles guy, so I took the risk and I\u2019m glad. It has a video game like feel to the controls, and it takes a little playing around with to get it down.The downside is that after playing 18 holes, using frequently, I\u2019m at 68% battery, so I\u2019ll probably ending up charging this after 2 rounds of play to be safe.  It charges via USB, so if you have a cart with a USB slot, you can prevent it from draining.One final downside, I wish this thing had a magnet for the frame of the golf cart, or ability to clip onto my pants. The carrying case has a clip, but I don\u2019t like having to put it in and out of its case every hole.",

        "review": "Have to say that I impulse-purchased the Approach Z82 after seeing an ad from Garmin themselves on Facebook.  I\u2019ve used it for seven rounds.  For the purpose of comparing: I\u2019ve had a Leupold GX-4i3 and, most recently, a Bushnell Tour V4 Shift in my range-finding golf career.The accuracy of this rangefinder is just as good as both of my past owns. There is no worry there.  Targeting the flag can be a bit cumbersome for first-time users, but you will definitely get the hang of it, even without a steady hand.  It has the vibration technology just like most others with this feature.  It is roughly the same size and still ergonomically-friendly.  My favorite feature is what the embedded GPS helps bring to the front: the laser range arc.  After you input some of your standard yardages, this feature will ensure that you never second-guess yourself when wanting to clear ponds, fescue, anything.  The automatic switch to green view when you are shooting to the pin as you approach is also really neat - complete with front- and back-of-green yardages.Think that bunker is within driving distance for you? It might not be after you use the hazard view and literally scroll bunker-by-bunker on the hole you\u2019re playing!My only negatives are probably the same as what you might have read elsewhere:1) it is not easy to keep taking it out of its carrying case and putting it back in.  You almost have to leave it out.  However, the case is definitely solid and protective, so that\u2019s the good thing about it.2) you really have to practice going thru all of the copious menu options this thing has BEFORE you play.  And do it many times.  I only did it once.  You\u2019ll hold up your playing partners if you\u2019re not prepared.  But...be prepared to be blown away by what the Z82 can do.3) There is no easy way that I\u2019ve found to resume your round if you accidentally power it down while entering your scorecard (yes, you can do that right on this thing too!!).4) price. Personally I feel it is worth it, having sold my other two to cover the cost. But if you can pull the trigger, you won\u2019t be sorry.This really is a five-star product in my opinion.  If it comes down under $500 and if Garmin can provide a case that makes for easy removal and return, I will move this to five stars.I\u2019m still having a lot of fun with it and am ready for a hot day on the course tomorrow!",

        "review": "The Garmin Enduro is a significant upgrade from the Fenix 6 Sapphire. The primary issue I had with the Fenix was its limited battery life, which the Enduro addresses remarkably well. I can now enjoy nearly 3 weeks of consistent heavy usage, compared to the 3 days I had with the Fenix 6S. This improvement eliminates the frustration of starting a workout only to find my watch running low on juice.The Enduro 3 also introduces several new features that enhance the user experience. Training Readiness and Endurance Score, both absent from the Fenix 6, are particularly useful for me. I can now assess my training readiness and plan my workouts accordingly, or opt for a rest day if the analytics tell me that a rest day would be more beneficial. Additionally, the sleep tracking on the Enduro 3 seems more refined and accurate.Despite its larger size (10mm more), I find the Enduro 3 lighter than my old Fenix. However, I don\u2019t mind the extra bulk since it offers more features and improves the solar charging capability over the Garmin watches with smaller faces. A notable difference to the Fenix 8 (which I looked at closely before choosing the Enduro) is that the  Enduro 3 lacks voice features. But, as currently implemented, I consider the voice feature a gimmick that I would rarely use. I would only consider voice functionality if Garmin integrated a cellular connection and call-making capabilities, but that hasn\u2019t been announced for the Fenix line.  Hopefully, that is something they are considering adding since I\u2019d like to do workouts near my home without dragging along my cell phone.Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with the latest version of the Enduro by Garmin. While it may be larger, its lightweight design and exceptional battery life make it an ideal choice for my need of a no-frills fitness tracker with remarkable battery life. If you\u2019re looking for something like that, I highly recommend the Enduro 3.",

        "review": "I've had a Fenix 3, a Fenix 5, a Bulova Precisionist, a Citizen Eco-Drive, a high-end ProTrek, and two Apple Watches in the last several years.  In a way, the Apple Watches were way ahead of everyone else, in that they can do EVERYTHING.  At the same time, though, the Apples were a little fragile, and are tightly tethered to being recharged.  The Eco-Drive and the ProTrek had the advantage of solar power, which allows them to keep going when the power is out for extended periods, including cataclysms of various sorts, but they didn't do very many things, including no heart rate.I don't remember now why I sold the Fenix 5, but I remember being impressed with its durable construction, its multiplied resources for exercise and outdoor use, plus amazing battery life.  Garmin has been working on solar power for several years, now, and the new Enduro 3 maximizes battery life plus it has the same software and capabilities of the Fenix 8--with the exception of a MIP screen instead of AMOLED, no speaker or microphone, and no diving capabilities (though it is waterproof to 10 ATM).  Some reviewers say the Enduro 3 is the best watch Garmin has ever made.I encourage you to check the specs on the Enduro 3.  It really is quite remarkable.  It's light, and easy to wear all the time.  It's G-Shock quality, with sapphire glass and all the bells and whistles of Garmin's latest OS.  It would be nice to have the glitter of AMOLED, but those screens eat batteries, and battery life was my central criterion.  I also wanted a digital watch, not an analog one, and satellite nav with good maps.  Check.The Garmin store can't be compared to Apple's for add-ons, but I have found the Falcon Z and the BIG EASY watch faces to provide all the customization I really need.  Yes, it's expensive, but I've paid as much for watches before and gotten much less.",

It is very easy to use and I really like the large size.  It is easy to see even in bright sunlight, way better than any of my past models.  I do not use the bluetooth function for the phone or the voice command so I cannot comment on them.  It has built in wifi so once you connect it to your home network, it will automatically download upgrades without connecting to your computer.  If you have purchased custom \"voice\" files, like Dr. Nightmare, they provide no way to install them...at least it is not documented.  You can download them to your computer and then copy them manually to the proper folder in the GPS and they will work fine.I would recommend this GPS for anyone who wants to get from here to there with ease.  It works great!!Dislikes!  I do have a few....1.  I do not like the way this model attaches to the ball mount.  It take two hands to release it whereas all of my other models could be easily released with one hand and they were still very secure in their attachment.2.  I am an avid geocacher, since 2003.  ALL of my past models could easily display geocaches on the screen.  All you had to do was put them in a .gpx file and copy them to the proper folder in the GPS.  THIS model does not do that very well.  You can follow the same procedure but instead of getting the neat little geocaching icons on the screen you get these big ugly icons that look like tabs or signs.  I do not like this at all...big downer.  But the overall good outweighs this downer.  There is a \"workaround\".  You can export your caches to a POI file and copy it to the POI folder in the GPS.  All of the caches will then display on the screen using a much smaller, and less ugly icon.  You can then select one and navigate to it.  The upside to using POI is that you can have more of them.  I easily put in over 3000.  The name of each one will NOT display on the screen, but at least you can see them.  If you touch one, you can navigate to it, or you can quickly find them in the menu.  So.... it works well for geocaching but not quite as well as any of my older, smaller models.3.  I use LINUX on my computer, not Windows.  I also have a MacBook laptop.  ALL of my older model Gamins would plug into Linux or Mac and display on the screen like a disk drive.  You could then drag and drop your .gpx or .poi files over to the proper folder.  THIS model GPS will NOT do that.... not on a Mac and not using Linux.  You MUST have WINDOWS to transfer your files.  This really sucks...  I had to install Windows on my desktop using dual boot just to retain my sanity.  I admit I am a Windows hater.  I could give you reasons but I'll spare you.  So if you are a Windows hater like me, plan on being disappointed.  Again, the good of this GPS outweighs ever this.  It is a keeper.4.  Although this GPS is very very easy to use and easy to figure out, the documentation is poor.  You might even say it sucks but not quite that bad.  If you are a basic user, new to GPS, then the documentation is OK but if you want to do more complicated stuff, you just have to figure it out for yourself.",

        "review": "Really excellent piece of kit that proved totally invaluable for our trip from the UK to Canada.  After years of working from paper maps and internet screen shots - we rented a vehicle in Florida (back in 2019) that came with a dash mounted Garmin as a free upgrade and immediately realised it was taking a huge amount of stress and pre-planning away from us.  Post pandemic and travelling again I decided to buy this unit to make life much easier.  Living in the UK - I was able to order this GPS (SatNav) on Amazon.com (rather than Amazon.co.uk) and have it delivered to me in the UK direct from the USA.  It is a great sized unit that is very very easy and intuitive to use and for the driver to see and read as you are driving.  Like all GPS (SatNav) units it can very occasionally get small things wrong - but 99.999% it was very accurate.  Anyone travelling to Canada - be warned that mobile/cell phone costs in Canada are unbelievably high - therefore EVEN with a USA/Canadian sim card in our phone - it would have cost a fortune to buy enough data in Canada (not necessarily the same in the USA which had much cheaper mobile/cell phone charges) to use a smart phone as a GPS/SatNav.  Therefore we found it much more cost effective to buy the GPS/SatNav outright and it will work for years for future visits.One last thing about this model - after doing loads of research online - it tells you that this model is designed to work in tandem with a connected mobile/cell phone in order to receive traffic updates.  It tells you this model works perfectly well as a GPS/SatNav on its own - but will not give live traffic updates without a connected mobile/cell phone  -  I considered this before buying - but decided that route guidance was enough and more important to me that anything else.  HOWEVERE - after arriving in Canada - this device WAS giving us live traffic reports and rerouting to take the least congested routes - and we did NOT pair it with a mobile/cell phone - but still received live traffic reports.Great unit - Highly Recommended",

        "review": "While I normally use my phone to navigate, I decided that it was time to add a dedicated GPS receiver to my kit and I'm glad I did.  Having a dedicated GPS saves my phone's battery for emergencies, plus it's always good to have multiple navigation items (GPS units, Map and Compass)when you are relying on them for life and death situations.The accuracy of this unit is outstanding, normally around 6ft, and satellite acquisition is very quick.  This unit feature multi-band support and multi-GNSS, which supports GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and QZSS.  There won't be many situations where you will have difficulty getting a satellite lock.  I've even been impressed by the accuracy indoors, a feat I would never have attempted with the GPS units of yore.The interface is a little dated, but intuitive enough and easy to read.  This unit has dedicated buttons, which is vastly superior to using a touch screen in bad weather and/or with gloves.  The build quality is rugged and weather resistant, I have no doubt it will survive tough outdoor use.Battery life has been great for me, even using alkaline batteries.  I like having the option to use standard AA batteries.  Integrated Li-Ions have a finite life, with AA's I can replace the batteries and extend the life of the unit.  This was a selling point to me.Be sure to perform a firmware update before using the unit.  This can either be done via the mobile app or on a computer via USB with the Garmin Express app.  The built in Garmin active topo maps are pretty good.  You can upload your own custom maps as well.I'm looking forward to using this unit on many upcoming backcountry adventures, it fits all of my needs and is relatively affordable.  If you compare it to the cost of a subscription based GPS phone app, it will pay for itself in a few years.",

There\u2019s very little workflow on why and which to use for what. The default non-paid topo maps are not set to have map details set to \u201cmore\u201d or \u201cmost\u201d which are buried deeeeeeeeeeep in map settings. This single default setting I think causes massive poor feedback by Garmin first time owners. Loading free maps is a nightmare at best, using base camp if a pain in the penis best case. Base camp crashed on me 3 times to add a future hiking route about 7mi long. It\u2019s just\u2026 bad. UI of the unit itself really needs a complete overhaul this company need a more Apple like approach, take a look at their source code APIs it\u2019s terrible and you can tell that they are hardware folks trying to do good hardware with crappy softy on top.The good is also very prevalent, laser accuracy with multi band. People don\u2019t seem to realize multi band gets you on avg 6\u2019 of accuracy (that\u2019s the width of ur arms stretched out) from L1 and L5 bands that have accuracy validation. Routing once done works great. Free maps are pretty awesome once you spend a lot of time figuring them out. Text notifications from ur mobile device is pretty sweet. Compass and multi axis sensors get u very good elevation precision. I have major piece of mind once I took 4-6hrs to install and google searches to figure it all out. I\u2019d challenge Garmin to get better senior level software developers and get their act together with multi apps to handle one device. Once that comes about with better and small tech, I\u2019d be very excited to see what happens!",

        "review": "Purchased for an indoor budget simulator. Would recommend RCT balls as they pick it up better than regular balls. I hit roughly 200 chip shots and the R10 picks up on every slight mistake I do so I find it very accurate. Woods can be shorter than on the course but I would attribute that to the firm ground and roll outside. The biggest issue is having shots that don't pick up. Short chips (<10 yards) are virtually impossible, and drivers often don't register due to their lack of height. The R10 goes into standby mode often and I occasionally having to press the button on the back to reset it. I would suggest buying an alignment/leveling stand because if the R10 isn't facing the ball at the correct angle then misreads can happen. The camera almost never works for me. Software/app is mediocre, but the R10 integrates with several other programs nicely (TGC, E6, GSPro). The nuances are absolutely worth the price difference between other monitors on the market, if you're just looking for something to give you good numbers and run other software. I considered trading up to a Mevo+ but the readings were the same for both monitors and the Mevo+ putting was so bad that it wasn't worth it.",

        "review": "You have to like the price of this device and it is good Garmin is finally getting them back in stock.Now that I have used the product outdoors at the range I am updating my review and have added another star.  The R10 works very well as long as you take the time to set it up properly which is true of all launch monitors.  I did not have any other monitors to check the results but had a friend use a range finder to check distances and they were very close.  I did not pay for the subscription yet but I believe it could be used to simulate play at a course in Home Tee Hero with good results.I also want COMMEND the product support team they have worked with to attempt to resolve the issues I have had using the monitor indoors.  Using the Garmin Approach R10 indoors returns data well under what I should be seeing, by at least 20%.  I am an older golfer and the one time I had access to a TrackMan it clocked my swing speed between 65 & 70mph so maybe the algorithms used in R10  penalize slower swings compared to others.  If so, I can hope a firmware or app update fixes addresses this.  Another shortcoming I have found is how many missed shots there are when the clubs speeds drop below 30mph.  I think that it tries to allow for a pre-swing waggle and as a result ignores short, slow chip like swings.  Even below 40mph some the data that is calculated can be missing but it usually captures most shots above 30mph.  This could really impact the ability to use this device in an indoor simulation as chipping would be much more difficult.  The R10 has no way to capture putting so in the simulation it assigns a number of putting strokes based on distance from the pin, I knew this ahead of my purchase and have no issue with it. (I forgot to check this on the range so not sure if it is an indoor only thing or something I am doing wrong, the YouTubers don't seem to have this issue)  If I get that fixed it will be 5 stars for sure.On the plus side other than distance and carry being short, the data the R10 spits out is consistent and appears to be correct based on what I am seeing while using it.  Shots that go to the right of my target are reported as that direction, same for pulled shots that go to the left.  On the driving range app it is a little difficult to tell if there is a draw or a slice, just that it was offline and by how much.  Since it is radar-based lighting has no effect, so using it in a dimly lit garage should not be a problem or affect the data since technically you should be able to use it in the dark.In the end I am glad that I bought it and will continue to use it during practice.  At this price point I doubt there is a better product for the mid to high handicapper looking for feedback on how they struck the ball.  If you buy one make sure you update the firmware as that can make a huge difference depending on when the device was built.And once again product support has been excellent and continues to be quite responsive.",

        "review": "After 11 months using this product inside and outside, comparing data side by side to Trackman at Club Champion, this product is more than worth its price and is nearly identical to trackman #\u2019s. When using the simulator indoors, I highly encourage the Titleist RCT golf balls as it accurately tracks spin due to the reflective layer underneath the balls cover. If you don\u2019t have these balls, it\u2019s an algorithm to estimate spin which can be misleading to true spin numbers. If you\u2019re trying to fit yourself for a new driver, you need those golf balls. Without these balls, my spin was estimated to be around 4,000 RPM which i know is inaccurate. Once i put the balls in play, my spin dropped to my expected 1900-2200 number at 114 mph club head speed.I\u2019m using the r10 with the E6 simulator software and it\u2019s fantastic. The interface is already built in the garmin app, you just need a computer that can run the software. I\u2019ve used awesome golf and it wasn\u2019t realistic enough for me. E6 is LIDAR based and has a yearly subscription that is reasonable. I\u2019m using a gaming computer and have no issues. Again, the RCT balls accurately track spin, even on chips via the E6 software. It wasn\u2019t tracking this on chips (showed 0rpm spin) until I put these balls in place.My yardages are spot on to my exact carry numbers. I don't ever focus on total distance as that is always misleading for any simulator. I found that optimal indoor lightning is absolutely necessary for the simulator to capture each swing. You need ample room (about 8 feet) for the garmin to be able to capture the RCT ball spin #. The best thing about the garmin unit is ability to modify elevation, humidity, and temperature within the garmin app (if using E6 software you can only modify elevation). This is HUGE! Golfers underestimate all three of these factors when playing golf.There are a lot of weekend hacks on youtube that can't use launch monitors to their fullest capacity, and I can genuinely say this is a great unit.I feel you can benefit from this unit and would highly recommend if you\u2019re a data golfer like myself.",

        "review": "I have had an Insight Messenger for almost two years. I used this in a remote part of Madagascar. It functioned perfectly for what it\u2019s designed to do. It\u2019s not for unlimited texting, but it allows essential communication. A smart phone is necessary to send texts through the Garmin InTouch, and makes it lots easier to read texts that are received. If you exceed allotted number of texts for your plan, the cost is reasonable. I did not require emergency assistance, but knowing it was available was reassuring. I use it regularly for an emergency locator when hiking in the US. The ability to directly communicate with emergency response personnel is an extremely attractive feature. Battery life is great, light weight and small. It doesn\u2019t necessarily require a smart phone for emergencies, but the smart phone makes it much easier to use, more comforting, and generally better.",

        "review": "I bought this specifically for fishing trips I take to SE Alaska where we get dropped off at old forest service dry cabins dotted around the Tongass National Forest, 20-30 miles from the nearest town so there's no cell service. This thing worked like a champ in all weather conditions - we didn't have a clear view of the sky, maybe 50% clear coverage from the North and East, the rest being tree coverage, but it was enough where we never had issues sending or receiving messages, or getting weather updates. Longest I think it ever took for a message to get out was about 10 minutes, and that was when it was raining and cloudy. The paired phone app definitely makes it really easy to utilize the device as well, so don't skip that step if you buy one of these.I very much appreciate that Garmin has two different subscription methods - yearly subscription and monthly when you need it. I use the monthly as I only need it a couple times a year, so I just suspend it between usage. Since I use the monthly subscription, it does have a yearly fee involved that the yearly subscription isn't subjected too (something like $35), but compared to $400-500 for a SIM card pre-loaded with minutes on my sat phone that barely works, and where the minutes expire in 6 months, this is a steal!My main complaint is the battery life, in reality if you're sending and receiving a couple dozen texts a day, and it's not perfectly clear skies, expect 2-3 days - this is a very minor gripe as I always come prepared with many methods to recharge my gear. Fortunately, it doesn't eat up much from my battery banks, and it charged just fine with my folding solar panels. Secondly, I haven't figured out a way to charge the device while it's turned off - as soon as I plug it in to charge, it turns on, which often defeats the purpose of what I'm trying to do.Overall, extremely pleased with this purchase, only thing that could make it better is if Garmin teamed up with one of the big satellite companies for better bandwidth so my wife can send me pictures of my dogs over the messenger!",

        "review": "This is a very specialized device and does exactly what it is designed to do - provide for emergency communications when no mobile phone service (or other terrestrial radio service) is available.For me, activation and signup was easy - not Amazon easy - but easy enough, rate plans are clear as is their cost.  Yes, the service plan costs are 'expensive' but this is not a casual use item.Performance exceeded my expectations so far.  Power on to GPS and Sat link is crazy fast, message up/down link varies from instant to tens of seconds.  Link to the phone app works without an issue through it is a separate app which is good and bad - more good I think given that this is focused on life safety vs. casual use.  The \"Mapshare\" feature is actually really nice and allows you to share your tracking point and engage in message exchange with anyone you want without them needing an account or ID, or anything else other than the custom URL you create as part of the signup flow.  You can password protect your map or leave it open to the world.I do strongly recommend using the stored balance feature of the account management side of things.  If you are away from the world for some time and for what ever your CC is declined you might loose access to service which could cost you your life.  If you load a stored balance before you head out that balance will be consumed before a CC is needed again ensuring continued service even if things go off the rails.",

        "review": "I went on a two week trip and was alone for the most part. My family members were able to track me flawlessly wherever I went. All I did was turn on the tracking function every morning. I interfaces with the iPhone without any issues. I used the texting function a few time to try it out. What I liked about it is that it used the phone\u2019s cellular when is was available, otherwise it would switch to satellite. I left it on for a few days and the battery still showed well over 60% charge. It doesn\u2019t have all the functions that the Mini 2 has, but for my application, it\u2019s more than capable and it\u2019s $100 less. The plans are the same, so no changes there. What I also really like is the option to only get a month\u2019s service, so I pay for when I need it, not just when it\u2019s sitting there doing nothing. I don\u2019t travel every month, so this works out well for me. If you\u2019re alone out there, this is what you need. If anything happens, you have the SOS capability. The iPhone 14 and on also has this capability, but the phone is often on my motorcycle and if I\u2019ve fallen and can\u2019t get up (I couldn\u2019t resist using that), the Garmin Messenger is on me at all times.",

        "review": "By far the best Chronograph on the market! It checks every box for ease of use, convenience, and accuracy. Its truly above all others. I can make this statement against my experience owning just about every chronograph out there. Using them weekly checking handgun velocity to meet power factor requirements in competition. Most were dual optical sensor types that work but are inherently finicky requiring timely setup with deflectors, wires, or lighting kits depending on conditions. I also owned one other radar type prior to this one that again worked but was also finicky and took up a lot of space on the bench. The Garmin Xero solves all those issues. Its the easy button of chronographs.  The very nature of radar eliminates the need for specific lighting conditions, use it on sunny days, overcast days, indoors, or at night without any special setups, just use it as is. The Garmin is triggered when it detects a moving object crossing through its emitted radar. It does not utilize an audible trigger to detect and read shots like other radars on the market. That means no errors from unintended triggering from nearby shooters firing (no compromised data from unread triggers). Its setup is as easy as it gets. When you power it up you navigate through a simple and quick start up choosing the usage, handgun, rifle or bow. It will show you a setup position diagram to place it correctly. Its small size is not cumbersome when working around it on a bench. Its not a wall tile towering around to wobble or get incidentally knocked off target. Aiming does not require an aperture sight to get it precisely aligned to your target for proper pickup of shots. Simply just square up the unit by eye in the intended shot line and it will read your shots no problem. I've used this unit regularly for a month to check all my previous data from other units. It has worked flawless and picked up every shot without a single error. The Bluetooth to send data to the free phone app works great. No connection drop issues and data uploads to your app automatically when you \"end the session\" every time. The internal battery lasts for a whole day of shooting. Unit will shut off the emitted radar if it doesn't detect activity after aprox. 15 minutes to prolong battery life. I can say without a doubt this is the best Chronograph on the market in every way. Yes, its expensive, but its worth every penny  considering the dependability and convenience you'll get. Its a complete pleasure to use and never a point of aggravation to ruin a nice day at the range.",

It captures the shots, it\u2019s accurate, it\u2019s compact, no need to set up a bunch of poles, magneto rods, sunshades, a bunch of wires all over the place, none of that stuff. You turn this on, synch it with the app on your phone, and it stores your shots.  It\u2019s a great, simple, easy to use chrono that you set up near the muzzle.  You may have to move it around, but the instructions are simple. Get it, set it, shoot.  It\u2019s that easy!  I love mine, and I\u2019m so glad I got it. I had the Caldwell, and I always had problems with it. This thing is awesome. It makes tracking my load data so easy, and it\u2019s simplified my process for developing my load data. They really hit a home run with this chronograph. If you\u2019re on the fence, then go for it!You too will wait until everyone\u2019s gone to bed and you\u2019ll hold it and admire it, and then the wife comes downstairs and finds you caressing it and secretly writing poetry about it, buying it flowers, sharing all your secrets with it, kinda like when you got that shiny 1911.  You know it\u2019s true, real men of genius. Joking aside, it really is a great chrono.  Take care everyone!!",

        "review": "I hesitated buy the Garmin Xero C1 Pro because of the price.  It seems way too expensive to get me the velocity information I needed.  There are cheaper alternatives and most are of the same old technology as my old Chrony where it reads the bullet (shadow) passing by in order to determine velocity which comes with all sorts of inherent issues such as shade, clouds, muzzle gasses, etc. all resulting in bad readings or errors.  Never mind the risk of shooting your chronograph that is down range from the rifle.So I read a bunch of reviews on the Garmin and decided to give it a reluctant try.  POOF and $640 was gone, but I had my new chronograph and it is TINY.  It is small than the size of my old display unit for my deceased Chrony.  After I got it out of the box, on the charger, and turned on for the first time, I did the initial setup (things like picking English as a language and fps instead of mps, etc.) and waited for it to fully charge.I did not read any instructions.I got it to the range, put it on its little tripod and set it up next to the rifle like I saw in other reviews (I now know it needs to be fairly close to the muzzle), turned it on, selected to start a new session, and started shooting.  It read each shot fired with no dropped shots and no errors.  When I would change to a different load, I would start a new session.  I was able to get the data I needed very quickly and then be on my way to hunt.  ZERO problems were encountered.I have not used the app, though I did download it.  I am not sure what all the app will do, but will explore that in the future.  The unit does not require use of the app (which was a concern I had) to get your basic shooting data (see screen display images.  The first shows the display after a shot and the 2nd shows the summer of the shots for the given load.If you are going to pay a premium price for a bit of kit, you want that bit of kit to be hassle-free and in my experience so far, the Garmin Xero C1 Pro has been hassle free and not only that, soooo much easier to use than my old chronograph.  Setup and breakdown are literally only seconds.  I would spend several minutes each range session aligning my chronograph perfectly and trying a test shot or two to make sure it is set up where it can read my shots and if not, make more adjustments.  Setup for the Garmin Xero C1 Pro was simply a matter of setting it out on the shooting bench next to the rifle out by the muzzle (where you would likely place it so you could readily read the display anyways) and pointing it down range, pressing a button to turn on the power and a button to start a new session.  Even if you don't use the app and forgot to bring a pen to write down the data, no worries, it will save it for you.As I am a night hunter (hogs and pests), it would be nice to be able to use a chronograph after dark.  As the Garmin uses radar to 'see\" the bullet, I should be able to do my range work after dark if I need to do so.I paid a lot of money for this chronograph, but it has not disappointed me in any way thus far.  I am quite pleased with my purchase.",

At $200 less than the Pro X3, it\u2019s a fantastic value, especially since I already own a Garmin Approach watch. The Z30 integrates perfectly with my watch, making it easy to get accurate yardages and manage my game more effectively.One of the best features of the Z30 is how seamlessly it works with my watch. When I shoot the pin's distance with the Z30, it automatically updates the yardage on my watch. Once I\u2019ve locked onto the pin, I don\u2019t have to shoot the distance again\u2014I can rely entirely on my watch for the rest of the hole. This is a huge time-saver and incredibly convenient, making it easier to focus on my game.The Z30 itself is lightweight, easy to use, and locks onto targets quickly with a satisfying vibration. I also love the slope-adjusted distances (PlaysLike Distance), which help with elevation changes, and the \u201cFind My Garmin\u201d feature is a lifesaver if you ever misplace it. The magnetic cart mount is another great touch, keeping it secure and accessible.Overall, the Garmin Approach Z30 is a high-quality rangefinder at a more affordable price. If you\u2019re already in the Garmin ecosystem, it\u2019s a no-brainer. Losing the Pro X3 turned out to be a blessing in disguise!",

        "review": "As a rangefinder it works as expected in this price range--  gives you yardages quickly, vibrates when it locks onto the pin, and clear, bright display.  I especially like the bright red test.  Coming from a Precision Pro NX9 Pro, this was a nice upgrade, though I really enjoy the NX9 Pro at its price point.The standout features of the Z30 are for owners with compatible Garmin watches.  In my case it's the Garmin Approach S62.When the rangefinder locks onto a pin, it will update your watch's \"middle green\" distance with the pin yardage.  Additionally, based on the GPS data, the rangefinder's display will give you how much green you have to work with in front and behind of the pin which is pretty cool (when it works-- keep reading).I've used the Z30 now for close to 10 rounds.  It works 95% of the time as intended, but I have a couple of issues:(1) While you get a pin yardage update on your watch, it obviously doesn't know which part of the green the pin is located.  For example, if the pin is tucked on either side, you'll just get a picture of the green on your watch with the pin along the yardarge returned from the Z30.  You'll have to manually drag the flag to the correct side of the green.  It's not a deal breaker for me necessarily as I'd rather be pin high, but it would be nice to know what side of the green is best to miss  [FEATURE REQUEST:  It would be nice if Garmin would give a more approximate pin placement based on your GPS location relative to the green.](2) There is one hole on the course that I've been testing the Z30 on where the watch GPS yardage is actually shorter than what the Z30 is giving me.  For example, I may get a F/M/B distance of 85/90/95 on my watch, but when I hit the pin with the Z30, it gives me 103.  As a result, I don't get an update in the watch of the pin's distance due to the discrepancy between devices.  I think this is more of an issue with the course data and gps not in sync, and not an issue w/ the Z30 necessarily.All in all, the Z30 came at the right time for me.  I was looking to get into another stat tracking ecosystem, but the added value of the Z30 along with my S62 will keep me around.",

        "review": "I bought the Garmin RV 795 because I have a 24' travel trailer and Google Maps is notorious for misrouting travelers into tight spaces. On a few trips it routed me incorrectly into places that were difficult to get out of in my pickup truck alone and would have been a nightmare with a travel trailer. So far, the RV 795 has only directed me on roads where a trailer can safely be towed.You need a lot of information about your trailer and tow vehicle to set this up but the information is readily available online. You'll need to know the width, height, and weight of your trailer, the weight and length of your tow vehicle, and the total length of the trailer and tow vehicle. You can create profiles for multiple vehicles & combinations so it's easy to switch from towing a trailer to tow vehicle only.The user interface takes a little getting used to but it's not terribly difficult. By default you cannot enter or change destination or settings while moving. That is good for the driver (eyes on the road, please!) but you can disable that so the passenger can make updates while the vehicle is in motion.I used the enclosed suction cup to mount the RV 795 on my windshield just below the rearview mirror. I haven't had a problem with the device attached to the mount but I remove and hide it when parked and twice the mount fell off of the windshield. Only seems to happen when the RV 795 is not on the mount.The Garmin makes it easy to find gas stations. It lists (most of) them in order of distance. The one thing to watch for is that the Garmin cannot tell you if a particular station has the space needed when towing a longer trailer. Best to follow the old rule of thumb when towing: start looking for a gas station when you get to half a tank. That will give you some slack if getting to, into, or out of the nearest gas station would be too difficult.It also has a long list of Campgrounds, State Parks, and RV parks. Updating the info is easy although it can be a bit cumbersome. It updates over wifi. If you have a hotspot on your phone you can use that but it might take quite a while. It works well with home wifi IF you have a way to power the RV 795. I used a ham radio power supply with a cigarette lighter plug like the one that powers the RV 795 while traveling. It would be nice if Garmin sold a power supply specifically for use at home with their GPS systems.The RV 795 give you a lot of information while you are traveling. In addition to directions, it will track your speed vs. the posted limit. Good for people with a lead foot! It also warns about upcoming sharp bends in the road. In my experience it was overly cautious about \"sharp bend\" warnings but I prefer that to being surprised.  There are many other features such as satellite imagery that I've just begun to experiment with.Overall, this is a very useful aid for traveling in a recreational vehicle, especially if you are towing.",

        "review": "Overall, I am extremely pleased. I have used RV-specific GPSs from Garmin for quite a few years, so this one continues the line of very good usability for an RV. This is larger than my previous models, and that makes it easier to see in my motorhome. It connects well with my iPhone, which adds to its functionality. There are just a couple of \u201cheads up\u201d for a perspective buyer, neither of which is a stopper. First, even with my years of Garmin experience, there was still a pretty steep learning curve. Even after a few trips, I have to think about how to get the device to do what I want. That will come, but don\u2019t expect to take it out of the box and have it feel as comfortable as as an old pair of slippers, Second, it is Android based, which means a few features are not available on Mac operating systems. Just one example, with my Mac, I can\u2019t look inside the 895 and see the file structure and just add new items to the appropriate folder. If you have a Windows-based computer, that should be no problem. For me in the Mac world, it\u2019s not a real problem. I just use WiFi to send routes or waypoints to the 895. I only mention it because when I first got mine, it threw me for a bit of a loop not being able to get to the files on the 895 until Garmin support told me about the Android base, and the resulting limitations for Mac. No biggie. There is, as I said, an easy work-around, but I wanted other Mac users to know about this little quirk. Even with all of this, I am very glad I bought this and I recommended it to my son, who also drives an RV.",

        "review": "This Garmin has a large, beautiful screen, and because of its size, it is very easy to touch and move the map while driving. However I did find I had trouble finding a suitable location to mount it using the supplied suction cup mount. For your reference, I placed this in a class B Sprinter RV and ended up using the most forward location on the driver side door, in such a way as to not block my side view mirrors. It just barely worked. Barely.  As you can imagine, opening the drivers' door was now limited to the range of the power cable which I had connected above and behind the drivers' seat (routed along the top of the door, through the grab handle, and into a cigarette outlet above and behind my seat.)Pros:*Large screen, good audio volume for directions (Garmin was about 20\"/ 51cm away from my head).*I really appreciated the customization for the vehicle height, weight, length, and width.  We avoided all routes with low clearance bridges!!*The magnetic/charging suction cup mount was sturdy and held the unit firmly in place.* Easy sharing of GPX files over WiFi:  I planned a route on an iPad using the InRoute app (which also has vehicle size customization), and was able to send over the GPX file to the Garmin very easily when I had Wifi service. The route stored in the \"Route Planner\" tab is easy to find and select for navigating.*The ability to add all sorts of map information along the route: Fuel, \"trendy places\", campgrounds, places to stay, eat, etc.Cons:*The size of the Garmin itself! The entire body measures 11\" / 28cm diagonal.*Those of you new to Garmin products, as I am, may find the learning curve for inputting info a little less than intuitive.*Complete user manual is online.*Cost.If you have enough space for a dash mount -without blocking your view out the windshield- this may be the unit for you.  Personally, I will be returning this and selecting a smaller unit which still allows for setting vehicle height etc, parameters.Safe travels!",

        "review": "A few native feature improvements over the Zumo XT.  Gas prices, shared friend location, and some GUI updates.  But the best feature is Android phone software that actually works.  Tread is a huge improvement over the orphaned Zumo XT Drive app, that offer very little.It's a very nice touch that it will function off the old Zumo XT powered mount.  For the price it really should come with a protective case, like the old 880 did.  The XT2 processing actually feels slightly slower than the XT, but not by a lot.  I suspect the OS has some hidden improvements, because it now seems to have threads or multi-task.  Imagine my surprise when it provided voice navigation for the current route, while calculating an entirely new route.  My XT never did that.This unit was purchased for my wife's bike.  I used it on a 2 week tour, with my XT mount.  It was a little nice, but not enough to purchase a 2nd unit.  The main benefit of having two XT2 units would be to share our locations.  When touring we are normally riding together, so that's not a huge feature.At this time I would NOT buy a Garmin Zumo XT (original version).  The XT Drive software is horrible and they claim it doesn't work with Explore, because it's built in and not necessary on the Zumo XT.  Making the Zumo XT a very ignored model in Garmins lineup.  They REALLY should add support for the Zumo XT in Tread, just to provide decent software for those who've suffered through the Zumo XT for all these years!",

        "review": "I have used this rangefinder for about 10 rounds on a few different courses. I\u2019ve used other rangefinders and recently have been using GPS software on my phone. I never enjoyed using my phone on the course due to the distraction.This device is just fun to use. There is a slight delay for the device to wake up, but it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. I end up using the GPS functionality even more than the laser. They\u2019ve done an amazing job with the software UI to give you a ton of information very quickly. I do wish there was a shortcut to get to the score card quickly.The pin finder function is surprisingly useful (pro tip, don\u2019t wear a hat with a magnetic ball marker). One drawback is that you can\u2019t use a magnet attachment with this rangefinder due to the compass. I use a bag with a magnet flap and that doesn\u2019t seem to bother it.The laser is very accurate and grabs the flag quickly. The overlay of the ranged distance on the hole overview is just awesome. I end up playing a lot of evenings. One benefit of this device is makes the flag easy to see even when getting dark. It amplifies the ambient light and makes it easy to see.The battery life is probably the only drawback. I usually need to charge about every other round. I keep a backup battery in my bag so even if I forget to charge, I can plug in while getting ready. It actually charges very quickly.The connection to the phone works great and very cool how the score updates from the rangefinder into the Garmin golf app.In summary, this is a premium device at a premium price. At first I struggled with the idea of spending $500+ on a rangefinder, but very glad I did.",

        "review": "I was divided between this, and the ultra reliable Bushnell X2.  Trusted reliability plus a battery that will last a year or more were powerful arguments for the X2, but the built in GPS feature with downloaded courses on the Garmin were too tempting to pass on.  I\u2019m glad I bought the Garmin.  I played at a really challenging course with crazy elevation changes, and felt like I was cheating with this thing.  Blind areas aren\u2019t a concern when you get a graphic on your viewfinder showing where every hazard is.  The pinseeker mode was a lifesaver.  With elevation drops of over 100 ft, the \u201cplays like\u201d mode really helped me choose the right club.  Also, the oled screen is very sharp, and as just a rangefinder, it\u2019s ridiculously accurate.For the record, I originally bought the older z80 version and had to factory reset it 3 times in the first week just to get it to work, so I returned it. That made me nervous to buy this, but I\u2019m a bells and whistles guy, so I took the risk and I\u2019m glad. It has a video game like feel to the controls, and it takes a little playing around with to get it down.The downside is that after playing 18 holes, using frequently, I\u2019m at 68% battery, so I\u2019ll probably ending up charging this after 2 rounds of play to be safe.  It charges via USB, so if you have a cart with a USB slot, you can prevent it from draining.One final downside, I wish this thing had a magnet for the frame of the golf cart, or ability to clip onto my pants. The carrying case has a clip, but I don\u2019t like having to put it in and out of its case every hole.",

        "review": "Have to say that I impulse-purchased the Approach Z82 after seeing an ad from Garmin themselves on Facebook.  I\u2019ve used it for seven rounds.  For the purpose of comparing: I\u2019ve had a Leupold GX-4i3 and, most recently, a Bushnell Tour V4 Shift in my range-finding golf career.The accuracy of this rangefinder is just as good as both of my past owns. There is no worry there.  Targeting the flag can be a bit cumbersome for first-time users, but you will definitely get the hang of it, even without a steady hand.  It has the vibration technology just like most others with this feature.  It is roughly the same size and still ergonomically-friendly.  My favorite feature is what the embedded GPS helps bring to the front: the laser range arc.  After you input some of your standard yardages, this feature will ensure that you never second-guess yourself when wanting to clear ponds, fescue, anything.  The automatic switch to green view when you are shooting to the pin as you approach is also really neat - complete with front- and back-of-green yardages.Think that bunker is within driving distance for you? It might not be after you use the hazard view and literally scroll bunker-by-bunker on the hole you\u2019re playing!My only negatives are probably the same as what you might have read elsewhere:1) it is not easy to keep taking it out of its carrying case and putting it back in.  You almost have to leave it out.  However, the case is definitely solid and protective, so that\u2019s the good thing about it.2) you really have to practice going thru all of the copious menu options this thing has BEFORE you play.  And do it many times.  I only did it once.  You\u2019ll hold up your playing partners if you\u2019re not prepared.  But...be prepared to be blown away by what the Z82 can do.3) There is no easy way that I\u2019ve found to resume your round if you accidentally power it down while entering your scorecard (yes, you can do that right on this thing too!!).4) price. Personally I feel it is worth it, having sold my other two to cover the cost. But if you can pull the trigger, you won\u2019t be sorry.This really is a five-star product in my opinion.  If it comes down under $500 and if Garmin can provide a case that makes for easy removal and return, I will move this to five stars.I\u2019m still having a lot of fun with it and am ready for a hot day on the course tomorrow!",

The product produced an error when I attempted to register with Garmin, and as a result, no updates to the product software or maps are available.After exhausting all attempts to register this replacement, with the error resulting, I contacted Garmin both via online chat and phone.

The only explanation I was given was that purchasers of the \u201cRenewed Drive 53 with Traffic\u201d from the same source probably have not attempted register or update the device or maps.This issue has significantly impacted my customer experience, and I do not recommend this offered item for purchase. This is not an out-of-the-box user friendly and straight forward item and does not perform as expected.",

It requires a phone or a tablet with cellular location services. So not any tablet will do. The problem with using it on the phone is when you take phone out of the truck and the bluetooth connection with the device breaks, the software starts to scream \"malfunction, malfunction\". Hard to get rid of these pesky malfunction messages. I switched to Samsung galaxy tab with data plan from ATT. The software prompts you to do regular backups, otherwise malfunction warnings start to pop up. There is no mobile support chat, I was able to access the support chat only from PC. The manual is murky, I had to chat a few times with support just to understand some points. There are a few tricks with this device and the software, that you have to figure out by yourself.  Not sure if the sleep berth split, which is allowed in paper logs, will work with this software. Did not try out of fear it will reset the sleep hours.Mounting the device on my Volvo 780 was tricky. First, it requires adapter, which is hard to find. You have to make some kind of harness so it will not fall off or disconnect when driving. I made a flange and bolted it to a dash, so it's well secured.",

Actually, SW, GW and PW it calculated distance out a bit longer than reality.Mid irons was pretty much spot on.Where it suffered the most was long clubs like Driver & 3W.. and a little bit with other longer clubs - but not as bad as the driver.Was having to swing like a gorilla to get 225 at best.  So not sure if it was just a bad unit or not, but was not getting the right feedback from the support team.  Ball speed on the 225 was at 140 mph.  Which is really not possible.  And yes, there are many other factors too, but when you take into account a 10 degree launch angle - most all other factors still don't equate to 225 total distance.One really positive note - never missed a ball I hit with the 3 camera system.  Was very solid there.When I intentionally wants to go left to right or right to left, it picked that up well too.  Shanks to fat, etc..  all pretty solid.Has a camera system that allows you to play this back on the screen so you can see the ball impact from the club.This is a sticker system, them you get stickers to put on the top middle of each club to help with club head speed.One really solid feature is that you do NOT need a computer in order to hook this up to a projector - comes with it's own HDMI port.This product has a LOT of promise!  It's kinda a one of a kind product in the space right now.  You'll see a lot of GREAT reviews of it.  And I'm sure most of them are solid/legit reviews.  But I had to report my frustration and findings just to be fair.  After all, if you want to play golf using the Garmin Golf SUBSCRIPTION plan you need to get (99 a year or around 20 bucks a month) you want to be able to get off the tee further than 200 to 225 yards or otherwise you're in for a very long day.Btw, one other thing I did not like was the resolution and the practice round treatment.  I want a launch monitor that shows a crisp clean ball flight away from the ground up and this did not give me that.  It really should be much higher resolution.Now the amount of data points you get is very impressive.  Along with the camera view of ball impact, as well, this picks up all ball contacts and even putting - yes, putting works here too.Btw, Home Tee Hero (Garmin Subscription Required and you get over 43k of courses) you don't put, you have two circles one that covers the outside of the green which is you hit in that you get 2 strokes putting (gimme) and a smaller circle that gets you 1 stroke putting (gimme).",

The numbers on the R10 are typical to what I see on the driving range and course. The crazy thing is that the R50 is picking up the same ball speed and launch angles. I think part of the problem is that it has way too much of a draw basis. Until Garmin figures out their software it just isn't usable.",

        "review": "If you are reading this, then you are probably going through all of the smart watch/fitness watch/adventure watch options and getting dizzy.  That was me.  After weeks of research, I was down to the Venu 2+ and the Instinct 2 Solar.  And then this Venu 2 (non-plus) went on sale during Prime Day.Moving from a Fitbit Charge 4, the Venu 2, Venu 2+, or Instinct 2 Solar would have given me more features, but I was hung up on what the Venu2+ (phone call functionality) and Instinct 2 Solar (infinite battery life) offered that this plain Venu 2 didn't.  However, at the Prime Day price, I could not pass it up.  Now, after owning this watch for a few months, I have forgotten most of what those watches offered above the Venu 2.I primarily run, hike, and play golf with the occasional bike ride or other activity thrown in.  Though I do at least one of those activities 4-5 days a week, I am not a serious participant in any of them and so the truly high end features are not needed.  For what I do, the Venu does it all (well, very nearly all) and does it well.  And, it looks good doing it.  Taking my three primary activities, I'll give you my take:1.  Running.  I was looking for a watch to use while training for a set of races.  Data screens are nicely configurable and I was able to pair it with my foot pod (for treadmill) and, in the end, managed to beat my race goal time significantly.  The watch is easy to see even in the brightest sunshine and the display is crystal clear.  It's also easy to configure and navigate through and the choice of watchfaces is infinite. There were only two things that I would have liked but didn't have regarding running:  There is no virtual pace partner (my old Forerunner 620 had that) and you can't send PacePro Pacing Strategies to the Venu 2.  Neither of these are critical, but if I had to add two features, those would be it.  Not specific to this watch, the Garmin Connect app and the training programs offered through it are fantastic.  Music controls are easy to use, too, and it holds plenty of tracks.Hiking.  The GPS tracking is very accurate and for casual hiking (which is all I do) there is nothing lacking.  Though it does gather elevation info, it does not have the pro hiking features found on Instinct 2, Fenix, etc.  Not a problem for me.Golf.  Now this was my most pleasant surprise.  I had a Garmin Approach watch already and I loved it.  Notice that the previous sentence was in the past tense.  Yeah, I don't use my Approach any more.  The Venu 2 works great as a golf watch and is easier to use.  The only slight negative is that you have to download the courses manually rather than having them all populated in the Approach.  You also have a limited amount of memory available, so you can only download a half dozen or so courses at once.  Otherwise, I love it for golf.  It will even track your shots as you play giving you distance and direction info for each.  I now know that I have been lying about how long I hit my driver and kidding myself that I don't have a slice.  Note that my Approach watch is not an S60 or S62, so doesn't have the most advanced features those have, but, again, I don't need those things as data overload would only make the rounds even longer.As for other things, I really enjoy:Beautiful OLED displayWatch face customizations for both looks and functionalitySleep tracking (Garmin is brutal about your sleep)Stress trackingBody battery is a great and accurate indicator of how much energy you have leftPhone finder (use it all the time)Fall detection (luckily haven't needed it, yet).Battery life if you don't use GPS is nearly 2 weeks.Syncs flawlessly with my phone, tablet, or computer.Spot on heart rate monitor.Things that could be better:The tracking of elevation without GPS is pretty bad.Bezel is a little rough.Some better apps for navigation would be nice.Tracking of nontraditional movement does not always work ( e.g. using a push mower you don't get steps because your arm doesn't swing).Native support for YouTube Music is unavailable(though there is an app to give you most functionality)Garmin makes literally dozens of different active watches and the Venu 2 is one of them.  That meaningless statement is meant to say that you just need to decide on the features you need and the price you are willing to pay, and Garmin will have a watch for you.  The Venu 2 line of watches are in that area between a fitness watch and a smart watch with some of the best features of both...and you don't have to charge it every 2 days like the true smart watches.It's been funny to see Apple advertising \"new\" features for the latest Apple Watch.  These are features that have been on Garmin watches for years.  I know Apple has its eye on Garmin's market and through their cult-like following will undoubtedly take some share, but as long as Garming keeps innovating, they are going to be among the best watches with the most choices anywhere.",

        "review": "After much research, I decided on the Garmin Venu 2 for several reasons:1) Battery Life: I knew that if I had to charge my watch every day, I just wouldn't use it.  This model's batter does not last as long between charged (6-10 days I find, based on my use type) as some of other Garmin watches, but it works for me (can go on short trips without bringing cable).2) Access to data/software: I wanted a clean, clear useful data set and presentation.  Also, it infuriated me that most other trackers now charge you for access (usually $10 month).  Garmin's software is clean looking, clear and helpful...and they do not charge for access!3) Utility: I found the combination of touch screen + buttons made the most sense for me, so that when in the middle of an activity you can easily utilize the buttons on the watch to select features.4) Aesthetics: Least important, but still relevant...I wanted a watch/tracker that looked like a classic watch, and not a squarish piece of tech on my wrist.I have been extremely happy with this watch/tracker!  I love the data (sleep, the great mapping & results from activities like biking, running, etc).  I found the data is presented in a clear, inviting way with recommendations for things like how to achieve better sleep, etc.  The fact that Garmin doesn't milk you another $10 a month or more for this is a big deal (philosophically if nothing else).Finally, unfortunately my Venu 2 did recently stop working.  However, I went online to customer support (on a holiday) and had the best experience I have ever had.  I was immediately picked-up by chat support, guided through a few steps to see if could revive, and then immediately sent a form to send the device back for a replacement.  They didn't put me through the usual laundry list of questions (serial number, purchase details, etc).  Absolutely the best CX experience I have ever had, and I received my new replacement watch quickly (and am so happy to have it back).  I would strongly recommend Garmin activity trackers/watchers, as having owned most other brands, they clearly are just better than the rest for my needs/requirements.",

I had picked this(2nd best) over Garmin's Fenix 8 (Their top watch), due to me not really wanting to pay a little extra for the extra features such as the Solar Charging or Longer battery life, because I don't mind charging my watch ever so often and I am not outside THAT much for it to make a difference. At least 2 hours at most for my training. The watch will last me a long enough (~10 to 14days) without charging and I am happy with that versus me having to charge my Samsung watch like 1.5x a day which was getting annoying. The quality of the watch is amazing, the Glass is supposed to be stronger than the Gorilla kind and the material of the bezel makes it look so premium. The charging speed is also pretty good, I don't realize how fast it charges but I know it's quick (~1hr) from 0 to 100.The sensors it has seems pretty good and capable of tracking my daily results. It is keeping me in shape. Overall I recommend for the runners or just anyone who likes to keep track of things or a good, lasting watch!",

(15 days without AOD.)The AMOLED display looks great indoors in medium-to-bright light, and outdoors if it's overcast. In active mode, it's okay-not-great in bright sunlight. Both active and AOD can be a bit too bright in the dark. The one real fault here is that the AOD practically disappears in bright sunlight.The touchscreen is extremely overly sensitive at times. A slight accidental brush of the screen with my sleeve can start rearranging my glance widgets! Sometimes it's so hypersensitive I just have to disable the touch screen for a bit. Everything is fine with the touch screen disabled. This is the biggest flaw, and I hope it can be fixed with software updates. I used the Enduro 3 for a few weeks and its touch screen was just fine, not hyperactive like the 970.Aside from the glitchy touch screen and the AOD that's invisible in bright sunlight, I like the 970 and am keeping it. In some ways I like the Enduro 3 better, but it's just too big for comfort. The comfortable 970 wins.",

I loved it - for 1 day.  Then I immediately realized I needed something newer and more to really get the most out of the potential for all of the apps  The 55 is: too dim, needs the backlight on or activated all the time, battery lasted like, 4 days running with display, running breathing apps, etc. it has small fonts and icons that make it hard to see, (like the watch hands overlap the heart rate if you have that screen enabled - the overall diameter of the screen is just too small), and limited extra apps that the newer Garmin fleet has and diminished functionality of parallel apps.I returned with the 90 day refund policy and upgraded to the 165.  Now I really, really love what I've got.My opinion if it helps: if you are strapped and can only get the 55, get it. But, trust me, you will return it and get at least a 165 if you have the extra $120 (ish).  I debated over getting the 255, but, after reading the reviews (Tom's) and looking at the screen shots, really, if you are used to a smart phone at all, you will want the 165 with the AMOLED over the MIP of the 55 and 255.  The touch screen on the 165 also makes navigating through the deeper menus much easier as does turning on the display if the accelerometer doesn't activate it as needed. Of course any model higher is going to rock and roll.  I don't mind the mix of hard buttons and screen swipes.  I think it's a good combo.Too early to comment on battery life, but, so far, I like the watch enough, I honestly don't care if I can get 3 days out of it.

        "review": "A few native feature improvements over the Zumo XT.  Gas prices, shared friend location, and some GUI updates.  But the best feature is Android phone software that actually works.  Tread is a huge improvement over the orphaned Zumo XT Drive app, that offer very little.It's a very nice touch that it will function off the old Zumo XT powered mount.  For the price it really should come with a protective case, like the old 880 did.  The XT2 processing actually feels slightly slower than the XT, but not by a lot.  I suspect the OS has some hidden improvements, because it now seems to have threads or multi-task.  Imagine my surprise when it provided voice navigation for the current route, while calculating an entirely new route.  My XT never did that.This unit was purchased for my wife's bike.  I used it on a 2 week tour, with my XT mount.  It was a little nice, but not enough to purchase a 2nd unit.  The main benefit of having two XT2 units would be to share our locations.  When touring we are normally riding together, so that's not a huge feature.At this time I would NOT buy a Garmin Zumo XT (original version).  The XT Drive software is horrible and they claim it doesn't work with Explore, because it's built in and not necessary on the Zumo XT.  Making the Zumo XT a very ignored model in Garmins lineup.  They REALLY should add support for the Zumo XT in Tread, just to provide decent software for those who've suffered through the Zumo XT for all these years!",

Actually, SW, GW and PW it calculated distance out a bit longer than reality.Mid irons was pretty much spot on.Where it suffered the most was long clubs like Driver & 3W.. and a little bit with other longer clubs - but not as bad as the driver.Was having to swing like a gorilla to get 225 at best.  So not sure if it was just a bad unit or not, but was not getting the right feedback from the support team.  Ball speed on the 225 was at 140 mph.  Which is really not possible.  And yes, there are many other factors too, but when you take into account a 10 degree launch angle - most all other factors still don't equate to 225 total distance.One really positive note - never missed a ball I hit with the 3 camera system.  Was very solid there.When I intentionally wants to go left to right or right to left, it picked that up well too.  Shanks to fat, etc..  all pretty solid.Has a camera system that allows you to play this back on the screen so you can see the ball impact from the club.This is a sticker system, them you get stickers to put on the top middle of each club to help with club head speed.One really solid feature is that you do NOT need a computer in order to hook this up to a projector - comes with it's own HDMI port.This product has a LOT of promise!  It's kinda a one of a kind product in the space right now.  You'll see a lot of GREAT reviews of it.  And I'm sure most of them are solid/legit reviews.  But I had to report my frustration and findings just to be fair.  After all, if you want to play golf using the Garmin Golf SUBSCRIPTION plan you need to get (99 a year or around 20 bucks a month) you want to be able to get off the tee further than 200 to 225 yards or otherwise you're in for a very long day.Btw, one other thing I did not like was the resolution and the practice round treatment.  I want a launch monitor that shows a crisp clean ball flight away from the ground up and this did not give me that.  It really should be much higher resolution.Now the amount of data points you get is very impressive.  Along with the camera view of ball impact, as well, this picks up all ball contacts and even putting - yes, putting works here too.Btw, Home Tee Hero (Garmin Subscription Required and you get over 43k of courses) you don't put, you have two circles one that covers the outside of the green which is you hit in that you get 2 strokes putting (gimme) and a smaller circle that gets you 1 stroke putting (gimme).",

The numbers on the R10 are typical to what I see on the driving range and course. The crazy thing is that the R50 is picking up the same ball speed and launch angles.

It's my third Garmin in ten+ years, so the learning curve was probably a bit easier for me, but I absolutely love it. We hit a lot of State and National Parks in WV, VA and PA and it worked liked a charm. Just a few navigational issues here and there, but that's the map -- not the device. We drove through the western, then the eastern sides, of the states we passed through from Tampa, FL to WVA. Was a great help in finding gas, food and lodging. Not to mention, obscures locations for some of the water falls we were seeking. I highly recommend it. Refurbished or new.I was not able to get the mobile app to work, but I also had very little time to work with it before we. left. It was a last minute purchase when I found that my older GPS system was not syncing well with my newer (different platform) computer.

But after having probably 6 Garmin car GPSs over maybe 20 years (and really liking them) I'm starting to get really irritated with the company. Can they finally make Garmin Express user friendly? I just bought a new device and tried to download European maps to it as well as transfer favorites in Europe to the new device. I figured downloading the maps would be pretty easy. After 6 hours of trying, on both a MAC and PC, driving all the way to Best Buy to get a micro SD card. I still have not been able to get it up and running. I'm having to learn along the way, that 1, I need an SD card because Garmin doesn't want to put big enough ssds in their units to download extra maps. 2. At Best Buy I bought a 256GB card because Garmin doesn't let you know how big the map will be, in fact they don't really tell you are going to HAVE to buy micro SD card if you want to download any maps. After buying the 256GB card (Garmin recommends 7GB to 256GB) I found the newest Garmin Smart Drive only accepts 32GB ( you have to research this when I discovered my SD card was incompatible. It does not tell you WHY it is, just that it is leaving you to start Googling why your new sandisk doesn't work.3) My PC would only sometimes recognize my new Device after I paid the 99$ (overpriced) for the Euro maps. Only to find that I got stuck in a \"preparing device for download. It should take a minute\" After an hour I pretty much decided something was wrong. I tried it again and again before starting all over on my MAC. I got it to recognize it after logging into my account and downloading Garmin Express to my MAC. Seemed to work better but even while logged in, the map I had paid for was not showing up. So I had to buy another version (99$) (I'm doubting Garmin will reimbursee me for the other one - but at this point I need this thing set up for my trip and I don't have time to wait over the 3 day holiday for Garmin tech support to help me. Then I was able to get buy the \"preparing device for download\" only to find I NEEDED a SD card for more disk space. Went to Best Buy, bought the 256 SD micro SD card, drove home and found 256 was too big, even somewhere it says 7-256 GB okay. Then found for my unit I need 32GB only. Ordered 2 from Amazon (I don't think Best Buy had micro SD cards as small as 32GB). So now I am waiting on one of those. I bought 2 brands in case Garmin doesn't like one of them.Also, this new unit seems to now have 2 things you have to agree to every time you turn it on. Which is incredibly annoying. The first is an End User License Agreement which you have to accept each and every time yo turn on the device. followed by a WARNING screen which you then have to agree to also.  I'm hoping after I've signed the End License Agreement 20 times, I no longer will have to. But I doubt it. And this is how the annoying agreement starts.\"As an eco-conscious technology leader, Garmin presents these End User License Agreements electronically\", First shut up Garmin with the virtue signaling. Second, huh? So I have to agree to this, whatever it is, I don't know because it looks like its about 10,000 words and I'm not going to read it, EVERY time I turn on the device because you want to not put a slip of paper with the agreement on it in the box? Is that what you are saying? That doesn't even make sense.Oh yeah, and by the way. The download Maps are 99$ and you can only use them on 1 device every. If you buy Map on a mini SD card and Garmin ships that to you, you can transfer it to other devices.. and it costs 99$ as well. Garmin seems to want you to buy the mini SD card over the download. Hey, Garmin, would it not be more eco friendly, if I could just download the map to the device instead and be able to t deactivate and reactivate it to a new device later? instead of all the non eco friendly shipping materials being used to send out micro SD cards  all over the world that most people will buy because they can be used on multiple devices for years to come? 99 dollars (plus 15$ micro SD card) for 1 device only if you download or 99 dollars for a shipped SD card that can be used on multiple devices forever. Why are you making it make more sense for people to chose the non eco friendly way?I mean, you are a eco-conscious technology leader all...I really hope when these mico SD cards show up in 2 days, I can download the Euro maps, because I leave for Europe the next day.",

        "review": "I just received my new Garmin HRM-Dual heart rate monitor chest strap from Amazon today and took it directly to spin class at CYCLEBAR Columbia Pike. I love it! It\u2019s exactly what I needed.It supports dual Bluetooth signals and also ANT+. Now I don\u2019t need a series of Garmin 010 10997 00, Polar H7, and Scosche Rhythm+ straps to combine together to connect to the Concept2 PM5, the iPod Touch, the Garmin 920xt, and even the Keiser M3 and the Schwinn spin bikes at CYCLEBAR. Technically-speaking, the HRM-Dual transmits real-time heart rate data over ANT+ connectivity and dual BLUETOOTH Low Energy (LE) technologyThe new Garmin HRM-Dual heart rate monitor chest strap replaces them all. Don\u2019t pay attention to what DC Rainmaker says about this strap with regards to it being just bundle-fodder, this is the strap I have been waiting for. Yes, maybe the Wahoo TICKR through TICKRX are better value at the low end ($50) and offers more functionality like memory at the high end ($80); however, I will never use the Wahoo app nor will I ever need the memory feature. While the baseline TICKR does offer the same functionality at $20 less, it\u2019s no a Garmin, its battery lasts 1/3 as long, and what\u2019s $20 over the next decade that I\u2019ll probably be using it on all of my machines and devices.Other than that DC Rainmaker did an amazing review both on his site and on YouTube.I also prefer the electrical (ECG) heart rate monitors over optical (PPG) heart rate monitors. While they both work, I have deep veins and so sometimes the optical heart rate monitors are either delayed or they can get lost for a few seconds. While the ICG monitors, such as the HRM-Dual, require moisture to make a solid connection with the pulse and heart rate, I keep a tube of Spectra 360 Electrode Gel next to my Concept2, which seems to work.Yes, it is more expensive than the competition but the battery lasts 3.5 years and it\u2019s Garmin and when you think about it, if it replaces everything, even spin class, the rowing ergometer, the SkiErg, and my watches and bikes, then I\u2019m good to go.I had been using both a Polar H7 around my chest and a Scosche Rhythm+ optical heart rate monitor that I wore on my arm. The Polar H7 supports Bluetooth and the Scosche Rhythm+ supports ANT+.So, I\u2019m pretty psyched about it. It worked perfectly with my watch and my Schwinn Blue Carbon spin bike without a hiccup; however, the signal is pretty strong so my neighbor cyclist recorded my ANT+ signal on her monitor while she was riding as well. I mean, that doesn\u2019t matter much to me\u2014and most riders at CYCLEBAR don\u2019t seem to wear heart rate monitors\u2014so I\u2019ll see how it works out over time.I needed a heart rate monitor that tracked ANT+ and Bluetooth, preferably more than one channel of Bluetooth LE. I am always either on a Bluetooth-enabled device or on an ANT+ device. Often, like at Spin class, I needed both at once and wore two heart rate monitors: first, two chest straps (awful) and then a chest strap and an arm strap. That was OK but the arm strapped required nightly charging and I am not 100% sold on optical heart rate monitors for anything more than my activity tracker. So, when DC Rainmaker reviews the brand new electrical (not optical) heart rate strap that Garmin released, I ordered it right away. It wasn\u2019t even shipping yet. When it arrived, I brought it right to Spin class and it worked. The only down side, maybe, is that the signal for the Garmin HRM-Dual is strong enough that the machines around you might pick up your heart rate. Either the lady next to me at spin class and I were heart-rate synced or her Schwinn was also displaying my HR. But that\u2019s not a bad thing. I assume that if the person next to me had a strap, its closer proximity might override mine. Maybe?  One more possible downside is that the strap hooks with the same sort of bra-like hook and loop closure like the Polar H7 has, which can start to become less reliable as the strap gets older and a little more stretched out, instead of a proper clip or the sort of snap-button based attachments that the Wahoo TICKRs have (a nice feature) or the plastic clips, similar to what that old-timey-but-cheap Garmin 010 10997 00 heart rate monitors had.",

        "review": "I transitioned exclusively to Wahoo from Garmin years ago, and have been using Wahoo heart rate monitors with Bolt computers.The Wahoo heart rate monitors inevitably work perfectly for just over a year and then begin transmitting erratic readings.  Wahoo is good about replacing defective monitors, but I am honestly weary of using disposable monitors that cannot be repaired, don\u2019t allow the battery to be replaced, are unnecessarily wasteful by being disposable and nevertheless are double the price of other heart rate monitors available on Amazon.So I have switched back to a Garmin chest strap monitor with replaceable battery, but that also offers battery life before replacement of around 1,000 hours (compared to 30 hours on my latest Wahoo monitor).I haven\u2019t used a chest strap in years since the forearm strap monitors are so much more convenient.But the greater accuracy, the high build quality and the three years of use before needing to change an inexpensive 2032 battery\u2026..those things all matter more to me than the added convenience of a forearm strap.This Garmin monitor instantly connected to my Wahoo Bolt via ANT+, and provides a perfectly accurate and stable heart rate signal. It seems less subject to interference and more immediately responsive to heart rate changes related to terrain differences, pace differences etc.I honestly wonder why Wahoo and other electronic fitness component manufacturers use rechargeable batteries that cannot be replaced when a simple 2032 cell can power a device like this one for three years vs maybe three rides on a comparable rechargeable device.",

        "review": "I bought the Garmin RV 795 because I have a 24' travel trailer and Google Maps is notorious for misrouting travelers into tight spaces. On a few trips it routed me incorrectly into places that were difficult to get out of in my pickup truck alone and would have been a nightmare with a travel trailer. So far, the RV 795 has only directed me on roads where a trailer can safely be towed.You need a lot of information about your trailer and tow vehicle to set this up but the information is readily available online. You'll need to know the width, height, and weight of your trailer, the weight and length of your tow vehicle, and the total length of the trailer and tow vehicle. You can create profiles for multiple vehicles & combinations so it's easy to switch from towing a trailer to tow vehicle only.The user interface takes a little getting used to but it's not terribly difficult. By default you cannot enter or change destination or settings while moving. That is good for the driver (eyes on the road, please!) but you can disable that so the passenger can make updates while the vehicle is in motion.I used the enclosed suction cup to mount the RV 795 on my windshield just below the rearview mirror. I haven't had a problem with the device attached to the mount but I remove and hide it when parked and twice the mount fell off of the windshield. Only seems to happen when the RV 795 is not on the mount.The Garmin makes it easy to find gas stations. It lists (most of) them in order of distance. The one thing to watch for is that the Garmin cannot tell you if a particular station has the space needed when towing a longer trailer. Best to follow the old rule of thumb when towing: start looking for a gas station when you get to half a tank. That will give you some slack if getting to, into, or out of the nearest gas station would be too difficult.It also has a long list of Campgrounds, State Parks, and RV parks. Updating the info is easy although it can be a bit cumbersome. It updates over wifi. If you have a hotspot on your phone you can use that but it might take quite a while. It works well with home wifi IF you have a way to power the RV 795. I used a ham radio power supply with a cigarette lighter plug like the one that powers the RV 795 while traveling. It would be nice if Garmin sold a power supply specifically for use at home with their GPS systems.The RV 795 give you a lot of information while you are traveling. In addition to directions, it will track your speed vs. the posted limit. Good for people with a lead foot! It also warns about upcoming sharp bends in the road. In my experience it was overly cautious about \"sharp bend\" warnings but I prefer that to being surprised.  There are many other features such as satellite imagery that I've just begun to experiment with.Overall, this is a very useful aid for traveling in a recreational vehicle, especially if you are towing.",

        "review": "Overall, I am extremely pleased. I have used RV-specific GPSs from Garmin for quite a few years, so this one continues the line of very good usability for an RV. This is larger than my previous models, and that makes it easier to see in my motorhome. It connects well with my iPhone, which adds to its functionality. There are just a couple of \u201cheads up\u201d for a perspective buyer, neither of which is a stopper. First, even with my years of Garmin experience, there was still a pretty steep learning curve. Even after a few trips, I have to think about how to get the device to do what I want. That will come, but don\u2019t expect to take it out of the box and have it feel as comfortable as as an old pair of slippers, Second, it is Android based, which means a few features are not available on Mac operating systems. Just one example, with my Mac, I can\u2019t look inside the 895 and see the file structure and just add new items to the appropriate folder. If you have a Windows-based computer, that should be no problem. For me in the Mac world, it\u2019s not a real problem. I just use WiFi to send routes or waypoints to the 895. I only mention it because when I first got mine, it threw me for a bit of a loop not being able to get to the files on the 895 until Garmin support told me about the Android base, and the resulting limitations for Mac. No biggie. There is, as I said, an easy work-around, but I wanted other Mac users to know about this little quirk. Even with all of this, I am very glad I bought this and I recommended it to my son, who also drives an RV.",

However I did find I had trouble finding a suitable location to mount it using the supplied suction cup mount. For your reference, I placed this in a class B Sprinter RV and ended up using the most forward location on the driver side door, in such a way as to not block my side view mirrors. It just barely worked. Barely.  As you can imagine, opening the drivers' door was now limited to the range of the power cable which I had connected above and behind the drivers' seat (routed along the top of the door, through the grab handle, and into a cigarette outlet above and behind my seat.)Pros:*Large screen, good audio volume for directions (Garmin was about 20\"/ 51cm away from my head).*I really appreciated the customization for the vehicle height, weight, length, and width.  We avoided all routes with low clearance bridges!!*The magnetic/charging suction cup mount was sturdy and held the unit firmly in place.* Easy sharing of GPX files over WiFi:  I planned a route on an iPad using the InRoute app (which also has vehicle size customization), and was able to send over the GPX file to the Garmin very easily when I had Wifi service. The route stored in the \"Route Planner\" tab is easy to find and select for navigating.*The ability to add all sorts of map information along the route: Fuel, \"trendy places\", campgrounds, places to stay, eat, etc.Cons:*The size of the Garmin itself! The entire body measures 11\" / 28cm diagonal.*Those of you new to Garmin products, as I am, may find the learning curve for inputting info a little less than intuitive.*Complete user manual is online.*Cost.If you have enough space for a dash mount -without blocking your view out the windshield- this may be the unit for you.  Personally, I will be returning this and selecting a smaller unit which still allows for setting vehicle height etc, parameters.Safe travels!",

        "review": "Is it possible for a small, $10 purchase to be one of the best Amazon purchases I have ever made? In the case of these adaptors, the answer is yes. Background:1. I have had a Garmin Vivoactive watch for several years now. I really like the watch and don't need a new one. My only complaint (which evidently applies to lots of smart watches) is that fact that the charging ports require a proprietary plug, so a micro-USB or USB-C port is usually not an option.2. So for several years I have had to keep up with yet ANOTHER charging cord. I travel a lot so that adds to the hassle. On top of that, the plug ends often get slightly bent, and either require some unnecessary wiggling and maneuvering just to get the cord to fit, or it won't fit into my watch at all. And even when the plugs that aren't bent, they often don't secure very well, such that when it looks like the watch should be charging, it isn't (this has happened to me numerous times; I plug the watch in, come back an hour later and it is still dead).3. I just threw away a charging cord for not working well and I saw these adaptors on Amazon. I hoped that for $10 they would be useful.What an amazing product. They snap tightly onto the USB-C cord that most all of us have readily available everywhere. Even better, the end that plugs into the watch fits far more snugly and securely than any Garmin cord that I have owned before--it almost came as a revelation, as in \"you mean this watch always had the ability to be more securely connected and I am only discovering it now?\"I also appreciate the three pack, to include an angled version. In fact that is the one that is in the photo I have attached. This product is new to me, so perhaps there will be issues in the future.

The cable was getting pretty worn out and it would take multiple tries to get it to successfully connect to the watch. This adapter worked right off the bat and it's very affordable; you get adapters enough for three watches for less than the price of a single Garmin cable! Time will tell if these last but my husband is so happy about the performance and ease of use thus far!",

With the excellent battery life, I haven't needed to charge it more than every couple weeks.. but over time the factory charging cable got more finnicky.  Had to prop the watch just so with lateral force to get it to stay connected for charging.  It appears that one of the four spring loaded pins was not protruding as much as the others.  Perhaps it was bent a little.  These connectors are working great out of the box.  You actually have to push a little harder to seat it so the pins don't push it back out.  Seems the springs have more force and less stiction.  Hopefully this work for a long time so I can defer spending a grand on a newer Fexix model... because I really like my 6x!",

My only two nit-picks (not serious enough to rise to the level of complaints) are: 1) the range of adjustment isn't the greatest. I can barely get it tilted down to a point where the screen is vertical when mounted on a disk on the dash of a 2018 Honda CR-V; and 2) the suction cup mount will occasionally come loose and fall off the disk. This is likely an issue will all suction cup mounts no matter the manufacturer. To avoid this, I periodically remove the mount, clean the suction cup and the disk, dampen the suction cup, and remount it.",

        "review": "Leave It to Garmin!! This Garmin Suction Cup Mount is actually way better than the original as the suction force on my windshield is so strong I actually can't take it off my windshield!!! What happened is that last week the plastic lever used to tighten the suction cup mount to the windshield fell off of the assembly onto my center console. I carefully put in back into place however when I pushed it forward to tighten the Garmin unit to the windshield I noticed it had very little torque. (Like many other parts to various components once they break they have to be replaced) Anyway, now.. The torque is so tight that even when I release the lever to take off the suction cup mount I can't  remove it!! If I tried any harder I'd break the plastic on this replacement unit. (I usually remove the Garmin from my windshield at night as previously the entire unit/suction cup mount and the Garmin itself were falling onto my center console due to excessive heat build up on the windshield in the morning) Not anymore!! Now, I simply take off the Garmin and put it in my center console storage compartment and leave the suction cup mount on the windshield.. In the morning I take out the Garmin and attach it onto the plastic ball and that's that!! So actually, this unit is much stronger, has way more torque than the suction cup mount that came with the unit. My advice is to actually invest the $11 and buy this Garmin Suction Cup Mount when you buy a Garmin navigation unit as it's way more tight and durable. (keep the suction cup mount that comes with the Garmin as a backup)  By the way, this replacement unit fits my Garmin perfectly. Many have asked (In the Amazon Forum) if the replacement unit will fit the Garmin needing the part so.. have no worries it'll fit basically any Garmin perfectly!! Thank You Amazon for keeping these replacement parts in stock and many thanks to Garmin for manufacturing the replacement parts that naturally need to be replaced over time. I couldn't be happier with this replacement Garmin Suction Cup Mount!! Don't hesitate for a moment to purchase it.. As already noted, it's actually better than the one that came with the unit! Amazing!!",

I do a lot of advanced driving in my job high speeds, fast turns, sudden stops.  I don't remove it form my windshield at all.

I found it very convenient and easy to use while it lasted, but the plastic hinge (that tilts the unit up and down) broke too easily rendering the unit useless.  As a mechanical engineer I feel qualified to say I believe the mechanism is poorly designed and too fragile. I did buy a replacement as it sticks to the windshield well, is very compact, and is very convenient, but I will definitely be more careful when handling it in the future. Note: I have also used the \"bean bag\" type dash mount.  By comparison, the bean bag works well, but the additional bulk and weight makes it less convenient when traveling. I primarily use it in areas where windshield mounts are illegal (like California).  Both units allow you to plug the charging cord into the holder or directly into the unit.",

        "review": "By far the best Chronograph on the market! It checks every box for ease of use, convenience, and accuracy. Its truly above all others. I can make this statement against my experience owning just about every chronograph out there. Using them weekly checking handgun velocity to meet power factor requirements in competition. Most were dual optical sensor types that work but are inherently finicky requiring timely setup with deflectors, wires, or lighting kits depending on conditions. I also owned one other radar type prior to this one that again worked but was also finicky and took up a lot of space on the bench. The Garmin Xero solves all those issues. Its the easy button of chronographs.  The very nature of radar eliminates the need for specific lighting conditions, use it on sunny days, overcast days, indoors, or at night without any special setups, just use it as is. The Garmin is triggered when it detects a moving object crossing through its emitted radar. It does not utilize an audible trigger to detect and read shots like other radars on the market. That means no errors from unintended triggering from nearby shooters firing (no compromised data from unread triggers). Its setup is as easy as it gets. When you power it up you navigate through a simple and quick start up choosing the usage, handgun, rifle or bow. It will show you a setup position diagram to place it correctly. Its small size is not cumbersome when working around it on a bench. Its not a wall tile towering around to wobble or get incidentally knocked off target. Aiming does not require an aperture sight to get it precisely aligned to your target for proper pickup of shots. Simply just square up the unit by eye in the intended shot line and it will read your shots no problem. I've used this unit regularly for a month to check all my previous data from other units. It has worked flawless and picked up every shot without a single error. The Bluetooth to send data to the free phone app works great. No connection drop issues and data uploads to your app automatically when you \"end the session\" every time. The internal battery lasts for a whole day of shooting. Unit will shut off the emitted radar if it doesn't detect activity after aprox. 15 minutes to prolong battery life. I can say without a doubt this is the best Chronograph on the market in every way. Yes, its expensive, but its worth every penny  considering the dependability and convenience you'll get. Its a complete pleasure to use and never a point of aggravation to ruin a nice day at the range.",

It captures the shots, it\u2019s accurate, it\u2019s compact, no need to set up a bunch of poles, magneto rods, sunshades, a bunch of wires all over the place, none of that stuff. You turn this on, synch it with the app on your phone, and it stores your shots.  It\u2019s a great, simple, easy to use chrono that you set up near the muzzle.  You may have to move it around, but the instructions are simple. Get it, set it, shoot.  It\u2019s that easy!  I love mine, and I\u2019m so glad I got it. I had the Caldwell, and I always had problems with it. This thing is awesome. It makes tracking my load data so easy, and it\u2019s simplified my process for developing my load data. They really hit a home run with this chronograph. If you\u2019re on the fence, then go for it!You too will wait until everyone\u2019s gone to bed and you\u2019ll hold it and admire it, and then the wife comes downstairs and finds you caressing it and secretly writing poetry about it, buying it flowers, sharing all your secrets with it, kinda like when you got that shiny 1911.  You know it\u2019s true, real men of genius. Joking aside, it really is a great chrono.  Take care everyone!!",

        "review": "I hesitated buy the Garmin Xero C1 Pro because of the price.  It seems way too expensive to get me the velocity information I needed.  There are cheaper alternatives and most are of the same old technology as my old Chrony where it reads the bullet (shadow) passing by in order to determine velocity which comes with all sorts of inherent issues such as shade, clouds, muzzle gasses, etc. all resulting in bad readings or errors.  Never mind the risk of shooting your chronograph that is down range from the rifle.So I read a bunch of reviews on the Garmin and decided to give it a reluctant try.  POOF and $640 was gone, but I had my new chronograph and it is TINY.  It is small than the size of my old display unit for my deceased Chrony.  After I got it out of the box, on the charger, and turned on for the first time, I did the initial setup (things like picking English as a language and fps instead of mps, etc.) and waited for it to fully charge.I did not read any instructions.I got it to the range, put it on its little tripod and set it up next to the rifle like I saw in other reviews (I now know it needs to be fairly close to the muzzle), turned it on, selected to start a new session, and started shooting.  It read each shot fired with no dropped shots and no errors.  When I would change to a different load, I would start a new session.  I was able to get the data I needed very quickly and then be on my way to hunt.  ZERO problems were encountered.I have not used the app, though I did download it.  I am not sure what all the app will do, but will explore that in the future.  The unit does not require use of the app (which was a concern I had) to get your basic shooting data (see screen display images.  The first shows the display after a shot and the 2nd shows the summer of the shots for the given load.If you are going to pay a premium price for a bit of kit, you want that bit of kit to be hassle-free and in my experience so far, the Garmin Xero C1 Pro has been hassle free and not only that, soooo much easier to use than my old chronograph.  Setup and breakdown are literally only seconds.  I would spend several minutes each range session aligning my chronograph perfectly and trying a test shot or two to make sure it is set up where it can read my shots and if not, make more adjustments.  Setup for the Garmin Xero C1 Pro was simply a matter of setting it out on the shooting bench next to the rifle out by the muzzle (where you would likely place it so you could readily read the display anyways) and pointing it down range, pressing a button to turn on the power and a button to start a new session.  Even if you don't use the app and forgot to bring a pen to write down the data, no worries, it will save it for you.As I am a night hunter (hogs and pests), it would be nice to be able to use a chronograph after dark.  As the Garmin uses radar to 'see\" the bullet, I should be able to do my range work after dark if I need to do so.I paid a lot of money for this chronograph, but it has not disappointed me in any way thus far.  I am quite pleased with my purchase.",

        "review": "Purchased for an indoor budget simulator. Would recommend RCT balls as they pick it up better than regular balls. I hit roughly 200 chip shots and the R10 picks up on every slight mistake I do so I find it very accurate. Woods can be shorter than on the course but I would attribute that to the firm ground and roll outside. The biggest issue is having shots that don't pick up. Short chips (<10 yards) are virtually impossible, and drivers often don't register due to their lack of height. The R10 goes into standby mode often and I occasionally having to press the button on the back to reset it. I would suggest buying an alignment/leveling stand because if the R10 isn't facing the ball at the correct angle then misreads can happen. The camera almost never works for me. Software/app is mediocre, but the R10 integrates with several other programs nicely (TGC, E6, GSPro). The nuances are absolutely worth the price difference between other monitors on the market, if you're just looking for something to give you good numbers and run other software. I considered trading up to a Mevo+ but the readings were the same for both monitors and the Mevo+ putting was so bad that it wasn't worth it.",

        "review": "You have to like the price of this device and it is good Garmin is finally getting them back in stock.Now that I have used the product outdoors at the range I am updating my review and have added another star.  The R10 works very well as long as you take the time to set it up properly which is true of all launch monitors.  I did not have any other monitors to check the results but had a friend use a range finder to check distances and they were very close.  I did not pay for the subscription yet but I believe it could be used to simulate play at a course in Home Tee Hero with good results.I also want COMMEND the product support team they have worked with to attempt to resolve the issues I have had using the monitor indoors.  Using the Garmin Approach R10 indoors returns data well under what I should be seeing, by at least 20%.  I am an older golfer and the one time I had access to a TrackMan it clocked my swing speed between 65 & 70mph so maybe the algorithms used in R10  penalize slower swings compared to others.  If so, I can hope a firmware or app update fixes addresses this.  Another shortcoming I have found is how many missed shots there are when the clubs speeds drop below 30mph.  I think that it tries to allow for a pre-swing waggle and as a result ignores short, slow chip like swings.  Even below 40mph some the data that is calculated can be missing but it usually captures most shots above 30mph.  This could really impact the ability to use this device in an indoor simulation as chipping would be much more difficult.  The R10 has no way to capture putting so in the simulation it assigns a number of putting strokes based on distance from the pin, I knew this ahead of my purchase and have no issue with it. (I forgot to check this on the range so not sure if it is an indoor only thing or something I am doing wrong, the YouTubers don't seem to have this issue)  If I get that fixed it will be 5 stars for sure.On the plus side other than distance and carry being short, the data the R10 spits out is consistent and appears to be correct based on what I am seeing while using it.  Shots that go to the right of my target are reported as that direction, same for pulled shots that go to the left.  On the driving range app it is a little difficult to tell if there is a draw or a slice, just that it was offline and by how much.  Since it is radar-based lighting has no effect, so using it in a dimly lit garage should not be a problem or affect the data since technically you should be able to use it in the dark.In the end I am glad that I bought it and will continue to use it during practice.  At this price point I doubt there is a better product for the mid to high handicapper looking for feedback on how they struck the ball.  If you buy one make sure you update the firmware as that can make a huge difference depending on when the device was built.And once again product support has been excellent and continues to be quite responsive.",

        "review": "After 11 months using this product inside and outside, comparing data side by side to Trackman at Club Champion, this product is more than worth its price and is nearly identical to trackman #\u2019s. When using the simulator indoors, I highly encourage the Titleist RCT golf balls as it accurately tracks spin due to the reflective layer underneath the balls cover. If you don\u2019t have these balls, it\u2019s an algorithm to estimate spin which can be misleading to true spin numbers. If you\u2019re trying to fit yourself for a new driver, you need those golf balls. Without these balls, my spin was estimated to be around 4,000 RPM which i know is inaccurate. Once i put the balls in play, my spin dropped to my expected 1900-2200 number at 114 mph club head speed.I\u2019m using the r10 with the E6 simulator software and it\u2019s fantastic. The interface is already built in the garmin app, you just need a computer that can run the software. I\u2019ve used awesome golf and it wasn\u2019t realistic enough for me. E6 is LIDAR based and has a yearly subscription that is reasonable. I\u2019m using a gaming computer and have no issues. Again, the RCT balls accurately track spin, even on chips via the E6 software. It wasn\u2019t tracking this on chips (showed 0rpm spin) until I put these balls in place.My yardages are spot on to my exact carry numbers. I don't ever focus on total distance as that is always misleading for any simulator. I found that optimal indoor lightning is absolutely necessary for the simulator to capture each swing. You need ample room (about 8 feet) for the garmin to be able to capture the RCT ball spin #. The best thing about the garmin unit is ability to modify elevation, humidity, and temperature within the garmin app (if using E6 software you can only modify elevation). This is HUGE! Golfers underestimate all three of these factors when playing golf.There are a lot of weekend hacks on youtube that can't use launch monitors to their fullest capacity, and I can genuinely say this is a great unit.I feel you can benefit from this unit and would highly recommend if you\u2019re a data golfer like myself.",

Outside rim of the watch protects the bezel nicely. Looks good. Accurate GPS built in. HR monitor matches well with built-in HR in exercise equipment. Looks pretty good for a fitness tracker.Cons: Only one Cardio option. Pricier than the more flexible Venu Square. Can't customize display for fitness use. No Walk event tracking.I have been sticking with Garmin because I need accurate HR monitoring in the water, and most trackers disable their HR on swim functions. These seem to do a good job with that, and if you are an avid swimmer this would be a great watch for you. It has swim tracking and logging functions that I don't use, so I can't speak to those.With this watch being so much more expensive, you don't need your smartphone for the GPS to function, but I'm a little disappointed that there's only one, generic Cardio event for tracking. Otherwise there's Pool Swim, Open Water Swim, Cycling, and Running. I suppose you could use the Running Event to track a walk or hike.Wish List: Break Cardio event into a variety of events only distinguished by there name, for more easy history analysis in the Garmin Connect app. I would like to customize what's shown on the display screens during a recording event. For instance, when swimming I want to see distance, elapsed time and HR on the main screen. Instead, all you can see is the interval distance and time, with unused space at the bottom.So, all that being said, I like this watch. While there are some things I wish it would do, generally speaking it just works. I like not having to mess with a screen protector like I've had to with my earlier, raised bezel models. If you don't mind that, always have your smart phone on you, and need more flexibility, check out the Venu Square, but get the protection plan!",

        "review": "Update 16June2022: I just want to give a shout out for Garmin phone support. I was having trouble getting GPS to find satellites this summer, and it was losing track mid swim.  Mary Beth at Gamin support walked me through several paths to finally get the find time down to under a minute. She was patient and seemed genuinely interested in solving my problem -- a rare event from support lines these days. I'm still loving my Swim 2 after nearly a year.------- original review --------------My earlier Garmin Forerunner 310XT wrist GPS takes forever to achieve satellite lock, and it showed me zipping back and forth while I was open-water swimming, so I needed something new. It's all in the software, because a watch on your wrist will lose a satellite or two while it's under water, and the software needs to adjust for this and not think you have zoomed at high speed to the point where it regains satellite lock. Garmin has been working on this issue for some years, (as have others) and I'm very pleased with the results.I also borrowed an Apple watch for a few open-water swims. Tracking was excellent, but it has a feature that locks out any screen actions while swimming, making it somewhat difficult to control. Also, the Garmin is really built for swimming, so it has many more swimming metrics besides speed that make tracking your progress easier. The other advantage is that the Swim 2 software interface is very smooth on a PC, whereas you have to interact with an Apple watch with an iPad, Mac, etc. (There may be options for the interface that I'm not aware of.)The real killer for my use of the Apple watch was that it was less reliable reading my pulse while swimming. Both Apple and Garmin use optical pulse measurement, which is a bit dicey in the water (both say to adjust the band tight but comfortable), but often I would finish a swim to find that the Apple watch had not recorded my pulse at all. The Garmin may make some mistakes occasionally, but it keeps doing the best it can.Controlling the Garmin is not as intuitive as the Apple watch, but once I got used to it I didn't start activities unintentionally or make similar mistakes too often.On balance, the Garmin Swim 2 is a keeper and has replaced my Timex Triathlon as my main watch. The alarm, timer, and stopwatch features are more flexible than the old Timex and get a lot of use.",

There are many things I like about it, including the app.  However, after digging around the Garmin website, I realized that the watch and app do not automatically record pool swims when the lap time is over 1 minute 30 seconds for a 50 meter lap.  I am a senior and my best lap times for 50 yards are around 1 minute 40 seconds, which would yield a 1:54 50 meters.  Therefore, the hour-long swim does not auto register.  I have to add it to the app manually after the swim.  If I use the pool swim function on the watch at the beginning of the swim, it registers correctly.  Maybe everyone else knows about the speed issue, but I don't recall seeing it in the watch description or even in the app documention, without digging down several layers.  As mentioned in other reviews, it also does not register walks, other than steps.  I use the bike function on the watch to record my walk times, distance and routes.  It works, but I wish Garmin would add a walk function and raise the swim lap times.",
