This watch will display and respond to messages, answer calls, track workouts, and more. I'm extremely surprised by the battery life. Wearing this watch for a week and the battery is only 50%. No more charging every night. A long with the great features you get a stylish and comfortable watch. Easy to read no matter the light.I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who wants the modern convenience of a smart watch for a fraction of the name brand price.",

        "review": "Pleasantly surprised. Finally, a less expensive watch that does everything, and more, than my Fitbit did. It has all the features I used on Fitbit for half the cost. The battery is better as well. I also like the larger face size. Being able to customize the watch face to my specific needs was essential, and I can do this with this watch. I did have to buy a program to do that, but it was well worth the $20. Facemaker is the name of the program if other's want to do the same. I get a full week use out of the battery with 4 1 hour (average) workouts a week. I actually have about 20% left at the 1 week point. Heart rate seems to be accurate, although it only checks it once a minute (settable in the app). For workouts it seems to display heart rate in real time which I care about more than when I am not working out. The app that the watch uses is pretty good. It actually provides a LOT more information than I care about. The only thing I have found that I wish was better is having the ability to edit the workout face. You can edit the data and where that data displays, but you can't edit the size of each data display. I would really like to be able to do this. Even better would be the ability to edit the workout face in the app, as opposed to only on the watch. I have only had this a couple of weeks so there may be more I discover that I like or dislike. I will update if needed, but for now I can fully recommend this watch as a valid replacement for much higher priced watches.",

If you have an android or an iPhone, no worries this watch is actually compatible with both. You can also monitor your heart rate, steps taken and so much more. Setting up the watch is really easy and they connect via Bluetooth. Since I love working out, this is one of the features that I really enjoyed. It has more than 140 workouts something that the other smart watches do not have and it\u2019s at a fraction of the cost, which makes it even better. There\u2019s also an app that you can download that allows you to monitor your food intake. One of the great functions that this watch has is the ability to make and receive phone calls as well as text messages. A battery life on the watch is amazing. You can get up to 14 days depending on your usage. This is something I was not able to accomplish with my other smart watch.",

The band width is a bit snug. I wish they'd offer larger bands. My major squarm is the battery life when active. The watch has to be charged every four days. My Fitbit would last well over a week before it needed a charge. I do like that you can text and answer calls from your arm. The charging port could be a bit more user convenient. It was simple to connect this watch to my Android; it's compatible. Just make sure you go in to set the language to English. Also, you must download the app. I like the black color. The watch face is easily scratched though. I swam with it and it did well. Overall, it's a pretty decent watch.",

The long battery life is a huge reason why I love this watch. I have had it on for weeks and it\u2019s still at 1/2 battery level. It\u2019s functional and has everything that you could want in a smart watch, and more. You can get all your notifications on this watch, GPS, make phone calls, and send replies. It has so many health tracking features like different workout modes, sleep metrics, blood oxygen, stress, and heart rate. It\u2019s user friendly and easy to see notifications on the display, even in bright daylight. It is water resistant and very durable. I tend to break the screen of my other watches and this one is holding up strong! It even offers AI coaching for fitness. You can choose from tons of face watches to match your personal style. The screen size looks a little large for my small wrist but it doesn\u2019t feel bulky when on. Overall this watch is amazing. If you are looking to get a smart watch I would definitely recommend this one; yes even over the leading brands. Oh and there is no subscription fee!",

And when loosing connectivity due to distance or such, the watch and the Zepp app seem to reconnect very well.  I do not, and have not had to go through any BT reconnect process since my first pairing.The heart rate monitor seems much more reliable than other watches.  The sleep pattern and logging of such seems very accurate and reliable as well.  As with most watches, lots of functions and apps I'll never use, but the ones I do use, seem to work well.I like the excersize tracker functions.  One of the features I never thought about, but once playing around with it, I have found it very useful in incorporating into my routine.I did notice the compass and GPS all seemed to calibrate and function much quicker and with more accuracy with this T Rex 3.  I was pleased with that result.  The mapping feature is working and kind of interesting.  Not a feature I've used before, but can see where it could be worthy of trying.The ability to use phone, SMS and such works well, with replies and messaging working well paired with my Samsung Galaxy.In general, typical features found on this watch all seem to work as advertised.  The Zepp app has many, many features which seem to be interesting, but haven't yet played around with.  No issues with downloading or pairing or data updates from the watch.  All in all, seems like Amazfit and Zepp work very well together.As with most smart watches, the navigation through its apps and functions can be \"trial and err\", but I find this watch to be very near others and no more difficult while being and very similar to others.  The Zepp app can be intrusive with permission requests and such, but always having, and giving  the option to allow or deny.  All depends on what the user finds useful or not.Watch itself is very lite on my wrist.  I'm not a big fan of the band, more like a plastic, silicone band, but works fine, just not my preference.  Display is very nice and bright, clear and crisp. Battery seems to be working as advertised as well.  Vibration intensity and volume of the watch is beyond sufficient.All in all, very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this watch.  Don't have any real downsides to it yet.  In using this watch and considering it's cost, I can't image why anyone would spend more for other watches.

        "review": "First of all, I used to work for a major smartwatch company (which will remain nameless) writing manufacturing test software and running the data analytics team.  Thus, I was very much involved in the device data set uploaded to the cloud and the creation of device diagnostics, usability, and user preference analytics for our marketing and engineering departments.  From this point of view, I was very intimate with all the internal device components and how our devices were utilized by our users.I would have to say that this T-Rex3 watch blows away any of the smartwatches I have seen in my previous company at a reasonable price point.  It even has more comprehensive feature set than I have seen on my Garmin Venu 2 which I use everyday for my workouts.  I wore both the Venu 2 and T-Rex3 on a long hike and the health and workout numbers were very close.  Been using this Venu 2 for 4 years now almost everyday and I consider this to be the gold standard for GPS accuracy.I cannot stress how much battery longevity is a high priority to me as I know many users do not want to charge their devices daily as people forget and it is a hassle.  I personally make my smartwatch purchase decision starting with how long the battery will last.  BTW, I also owned an Apple Watch in the past and I stopped using it as I would forget to charge it daily, rendering it useless to me.Pros- Excellent battery life, almost 2 weeks using the GPS daily every day for at least 1 hour in myworkouts.  I believe the battery can run longer without such heavy GPS usage.-  Cost to own.  You will not find a better, more comprehensive smartwatch at this price point.-  I have proven its GPS and health feature set accuracy-  I like that it can capture Beidou GPS signals as I travel to Asia frequently-  Large high resolution color screen for my old eyes to see everything clearly-  Comprehensive set of watch faces, some free but some you must purchase-  Comfortable enough for me to wear 24/7 to enable me to collect sleep data-  Most of the settings and features like notifications are pretty standard for today's smartwatches-  Durability of this device to meet military standards suggests it should last...time will tellCons- It is a large watch, but it fits me.  42mm is my ideal size, but some may find it too big.- Very functional design, not the prettiest, but also not the ugliest- Appeals primarily to men which locks out 50% of the market who wants this feature set- Zepp app is average at best.  For instance, I cannot track the mileage on my running shoes like on theGarmin app.  I still like the Garmin app better.",

All depends on what the user finds useful or not.Watch itself is very lite on my wrist.  I'm not a big fan of the band, more like a plastic, silicone band, but works fine, just not my preference.  Display is very nice and bright, clear and crisp. Battery seems to be working as advertised as well.  Vibration intensity and volume of the watch is beyond sufficient.All in all, very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this watch.  Don't have any real downsides to it yet.  In using this watch and considering it's cost, I can't image why anyone would spend more for other watches.  Seems this watch is very near perfect with all the bells and Whistles anyone would need at a reasonable price.",

        "review": "First of all, I used to work for a major smartwatch company (which will remain nameless) writing manufacturing test software and running the data analytics team.  Thus, I was very much involved in the device data set uploaded to the cloud and the creation of device diagnostics, usability, and user preference analytics for our marketing and engineering departments.  From this point of view, I was very intimate with all the internal device components and how our devices were utilized by our users.I would have to say that this T-Rex3 watch blows away any of the smartwatches I have seen in my previous company at a reasonable price point.  It even has more comprehensive feature set than I have seen on my Garmin Venu 2 which I use everyday for my workouts.  I wore both the Venu 2 and T-Rex3 on a long hike and the health and workout numbers were very close.  Been using this Venu 2 for 4 years now almost everyday and I consider this to be the gold standard for GPS accuracy.I cannot stress how much battery longevity is a high priority to me as I know many users do not want to charge their devices daily as people forget and it is a hassle.  I personally make my smartwatch purchase decision starting with how long the battery will last.  BTW, I also owned an Apple Watch in the past and I stopped using it as I would forget to charge it daily, rendering it useless to me.Pros- Excellent battery life, almost 2 weeks using the GPS daily every day for at least 1 hour in myworkouts.  I believe the battery can run longer without such heavy GPS usage.-  Cost to own.  You will not find a better, more comprehensive smartwatch at this price point.-  I have proven its GPS and health feature set accuracy-  I like that it can capture Beidou GPS signals as I travel to Asia frequently-  Large high resolution color screen for my old eyes to see everything clearly-  Comprehensive set of watch faces, some free but some you must purchase-  Comfortable enough for me to wear 24/7 to enable me to collect sleep data-  Most of the settings and features like notifications are pretty standard for today's smartwatches-  Durability of this device to meet military standards suggests it should last...time will tellCons- It is a large watch, but it fits me.  42mm is my ideal size, but some may find it too big.- Very functional design, not the prettiest, but also not the ugliest- Appeals primarily to men which locks out 50% of the market who wants this feature set- Zepp app is average at best.  For instance, I cannot track the mileage on my running shoes like on theGarmin app.  I still like the Garmin app better.",

      {
        "review": "I have had this watch for a few months at this point. I have used a ton of different cheaper watches, and the accompanying apps. This one by far is beyond the others. First the watch faces are customizable you can use a large variety of free ones, you can purchase more in the app or you can use the custom watch face builder to create your own. The tracking of everything works well. I don't use any of the paid services, but there is plenty of information available for someone who is mildly interested in tracking sleep quality, steps, exercise, water consumption, activity levels, etc. More importantly for me, it sends me notifications, answers calls, has voice assistant, and tracks all of the above. It stays charged for an entire workweek. I charge it on my day off when I am just relaxing, then I am good to wear it consistently for the next week. I have eyed the pixel watch on and off, but the darn higher end watches don't stay charged long enough. So if you are not looking for a doctor on your wrist that gives perfectly accurate data this is a good choice. It seems pretty accurate for what I use it for, and I don't base medical decisions off the data, other than maybe saying I don't think I am getting enough sleep sometimes. If the pixel watch eventually can match battery life might try that out someday, but until then this is the brand for me. Oh and unlike all the other cheaper ones, this app stays connected and reconnects when it is back in range, I never lose my sleep or steps data because I forgot to link the app at exactly 11:59 at night, or ever. The only time I don't get data is when I am not wearing the watch.***update April 2025***This watch is still working fantastically. I work in a commercial kitchen, I am sometimes elbow deep in a sink full of dishes or covered to my elbows in degreaser, oil, sanitizer, or food of some sort. When I am just prepping food I will usually pull my glove up over the watch, but otherwise it is exposed to the abuse of the elements in the kitchen. Most of the watches I have used before seem to fall apart after a few months in the kitchen. I think some of the chemicals we use dissolve the glue that holds the face to the body of the watch. This one still looks brand new. There is a warning somewhere in the instructions to not expose this to prolonged hot water, the thing is I can't stop what I am doing to take my watch off, so I had resigned myself to just purchasing new watches when the old one broke. And if this one eventually falls apart I will replace it with the newest model of the exact same watch. The app for this watch just works. It tries to sell me upgrades every couple weeks but they aren't necessary to keep track of steps or sleep or anything else really. It still connects automatically whenever in range of my phone, and I do not have to think about it at all. I can ignore the app for weeks at a time and still go back and look at the data whenever I want. And when I am feeling like I want something new I just switch out the band. It is so nice to be able to view my messages when I am elbow deep in a giant batch of bread. For me this watch takes the abuse that I never expected it to, I have given up on the more expensive brands... They are never going to compare especially when it comes to battery life.",

        "review": "Pros:1. Sleep tracking is nice and more than I expected. It provides daily trends on sleep habits, including the time frames of REM, Deep Sleep and Light Sleep (all shown in separate parts in the same graph). Love this, and didn't expect I would use it, but I do. It reminds me to go to bed based on a goal. Provides sleep grades compared to others and this goal. And it has been successful in helping me track my overall sleep health, and to develop better sleep habits. This was an unexpected perk for me.2. Setup of the watch and the Zepp app was so much more painless than the initial watch I purchased and its app. It synced up quickly and correctly. The app started reporting, and transferring over to the Apple Health app right away once I got it all set up. It did take some figuring out how to get the Apple Health synced up, but that was a complexity issue more on the Apple side.3. The battery life is really good. I typically only have to charge every 3-4 days. Am very happy with the battery life considering how much I use the watch.4. The watch provides a wide array of health stats including the already described Sleep, Stress, Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen, Steps, Activities, Exercise, Calories, distance, and provides a PAI score each day that took a little to understand, but I now find very useful to just \"summarize\" if I'm staying active and healthy each day. I especially love the blood oxygen reading which I track every hour because I suffer from asthma that is allergy and autoimmune-related. I can now track when I might need to pay closer attention and \"take a puff\" before it gets really bad. I don't know how accurate this all is, but the readings make enough sense to be useful in tracking my overall systematic health, and I find that very useful overall.5. I know I have only \"unlocked\" and used half of this watch and Zepp watch's abilities. There is also geolocation capacities, which I look forward to using on a hike or outdoor activities.6. I also like the tap button on the side, and the many possibly configurations you can set up to customize how you interact with the watch. It's easy to push because it sticks out, unlike some other smartwatches that you have to push just right. I use my tap button for 1) short tap to access all the apps (and you can buy or download free apps - this is also nice), 2) long tap to wake my watch. I just love the flexibility in setting up the watch to fit your own needs and preferences.7. My texts and messages from iMessage on my iPhone and WhatsApp come through with no issues. I like getting those notifications on my watch and then going to my phone to read the message. The text is previewed on the watch, but any attachments, I have to go to my phone.8. I get reminders from my calendars (Google, Apple, Work) on the watch. I like that a lot.9. The weather app is standard in look and data. Nice to have.10. You can scroll down on each app and screen, and the watch drills down to a lot detailed information. Love this. The amount of details is great (even for the weather).11. Also have alarming options. I can set alarms on my watch for daily activities.12. I love the round watch face as opposed to the square or rectangular face. It's aesthetically a beautiful watch.Cons:1. Pricier than other smartwatches, but cheaper than Apple and other high end watches. For the price, I think it has a lot. So not sure this is a con. It's more than I wanted to spend. :)2. There is so much it took a few days to set it all up the way I finally wanted it, and some were not intuitive. I even have MORE to set up, just haven't.3. I may have missed it, but they have a stopwatch. Would be nice to have a Timer.4. The watch will notify you of incoming calls and missed calls, but does not allow you to make calls, nor is there voicemail on the watch. I don't miss this actually because I usually have my phone with me too. I get the notification on the phone, and I then know to call someone back or listened to voicemail of a missed call.Overall, I am very pleased with this watch. It does what is advertised. Other than a bit lengthy and complex set up, it's primarily an activities, health tracking with some daily management watch. And I am finding that's really all I need it for. My goal of developing healthier habits is helped significantly along with this watch.",

If you are jogging or sprinting there's a good chance it will come loose and fall off.I've remedied this by buying an alternative wrist band, but this feels like a basic design flaw that should not be there.2) The Zepp App used to control/read data from the watch is clunky and confusing.  It's not AWFUL, but could be a bit more intuitive.3) There is no alarm and the watch cannot set off an alarm on your phone.  It's wake up signal is to vibrate.  Why can't it get my phone to play a jingle along with the vibrtation seeing as it's already linked to my phone?It works pretty well...just has some annoying flaws",

        "review": "Honestly would not recommend this watch at all.First, the heart rate monitor and sleep monitor are very inaccurate. I compared the heart rate measurement several times during various levels of rest or exercise with the readings from my blood pressure arm cuff. While I was expecting some inaccuracies maybe plus or minus a few bpm the watch would report 90 bpm when my blood pressure device read 130 bpm and when my blood pressure cuff read 90 this would often read anywhere from 70 to 140. Sometimes tapping the measure button would read 130 and then 2 seconds later read 80.Second, the device has a feature where if you press and hold the screen you can quickly change the watch face. This is extremely annoying as the screen is extremely sensitive and I found if my coat sleeve slid forward it would trigger it, or if I crossed my arms it would trigger it, or just resting my arms in my lap would trigger it. There is no way to disable this feature and with how sensitive the screen is to any kind of touch from anything it gets very frustrating very quickly.Finally, most of these issues could still be overlooked to an extent but after having it for only about four months the screen popped out on me and was dangling by the ribbon cable connecting it to the circuit board. I carefully set the screen back in place and glued it back in using a compound that would seal it from moisture so it wouldn't get damaged further but that didn't last long. I glued it once more with some heavy duty glue but that also failed after about a month. The third time it popped out and I glued it back in the screen had solid white vertical lines so I popped the screen out and discovered parts of the wiring on the ribbon cable had cracked due to the screen hanging freely by it. Now, with no functional screen whatsoever I am unable to turn the device off at all since there is no physical way to turn it off without using the screen. Thankfully I was at least able to turn my alarms off through the Zepp app so it would stop buzzing when sitting on my desk.Overall, this thing is cheap garbage and I wouldn't waste a penny on it. Only reason I give it 1 star is you can't give it 0 and my mom likes it cause she has metal allergies and this is the first fitness tracker she's found that does not have any metal against the skin.",

        "review": "I've had several Amazfit watches over the years. My current favorite is the GTR4 (round, feature-packed, nice looking watch). I had always wanted to get the GTS4 (the square version) for a second choice, but couldn't bring myself to spend the money for it (It was around $150 at the time - still a good price, but I felt guilty, since the GTR4 was already so great!). Then the Amazfit Active came along for $84, so I decided to get it. I'm so happy I did. I got the black color, but it comes in a few more. I love the watch! It's super lightweight and feels great on my wrist. I even like the fold under strap - nice and neat. This little watch is pretty much the GTS4 minus a few features. It doesn't have a barometer or altimeter (but it does have a compass), no automatic brightness, and no camera remote (I think you can actually get one if you pay for an app). There isn't storage space on the watch for music, which doesn't bother me, since I don't store music on my GTR4, anyway. Other than that, I can't think of any features it doesn't have that my other watch does; and for everyday use, I don't miss those features. There is a single flat button on the side (no rotating crown), and I think it makes this watch look more sleek and compact. There are a ton of free watch faces, and the app store with many of the same apps as I have on the GTR4. The vibration is strong enough to wake me when I'm sleeping. The speaker is not quite as loud as the GTR4, but loud enough for telephone calls. Texting has the added feature of using a tiny keyboard to type responses, which I've actually been able to do when my phone was charging, so a pretty cool feature. The GPS is accurate. I believe it can do some of the same navigation that the GTR4 does (primitive map display, bread crumbs, return route), but I don't know how big of a route you can store on it, since I haven't used that feature (I'd take the larger watch with the extra memory on a hike). The heartrate, steps, sleep tracking, blood O2, and other health features are the same as the GTR4. The display, while smaller, is still easy to read and contains all the information you need in texts, health data, etc. Battery life is very good. I average about 10 days with moderate GPS use (walks or bike rides in my neighborhood, an hour at a time, three or four days a week). All in all, this is a great watch, and I'm happy I decided on this rather than the GTS4 (By the way, as of this writing, the GTS4 is $129!). I highly recommend this watch, and the Amazfit brand in general.",

        "review": "The Amazfit Active is an affordable smartwatch with lots of bells and whistles. I originally purchased the GTS 4, but found the stem was bulky and placed illogically with the slightest wrist bend taking me to the menu screen or rebooting itself. The Active is pretty much identical in shape and functionality but with a flat button making it less prone to accidental pushing by wrist movement and workout gloves.I am not wild about the silicone strap. It feels cheap and I'm having a hard time finding the right hole to ensure a decent fit on my small wrist. Amazfit makes a \"vegan leather\" strap for the pink watch it sells but I haven't found any replacement bands explicitly stating they fit the Active, which makes me hesitant to look for an aftermarket band.The app is okay, but for unknown reasons, some of the settings available with the GTS 4 don't seem to be available for the Active. For example, with the GTS 4, the app/watch was happy enough with the approximate location for displaying weather info. Not so for the Active. It annoys me it won't let me enter a zip code or an approximate location. The exercise/exercise settings feature is difficult to use and set up.  I haven't been able to find a way to customize strength training so I tried using the generic indoor fitness (or one of the other ones) but that, too, insisted on counting sets. I would think you could control at least some of the settings in the app but if there's a way, I haven't found it. My last gripe with the app is it reminds me every time I open the app functionality may be limited if I don't give it full access to everything it wants to access. I know this and I don't care. I CHOOSE TO TURN OFF SOME OF THE PERMISSIONS. Yet every single time I open the app, I have to select GOT IT and then exit out of the permissions settings on my phone.If you don't need a NAMED watch, the Amazfit Active has a nice design, good performance, great battery life and decent price point.",

        "review": "After my Pebble 2 SE started to wear down I switched over to the Amazfit Bip because at the time it was the only comparable smartwatch with similar battery life. Since then I upgraded to the GTS2e and now to the Balance. Needless to say I haven't found a reason to move away from Amazfit as I have always been happy with their watches.The most important feature for me is the battery life, I hate having one more thing to worry about charging if I travel or am away from a power source most of the day.  Though I have only been using the Balance for a few days, based on my experience so far I'm pretty confident you could go at least 7 days without needing a charge so long as you don't use the always on display or excessive GPS tracking.I have also enjoyed Amazfit's built in watch apps, they provide everything I need in a watch; notifications, the ability to take calls/respond to texts, a timer, alarm, and a find my mobile function that makes your phone ring when you misplace it.  The Balance also introduces an app store where additional apps can be downloaded. Its fairly limited compared to what is offered by Apple or Google, but its nice to have the option. The health tracking is just an added bonus in my book.As for the accuracy, I think it is accurate enough for what it is and can give you a good general sense of where your health metrics are at. It likely isn't as accurate as higher end fitness focused watches, but considering the cost, battery life, and user experience features it includes that are more akin to a traditional smart watch I think its a worthy compromise.The recent update to Zepp OS 3.5 has added its own built in AI assistant, Zepp Flow. It's nothing ground breaking, but it is nice to have and can make doing things like setting a timer, alarm, or starting a workout as easy as asking the watch to do it for you. It also includes Amazon Alexa which can be useful for controlling other smart home devices.Physically its very comfortable to wear, being thin and lightweight. I wear it all day and at night when sleeping without any issues whatsoever. The screen is also very vibrant and can get surprisingly bright which makes it easy to see even in direct sunlight. The included silicone watch strap is also comfortable and has a nice added feature. In the past I have had issues with silicone bands as the keeper that prevents the excess band from flopping around would wear down and allow the band to slip out, requiring me to constantly adjust it and slip it back in. The keeper on the included band has a small notch in it that allows it to plug into the last hole on the band so this should prevent it from slipping out in the future.Overall I think its a great watch for anyone that is looking for something in-between a dedicated fitness device and smart watch, it provides the best of both worlds at a reasonable price.",

        "review": "I've had some heart issues for a long time and this past year, they've gotten to the point where I need to do closer monitoring. Then, in July, I had a loop monitor implanted. While it sends a reading to my cardiologist's office every night, I needed something that would alert me when my heart rate fell above or below the doctor's parameters for my situation. I did a lot of research into a lot of watches. I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra so looked at the Galaxy watches and tried one, but the battery life is terrible. I needed a watch that had a battery that would last more than 12 hours with constant heart monitoring. I was already using an Amazfit GTS 4 Mini and loved it, the battery lasted almost 14 days, but it had no alert for heart rate and also was missing a couple other things I wanted/needed, so after looking at so-many-watches, I decided to try the Balance. So here's my review.The watch is large. At least for me, but the screen is amazing! Clear, easy to read, Amoled so the color is great. I chose to use the 'use your own photo' watch face which is new (I think) for Amazfit and I like it. There are several others to choose from and if they stay true to form, more will be added. There are a lot of apps pre-loaded on the watch and a lot to choose from to load so that would probably appeal to many who will use this for fitness. I do not so I can't speak to the fitness portion of the watch. I keep track of my steps/activity on the whole, but not any specific exercise. I got the watch on September 2nd, charged it, and with all of the heart associated apps turned on to run all the time (including running the heart rate monitor every 60 seconds,) I didn't have to charge it until the 11th, and even then, I was still at 18%, but we were going on vacation, so the battery life is great. Like I mentioned, the watch is huge, at least for me. It's 46mm, but light weight, so I don't really notice it much. It has a relatively slim profile on the wrist so I'm not banging into things with it like I thought I would. I did change the band to a stainless steel one because any silicone bands cause a rash for me. Those are the basics. Here's some of the pros and cons.PROS:Huge, clear, bright face that's easy to read, even for people who need glasses.Several watch faces to choose from including one you can personalize. Big plus!Heart/Health monitoring has been pretty accurate so far as tested at the cardiologist's officeSleep monitoring seems to be accurate, matching those times I wake during the nightWill follow DND on your phoneWill sync with Google Fit and a couple other third party health apps nowDifferent sounds per alerts so you know what alerts are coming in (can't change them though)Syncs well with Zepp app and changes on app are immediate on watchSilicone band will fit a 5-1/2\" to 10\"+ wristCONS:NO ECG. None of the watches Amazfit sells in the US has ECG. That was the first question I asked them and from their response, for the foreseeable future, they will not have a watch in the US that has that.The winder is very large and really sits high on the watch. It has the potential to catch on things and does during the night so if you use DND and wear it to bed, it will catch on the sheets at some point, wake the watch, waking you.No tap-to-wake, which my GT4 Mini had and which I miss a lot. It will still 'lift to wake' if you set that, otherwise, you have to push the winder.Second button on the watch is for workout information which I don't use, but it's very flat and seems like it would be hard to use while very active.\"Rotate the crown\" must mean the winder because the crown doesn't rotate and while the winder does, it only makes the face larger and not permanentlyTakes a 22mm watch band! Don't make the mistake of buying a 20mm which is a standard size.BEWARE! I went a whole day without getting any notifications. I reached out to Amazfit and they had no idea why I wasn't getting any either. Low and behold, there's an option called Cover To Mute. If that's checked and you're wearing a long sleeve shirt or sweater that covers the watch, you won't receive any notifications because the face is covered. Just letting you know!That's a flyover of the watch. On the whole, I like it. I've never been a big fan of the Zepp world. I'd be a lot happier if it was Android OS of course, but I understand their desire to work with either Android or Apple. They're getting smoother with the interaction between their OS and Android though. I'm sure I've missed a bunch, but this will give you a good idea at least.",

        "review": "To frame this review, I'd like to point out that I purchased this entirely for sleep and exercise tracking and am using a normal digital wristwatch for normal watch functions.This thing has great battery life, looks sharp, and is a great size for readability.  The UI is fairly easy to use and the touchscreen is responsive.I haven't used all of the features but lets go over the ones that I have.SLEEP TRACKING:This is the first device I've used that does sleep tracking and it seems to do a good job of it.  The graphs are informative and it has helped me tighten up my sleep schedule automatically.  I'm not sure of the science behind how it detects different states of sleep but it seems to be at least somewhat accurate.  On days that show that I had more deep sleep, I certainly do feel more rested.MUSIC CONTROL:I use this to control my music or podcasts when working out.  It works great and includes all the buttons you would need for that.ALEXA:The Alexa feature works great using the built in microphone.  I do miss the built in speaker of the Bip 5 and the dedicated button that allow you to access this feature quickly but you can only fit so much into a small package.I use the Alexa feature regularly to set a quick countdown timer, a nap alarm, or to create reminders.  It has also been useful for settling debates quickly e.g. \"What quarterback has the most passing yards of all time\".WORKOUT TRACKING:I've only used this with stationary workouts on an exercise bike but it does a good job of tracking and graphing your workout.WEATHER:The built in weather app works well and includes sunrise/sunset data as well as a 7 day forecast.  It's good info at a glance but lacks detailed forecast information such as hourly forecasts.NOTIFICATIONS:The notifications system works well.  You opt-in to each service you'd like to receive notifications for and your band will vibrate when one comes in.  It's great at a glance.  You can deny calls from the watchface, and send preset text messages (that you can customize in the app) when rejecting the call.  I really wish they had programmed it to where you could respond to text messages with canned messages as well.  Simple \"Yes\", \"No\", \"I'm on the way\", \"Running late\" etc would be extremely helpful.APPS / WATCH FACES:I counted roughly 30 free watch faces in their app store.  The vast majority are paid options but I was able to find several free that suited me.There aren't a lot of apps to choose from and I didn't find anything in the app store that seemed useful to me in my daily life.POMODORO TIMER:This is a very simple feature but it can be life changing if you use it correctly.  Basically this is a timer where you alternate between focusing on a task and taking a break.  A popular setup is 25 minutes of focus followed by a 5 minute break.I regularly use this in my work to make sure that I stay on task, while not sitting on a single task so long that I am spinning tires.",

Even if the watch lasts only a year (hopefully not the case) at less than $40 it was a great purchase.",

I don\u2019t regret my purchase at all!! I previously had multiple different Fitbits and this watch blows them all out of the water! My latest Fitbit kept automatically disconnecting from my Bluetooth so I wouldn\u2019t get my phone notifications - a feature that I had come to rely on. Fitbit customer service said it was because I wasn\u2019t manually syncing my device in the app enough (1-2 times per day wasn\u2019t sufficient, according to them, which is just absurd). I never had to do that with previous models and decided I was fed up. Not only can I confirm that this device stays connected to Bluetooth, but it does so without me even opening the app to sync the device, just like my older model Fitbits did. Sweet relief! It also gives the option to receive notifications from many different apps on your phone (social media, security camera apps, etc). And that\u2019s not all! The battery life on this thing is amazing! I charge it every time I take a shower so it never goes below 90%. I tested it the first few days by not charging it and, by my calculations, it would have lasted around 8 days before needing to be charged with every single health screening feature turned ON! That\u2019s incredible!! The display is gorgeous and the auto-workout tracker is extremely accurate. The only thing I will say is that I do think my Fitbit tracked my sleep better. There was one night that I was very restless and woke up three times to use the bathroom. Despite this, my Amazfit said I only woke up once. I literally walked steps to the bathroom, but apparently that wasn\u2019t enough to trigger an \u201cawake\u201d reading. I still think it\u2019s pretty dang accurate, though, and I choose this watch 100 times over. I can\u2019t say enough good about it! I loved the default watch face that it comes with, but I prefer digital clocks so I chose a different one (as you can see in the photo). I do wish there were more choices, or that you could customize what is displayed on a specific watch face, but there are still quite a lot to choose from and it\u2019s a huge visual upgrade compared to my previous Fitbits. I also like the \u201cstress\u201d tracker, though I\u2019m not exactly sure how accurate this feature is. Still, it\u2019s nice to be mindful of that and try to do some self care to bring those numbers down. Don\u2019t be swayed by negative reviews. My husband has a different model (more \u201crugged\u201d and \u201cmanly\u201d looking lol) and he loves his just as much as I do. This is a really good brand with a really good price point.",

        "review": "I was so hesitant to buy this because the reviews on smartwatches are always all over the place and I don\u2019t want to regret my purchase. I don\u2019t regret my purchase at all!! I previously had multiple different Fitbits and this watch blows them all out of the water! My latest Fitbit kept automatically disconnecting from my Bluetooth so I wouldn\u2019t get my phone notifications - a feature that I had come to rely on. Fitbit customer service said it was because I wasn\u2019t manually syncing my device in the app enough (1-2 times per day wasn\u2019t sufficient, according to them, which is just absurd). I never had to do that with previous models and decided I was fed up. Not only can I confirm that this device stays connected to Bluetooth, but it does so without me even opening the app to sync the device, just like my older model Fitbits did. Sweet relief! It also gives the option to receive notifications from many different apps on your phone (social media, security camera apps, etc). And that\u2019s not all! The battery life on this thing is amazing! I charge it every time I take a shower so it never goes below 90%. I tested it the first few days by not charging it and, by my calculations, it would have lasted around 8 days before needing to be charged with every single health screening feature turned ON! That\u2019s incredible!! The display is gorgeous and the auto-workout tracker is extremely accurate. The only thing I will say is that I do think my Fitbit tracked my sleep better. There was one night that I was very restless and woke up three times to use the bathroom. Despite this, my Amazfit said I only woke up once. I literally walked steps to the bathroom, but apparently that wasn\u2019t enough to trigger an \u201cawake\u201d reading. I still think it\u2019s pretty dang accurate, though, and I choose this watch 100 times over. I can\u2019t say enough good about it! I loved the default watch face that it comes with, but I prefer digital clocks so I chose a different one (as you can see in the photo). I do wish there were more choices, or that you could customize what is displayed on a specific watch face, but there are still quite a lot to choose from and it\u2019s a huge visual upgrade compared to my previous Fitbits. I also like the \u201cstress\u201d tracker, though I\u2019m not exactly sure how accurate this feature is. Still, it\u2019s nice to be mindful of that and try to do some self care to bring those numbers down. Don\u2019t be swayed by negative reviews. My husband has a different model (more \u201crugged\u201d and \u201cmanly\u201d looking lol) and he loves his just as much as I do. This is a really good brand with a really good price point.",

While the treadmill and watch do not usually match up, my fitbit was never this far off from the treadmill.

        "review": "After 4 months of using the Amazfit Bip 5 Unity fitness watch I found it to be very disappointing.  On the plus side it has a nice display, relatively good battery life, but when it comes to 'smart' and health and fitness monitoring, this watch falls short.  I don't like the user interface which requires swiping up or down or right and left to select various functions. Where to find settings is not intuitive and the software just doesn't work well at all.  Here are some reasons I dislike this product:- By default, it issues too many notifications and doesn't make it easy to change settings- Settings are in too many different places- One feature I really wanted to work is \"To Do\" list which allows the user to set reminders, but if you try to edit an item, it fails to find it, while it continues to send you notifications !??  I set reminders to do a certain activity during the day and this triggers an alert to remind me, but when the clock switched to Daily Savings Time, the reminders were delayed by one hour !?!- Some features worked for a while, but then stopped working, ie ability to receive txt messages, control your phone music player, receive app notifications - just stopped working - Did they update the software and broke it?- Support respond quickly to inquiries about problems, but the answers they provide tell me they are NOT familiar with this product.-  The step counter won't register activity until you've been stepping for quite a while which makes me wonder if it is accurate.-  Heartbeat measurements are NOT accurate-  Blood Oxygen measurements are NOT accurate-  Sleep monitoring is terrible - I wouldn't trust it.-  I tried to use Outdoor cycling tracking, but it fails to detect your mobile phone's GPSThis product tries to do a lot of things, but does most of them poorly.  Sure, it is relatively cheap at $50,  but it just doesn't cut it as a fitness  tracker, health monitor or smart device.",

        "review": "April 6, 2024: Update, I reached out to customer service because, well, the battery problem is simply unacceptable for only having it for just over a year. Let me preface how it is used: I wear it 24/7, but use it to 1) look at texts/calls as they come in 2) check the time, 3) use the stop watch for about 20 minutes a day total and 4) find my phone. Most of these features I only use about 5 times a week. I don't use it to play games or really much of anything that would suck the battery up too badly. So when I reached out to customer service their response was very obviously automated asking me to troubleshoot the problem. No issue. When I did and said more or less, \"it is pretty obviously the battery\", they essentially reiterated ways I could try to \"save\" the battery life, with another automated response. Suggestions included:Please refer to the following instructions to troubleshoot the issue:1) The watch charging takes about 2.5 hours, please confirm whether your watch is fully charged;2) The battery life may vary according to settings, usage, climatic temperature, and other factors. So the actual result may differ from the laboratory data.3) The more power-consuming applications in the watch will also shorten the battery life.  Please also check whether the watch is with the latest firmware.  If not, please upgrade the watch and observe the battery performance;Note: The following apps would cause fast power consumption: screen display, sleep breathing quality, frequent use of Bluetooth phones or listening to music (if supported), the Screen-on Duration for too long, too many notification reminders, Always On Display enabled, GPS for a long time Exercise, turn on Auto Blood Oxygen Monitor, etc.4) Then please do the following settings to see if the watch battery life will improve.* Set the Response speed of Lift wrist to view info function to Normal mode* Turn off the Always On Display* Disable Sleep breathing quality monitoring* Disable Auto Stress Monitoring* Disable Auto Blood Oxygen Monitor* Change the Screen-on Duration time to 5 seconds* Do not choose any Wake-up Mode for Offline Voice ControlIt has now been 4 days since that reply, at which point I reiterated that it is very obviously an issue with the battery and disabling any and all of the above \"suggestions\" would defeat the purpose of having a smartwatch. I'm still waiting on a response. Changing my review to a one star because of the customer service.March 31, 2024: I've had this watch for over a year, 16 months to be exact. All of a sudden the battery life just tanked, despite using it exactly the same as I always have in the past. It's battery life is okay but only lasts about half as long as it used to.Additionally, it has issues with notifications where it will continue to display text notifications that I've already read and acknowledged.  Again, not a big deal but annoying.Overall, it is an okay watch. I'm not sure if I intend to continue using it moving forward or if I will get something different.",

Easily connects to external sensors if you want to wear a strap but so far the wrist monitor has been great.

They want it or be exclusively AI based and yes when it works it's quick and super convenient but when it misses you have zero. ZERO ability to edit or enter manual foods.  It's a new feature for zepp so hopefully they build this out to Include more traditional food database entry. For now it's just not useable for anyone serious about nutrition. Thankfully it's easy enough to just ignore it and use another option like Samsung health or my fitness.Id say it's 90 of a Fenix for 30% of the price.",

        "review": "Fantastic watch! Was waiting for this one because the T-rex was just too bulky to wear business wise. The Balance 2 looks amazing. Has so many great options. Watch faces are very informative. After wearing an Apple Watch for 8+ years I was so surprised to find out that there are other watches out there that supersede the Apple Watch by miles on battery life, screen size, options and design. No negatives so far. Received it last week, used it frequently, battery percentage now around 59%.I used the watch for strength exercises and running. It was spot on!",

I had a balance and a garmin approach s70 and when they introduced the balance 2 with golf I had to try it.  I compared the 2 for two rounds and the amazfit was just as good.  Not as many golf features but just the ones I need.  I sold the garmin and put money in my pocket and only use 1 watch now for everything.  Love the sleep tracking.  No complaints.  You do have to download the courses you are going to play where the garmin has them all pre loaded.  Only takes seconds per download.",

One feature I found useful is the Alexa support, unfortunately Amazfit has removed Alexa support on the Balance 2 in favor of their own Zepp Flow AI which doesn\u2019t allow me to control the various devices in my home. The Balance 2 is a beautiful well made watch but removing Alexa support is a dealbreaker for me. I have returned the watch to Amazon.",

        "review": "I\u2019ve never looked forward to a watch more\u2014and been so disappointed\u2014than with the Balance 2. I had high hopes and eagerly awaited its arrival, but the reality didn\u2019t live up to the anticipation.First, while it may seem minor to some, the bright blue bezel was a dealbreaker for me. I was genuinely surprised that Amazfit launched this device with only a bold blue option. It\u2019s a puzzling choice, especially when most people would likely prefer a more neutral color scheme. In person, the blue is brighter than it appears in photos and clashed heavily with the included red band. The combination just felt off, and I couldn't understand why multiple color options weren't offered from the start.Second\u2014and more frustrating\u2014is the display's inability to repel fingerprints. It\u2019s one of the worst I\u2019ve experienced. Despite the Sapphire glass, fingerprints stick easily and require constant wiping. I\u2019ve used many watches, including the Apple Watch Ultra, and never had an issue this bad. It became a daily annoyance.Third, the performance was underwhelming. On certain watch faces, the second hand would freeze, and navigating the app list would lag or become unresponsive. Oddly, the Balance 2 felt slower and less stable than the original Balance 1.While I appreciate the effort Amazfit made with the Balance 2, the execution fell short. Perhaps the $299 price point doesn\u2019t allow for higher-end materials or better performance, but ironically, the Gorilla Glass on my T-Rex 3 handled fingerprints far better. So did the Balance 1.In the end, I returned the Balance 2 and will likely return to Garmin. A lot of potential here, but too many compromises.",

It requires installation of the app, which you can then use to download different watch faces and enter your personal information. It took less than 10 minutes to download and install all of the watch faces I wanted to try.I love that the device has great battery life. This is the primary reason that I wanted to try using a 3rd party app despite being an iPhone user. What I later discovered after my first workout has prompted me to return the watch for a much pricier Apple Watch SE 2. While the device seemed to have comparable heart rate readings to the treadmill I was using, the distance calculation was off. I have a short stride, so their default treadmill setting doesn\u2019t appear to work for me. I walked 2.5 miles, but the watch stated that my total distance was 2.83 miles. While this isn\u2019t a huge difference, I can see how it would add up on longer walks. There is also no way to edit the entry in the app to correct the information. In addition, my step counts seem to take time to add to Apple Health. The information from the VeryFit app appeared to be logged in Apple Health, but for some reason, the data was not being added to the total steps for today. It seems like there is some kind of lag, which isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but it is inconvenient to wait for everything to update.I wish this watch had worked out for me. Unfortunately, the lack of ability to calibrate distance makes this watch pretty useless.",

I was chaulking it up to my old watch being worn out and I just wasn't moving as much. Even during the holidays where I am running most of the day, I couldn't reach 9k steps compared to almost 20k for previous watches. Today I have been doing house work since waking up ,while I am doing the dishes, I get a notification that I have been sitting for more than an hour and need to get up and move. This cemented my thoughts on the accuracy of tracking movement. It's a great watch overall but it's barely worth it for me if the step feature is not accurate as that is one of the main reasons I own a smart watch.",

I cannot say enough good things about it.Cautions - get the screen protectors, it scratches a LOT faster than my Apple watch did, but at this price I wasn't surprised.Comparing to the Apple watch, the system software is a little cumbersome.  Some things you have to do on the app, some things on the watch face.  Coming from the Apple - it's just not quite as intuitive.The size is great.  So much easier to see things than the Apple.  And it does pair just fine with my Iphone (I was worried about that).  For IOS users - you do need to leave the app open, but all the functions are there and it sucks up almost no battery.",

Unlike Fitbit\u2019s \u201cactive zone minutes\u201d which has a clear calculation methodology (1 active zone minute for every minute HR is in fat burn zone, double that in the cardio/peak zone), PAI calcs are much less transparent. Also PAI is based on a rolling 7-day count of your full day\u2019s activity, and doesn\u2019t reset week to week like Active Zone minutes. All this to say that you have to be fairly consistent in achieving a higher level of activity every single day to maintain the target PAI of 100, unlike the Fitbit where you can feel good about earning your Active Zone Minutes for the calendar week in shorter periods of more intense activity. I suppose this should be a motivator, but it also feels like I\u2019m getting dinged if I take one rest day in a week because it affects my present PAI. Also, you can earn PAI more easily from getting your heart rate up to the anaerobic zone, even if it\u2019s a shorter workout and you burn fewer calories than in a longer, more sustained workout at a lower heart rate zone. Eg. Getting your heart rate up to 95% of your max for 20 mins and burning 170 calories is worth more in PAI, than a 1-hr workout at 70% of your max heart rate and burning 350 calories. If you don\u2019t care about tracking the PAI metric, then this shouldn\u2019t bother you.Overall a good product!-------Update: Comparison with FITBIT Versa 2- HR monitor. The Amazfit overestimates heart rate during exercise. Eg. during Zumba workouts my peak HR gets up to 190 bpm on the Amazfit vs 157 on Fitbit (which seems more feasible - not out of breath!)- Calories burned. Similarly, the Amazfit overestimates calories burned during exercise - for a 50 min dance workout, the Amazfit registers 340 calories burned, vs Fitbit's 228.- Activity auto-tracking. The Fitbit can sense activity even without turning the \"exercise\" function on but the Amazfit is not sensitive to this.- Steps. Fitbit's more generous in counting steps than Amazfit; my 50-min dance workout gave me almost 4000 steps on the Fitbit, vs 3,450 on the Amazfit.-  PAI vs Active Minutes. Amazfit's PAI metric mostly rewards cardio workouts, whereas Fitbit rewards you for time spent on exercising even if it's lower intensity.",

Battery lasts days and recharges fast! You can get alerts for calls and messages (I have it linked to direct calls and texts and WhatsApp), answer or reject calls using the phone, gives current weather when linked to your phone, tracks your cycles etc. Great and accurate at tracking heart rate, blood pressure, sleeping patterns and have good workout tracking options. And my favorite feature that really makes this watch shine is that it\u2019s waterproof! I wear it 24/7, in the shower/bath etc and wait for it for swimming on a regular basis. It tracks laps I swim and after 2.5 years it\u2019s not showing any issues with water getting in! How amazing is that! Not even Apple Watches do that, in fact my iPhone 12 died after a few months of purchase after wearing it around a water park with less than 5 mins of min shallow water submersion! Handles rough wear and tear well too! Looks great, fit and feel is great, works amazing, most durable tech gadget I\u2019ve ever owned, highly highly recommend!!! It really is the full package!

It takes a while to get everything set up but once done it was well worth the investment.Costs an extra $2.99 for the Notify for Amazfit app's pro version (that's all that's needed) for text/call messages displayed on a high resolution screen.No more pulling out my phone to find out it's one of those robo calls... A simple twist of my wrist is all it takes.Did I say battery life? I now get about 1 and 1/2 to 2 weeks which is way more than I would have ever expected considering I use this all the time and the display is always on and the heart rate is being taken every 5 minutes.I initially got this according to the sleep reviews I was reading but now find it to be an indispensable tool without always having to reach for my phone.Which now stays in my pocket mostly.The addition of a pretty accurate weather forecast keeps me from going out without a coat if needed here in Las Vegas which can be unpredictable at times during the winter season.The inclusion of a Pomodoro Timer was very unexpected and being put to use.I use other apps and devices to get my workout data and have not tried to see how it performs against this device but they all integrate well with Google Fit.I can't comment much about the steps feature as I only care about how much time I'm doing an activity and the heart rate monitor seems to be good enough to show that I'm working at it thoughout the day automatically and the built in PAI display tells me as well.No inexpensive wrist-based watch can give any pulse accuracy you can Bank on. The ones that do are all giant size and this one fits very nice on my wrist.And be multi-functional like this one.All in all a very good smartwatch at a low cost compared to the competition.Amazfit Mini -- You're the best for me!!!",

        "review": "05/22/22 - I have had this watch for a little over a week (using with a Pixel 6 Pro). My summary take is: lots of good with a few rough spots.Pros:* Price: For the cost and what it does, this thing is a great value.* Battery life: As I am writing this, it has been seven days since I took it off the charger and I am sitting at 37% batter. Pretty outstanding.* Comfort: This thing is comfortable. Numerous times I have caught myself looking down at my wrist the make sure I am still wearing it. I literally can't tell that I am still wearing it at times. It is so lightweight. Also, I don't feel compelled to remove it when I get sweaty, as I have for other smart watches I own. Even when it gets sweaty, it is easy to wipe clean.* Sleep tracking: I am certainly not a sleep tracking nut, so I can not speak to the nitty gritty of things like REM tracking and such. But I will say that this has accurately tracked my general sleep duration every night this past week. And it is automatic! I previously used an app on my phone to track my sleep duration, but I would have to manually start it and stop it each night/morning. But with this watch, I just go to sleep and it automatically tracks it.* Music control: This is an important feature to me because I like to be able to play/pause my phone's music without needing to pull my phone out of my pocket. The music controls are not quite as convenient as what you'll find on Wear OS, but it certainly gets the job done.Cons:* Google Fit integration: This is hit and miss. It does seem to accurately track my daily steps to Google Fit. Exercise activity is a different story. The only two exercise types I have explicitly done on the Amazfit are indoor biking and outdoor biking. In both cases, the Zepp app syncs those to Google Fit as \"Others\", not as their actual exercise types. Not a huge deal, but I wish those were synced to Google Fit as what they actually are.* Voice assistants: The watch comes with Alexa support built in. I have not tested this yet because I am not an Alexa user at all. My house and other devices are 100% Google Assistant driven. Coming from a primarily Wear OS smartwatch life, it would be nice if I could set Google Assistant up on the Amazfit as opposed to Alexa, but I am pretty sure that Alexa is the only option here.",

Speaking of watch faces, there is a decent collection, and they are very reasonably priced!  I plan to get more pretty soon, but not before I finish this review. Overall, it is fairly simple and straight forward to activate the watch and to get apps and watch faces for it.*You need to activate some features before they will work.  I did NOT activate any features.  I am using ONLY the out-of-the-box features. EXCEPT that I did purchase and install a snowman watch face.*The way it should operate is that when you lift your arm to look at it, it lights up; otherwise, it remains dark(off).  But this is not actually what happens.  The watch needs to determine when you are moving to look at the face, so that it knows when to turn the screen on.  Well, the sensor in my watch is very, very sensitive.  Sometimes I can just move my arm a little bit and the screen will come on.  Although, most times the screen does react properly.  Also, sometimes I get annoyed because it will go off to quickly. I try to listen to my 8 yo grandkid talk to me, and when I look back at my watch two sentences later, the screen is off.  I am sure there is a setting for that, but right now, I am not changing anything from factory settings outside of what I had to do to activate the watch.*I have some issue with the button on the side of the watch, but I am just not actually sure what it is.  I THINK that when I lift my arm up while I am pushing the button to view the time, that it causes the watch to scroll to give more information about the statistics posted on the face.  Not positive that is what happens though, because it does not happen that often.  Also, the button digs into the back of my hand when I am active and it bends backwards.  Sometimes that activates it and causes the problem above, but I do not catch it until it's too late to KNOW what happened.12/19/2024 Update:*It has been 15 days since I activated and started using my watch.  I still have about one-third of the battery life left!  That just blows my mind.  Everything is the same as it was above, I am pretty positive that I was correct about the issue with the button.December 28, 2024  battery is finally ready to be recharged.  I am fairly positive I would have had another day or two, but I do not want to push it.  So, the initial charged battery (out of the box) lasted 25 days.I will come back and update if something comes up with the watch, or if I experiment some more.  I am not worried, even if it does go nuts or something, I bought the protection plan.",

The band in the picture is the H\u0113msut leather band you can get separately.I am converting from a Fitbit Versa 4 that has served me well, but I did it a battery injury while in a hospital bed FOR 2 MONTHS and it now needs to be charged daily to log my heart rhythm and SpO2 levels, which is too easy to forget. I need the hourly logs to have with me for cardiologist visits as we monitor my artificial heart valve, 20 years old and still running!The T-Rex Ultra is OVERKILL for what I want, but I was after the battery life and water resistance (I\u2019ve murdered a couple watches in a swimming pool, finding that \u201c10m water resistance\u201d doesn\u2019t compete with dive ratings) which it covers across the board. I charged it when it arrived, then had to run through 3 firmware upgrades to get to the current OS, Zepp OS 4. That was 3 days ago. The watch, despite having hourly testing on, WiFi active, and live Accuweather running, still has 76% left on the battery. That\u2019s awesome!A lot of the workout tools I have only poked at, not put to use fully, but I am recovering from muscle atrophy following my hospitalization. When the weather warms up, the pup and I will be putting it to use and if there are issues, I\u2019ll come back and add it.Overall, considering I was looking at a Garmin watch for 3 times the cost, I\u2019ve compared capabilities between it (my close friend owns it) and the Amazfit holds a dead even rating. That says a lot!Thus far, I\u2019ve banged the glass into my guitar and the inside of my server with absolutely no scratching. The steel frame helps.Overall, for health needs, I can log everything in Apple Health on my iPhone, export to a spreadsheet in Google Docs, and have detailed info for my docs when I have appointments.

I was never happy with the battery life, I was having to charge every day. Then I purchased this watch after doing some research. It does everything the iWatch does, but in my opinion better. It looks great and it is very dependable and rugged. The battery life is great. For example, I charged my watch four days ago and I am at 75% now. I would highly recommend this watch.",

However, it stores the information in the watch until it is reconnected and able to sync. You\u2019re not able to use Alexa or have the weather on your watch until the app and watch are synced. Other than that it does everything those $200-$600 watches do. But this will only cost $50 unless you can catch it on sale like I did and got it for $35. This thing is amazing. I recommend it to everyone. The accuracy of step counting is great it might be off by about 30 steps at times. You can change what workouts appear at the top. It has about 15 to 20 different workouts from squash to running indoors to running outdoors. I use the squash setting for Racquetball. And the watch battery last between 6 to 7 days if you don\u2019t have the continuous heart monitoring on. However, when you use the workout settings, it monitors your heart rate while in use. The charging speed is about it says two hours, however if I put it on the charger for about 15 to 20 minutes, it\u2019ll go from dead to about 50%. The comfort of the watch sometimes I barely know it\u2019s there however I think the band it comes with. I will change when I can. I think the durability is about the same as any other watch. Get a screen protector and you\u2019re pretty good. However, it says if you drop it then that might mess with the waterproofing ability. The weight of it is pretty decent. It\u2019s almost like it\u2019s not even there. The only reason that I know that I\u2019m wearing the watch is because of the band that comes with it hits why I want to change it. It looks amazing.

The setup of it was easy and I had no difficulty.  It does have less memory on it, but I think I can live with that.  I can also pair it with the Fitbit app which allows me to get my credits from my health insurance.

My one complaint is that the app that connects it with your phone drains a lot of battery on your phone. I have a Galaxy with good battery life, but it is draining twice as fast and is constantly sending me system notifications that the VeryFit app is using high amounts of system resources and is slowing down my phone.

I use a timer at work in 30 sec or 1 min intervals.  This feature is buried in the menu and not user friendly at all.  Overall, the watch works ok for this price point but not for what I really need it to do.  All the fitness features clog up my phone as well.  I delete them and somehow they reappear.  My text message alerts work sporadically.  Sometimes the watch Bluetooth with override my vehicle Bluetooth or the phone speaker that I chose to use.

I daily use the hourly reminder to get up and walk! Its like having a small coach on my wrist! Additionally it is waterproof so I can wear it in the shower.The face of the watch is large and bright, with settings I can change at bedtime. There's even a chat availability on the phone app.  I have an Android phone and have experienced no issues with the app whatsoever.And I love trying out new faces and decor on the front! Thank you for manufacturing a great and reliable product!Alison Van RynenToledo, Ohio",

        "review": "I was very impressed with the watch when I first received it.  For once, I had found a smartwatch that fairly accurately recorded my vitals - Pulse, blood oxygen, blood pressure, and steps.  The watch has more than a sufficient number of watch faces to choose from and it is a perfect size for my wrist.  The battery life, I feel, is not as good as they claim, but it does last for about 8-9 days after a full charge.  Of course, I only use a limited number of notifications, do not use my watch for a phone, and only use the functions that make sense for me as a 71-year-old male.The application that you are supposed to use with the watch is not as good.  It does not stay connected to the watch and takes an excessively long period of time to connect and show your data after opening the app.  I have an iPhone 14 so that should not be an issue.  Another thing is the weather.  The application only connects to the local weather when you press the weather data in the upper left-hand corner of the app, and it rarely transfers that information to the watch.  I like to be able to look at my watch to see what the current temperature is.Now for the reason that I am only giving this watch a one-star rating and I will update it if the manufacturer responds favorably - or unfavorably.Virtually all of the functions of the watch, and especially the ones that I use most often, quit working 4 days after the 30-day return date expired.  I now have to deal with the manufacturer.  It still gives me the time and date, notifies me of emails that I receive from my phone, and gives me my blood pressure reading.  Nothing else.It is not easy to get to someone that you can actually speak to at Amazon when you press the \"Call Me\" button on the \"Get Product Support\" tab.  When I finally was able to speak with someone to ask for the manufacturer's phone number, all she had in her system was their physical address.  She was very polite, hard to understand, but polite, and gave me the warranty department's email address and instructed me to request the information from them.  I have done so, and now am waiting for a response.  I have purchased a metal watchband and screen protectors specifically for this watch, so I hope the manufacturer will honor their 2-year warranty and make this right.At this point, I would not recommend spending $99 for this smartwatch, but will update this review once my problem is resolved - hopefully satisfactorily.UPDATE:  After several emails to AMAZON, I finally was given good contact information for the seller and I made contact.  That same day, Thursday, February 8th, I received a message from the seller telling me they were going to send me a new watch and told me that it was not necessary to return the malfunctioning smartwatch.  The scheduled delivery date for the replacement smartwatch was Thursday, February 15th. The seller exceeded my expectations and the new watch was delivered today, Monday, February 12th!Everything seems to be working as it should and the BP readings that I am getting are actually realistic!  AMAZTIM honors their warranty, so for that reason I am bumping my review up to 4 stars.  If AMAZON's communication methods were a little more customer friendly the rating would be 5 stars.  Thank you AMAZTIM.  If the replacement smartwatch continues working as it is now, you will see no more on this review.",

But the reason I only gave it three stares is that one of the main purposes I perched this watch was to monator my sleep and it only works about 1/3 of the time with the watch alway set to the same tightness and same wrist. Also the weather app is does not work at all and there is no way to manually set my location in it. Also this one might just be me being picky but it does have a tone of watch faces but I really haven\u2019t been able to find one I really like.Update on watch the customer survive for Thea product is top notch.

Its very sensitive to being moved around though which causes some inaccurate tracking of steps. I like the big and bright display and that I can change the brightness and how long the screen stays on. Notification are helpful, though I do wish they stayed on the screen longer.The big problem I have with it is comfort. The band rubbed my wrist raw and its taken over a week of not wearing the watch and putting ointment on the wound to make it heal. I have since bought a new band and it feels much better.Still a good watch for the price.",

The strap is a perfect fit for any wrist size and comfortable to wear 24/7. Highly recommend! In the past I have had two other smart watched from this company. They last a long time so I keep coming back to the watch I trust and thy improve it more each time. I take baths and showers and never take it off unless I need to charge it and clean it.

Battery lasts days and recharges fast! You can get alerts for calls and messages (I have it linked to direct calls and texts and WhatsApp), answer or reject calls using the phone, gives current weather when linked to your phone, tracks your cycles etc. Great and accurate at tracking heart rate, blood pressure, sleeping patterns and have good workout tracking options. And my favorite feature that really makes this watch shine is that it\u2019s waterproof! I wear it 24/7, in the shower/bath etc and wait for it for swimming on a regular basis. It tracks laps I swim and after 2.5 years it\u2019s not showing any issues with water getting in! How amazing is that! Not even Apple Watches do that, in fact my iPhone 12 died after a few months of purchase after wearing it around a water park with less than 5 mins of min shallow water submersion! Handles rough wear and tear well too! Looks great, fit and feel is great, works amazing, most durable tech gadget I\u2019ve ever owned, highly highly recommend!!! It really is the full package!

        "review": "I use the Notify for Amazfit app to add way better sleep tracking which includes heart rate measurements too.This is used with Sleep As Android app.In addition to excellent battery life, I also get my text and email notifications so I can stay on top of things. It takes a while to get everything set up but once done it was well worth the investment.Costs an extra $2.99 for the Notify for Amazfit app's pro version (that's all that's needed) for text/call messages displayed on a high resolution screen.No more pulling out my phone to find out it's one of those robo calls... A simple twist of my wrist is all it takes.Did I say battery life? I now get about 1 and 1/2 to 2 weeks which is way more than I would have ever expected considering I use this all the time and the display is always on and the heart rate is being taken every 5 minutes.I initially got this according to the sleep reviews I was reading but now find it to be an indispensable tool without always having to reach for my phone.Which now stays in my pocket mostly.The addition of a pretty accurate weather forecast keeps me from going out without a coat if needed here in Las Vegas which can be unpredictable at times during the winter season.The inclusion of a Pomodoro Timer was very unexpected and being put to use.I use other apps and devices to get my workout data and have not tried to see how it performs against this device but they all integrate well with Google Fit.I can't comment much about the steps feature as I only care about how much time I'm doing an activity and the heart rate monitor seems to be good enough to show that I'm working at it thoughout the day automatically and the built in PAI display tells me as well.No inexpensive wrist-based watch can give any pulse accuracy you can Bank on. The ones that do are all giant size and this one fits very nice on my wrist.And be multi-functional like this one.All in all a very good smartwatch at a low cost compared to the competition.Amazfit Mini -- You're the best for me!!!",

        "review": "05/22/22 - I have had this watch for a little over a week (using with a Pixel 6 Pro). My summary take is: lots of good with a few rough spots.Pros:* Price: For the cost and what it does, this thing is a great value.* Battery life: As I am writing this, it has been seven days since I took it off the charger and I am sitting at 37% batter. Pretty outstanding.* Comfort: This thing is comfortable. Numerous times I have caught myself looking down at my wrist the make sure I am still wearing it. I literally can't tell that I am still wearing it at times. It is so lightweight. Also, I don't feel compelled to remove it when I get sweaty, as I have for other smart watches I own. Even when it gets sweaty, it is easy to wipe clean.* Sleep tracking: I am certainly not a sleep tracking nut, so I can not speak to the nitty gritty of things like REM tracking and such. But I will say that this has accurately tracked my general sleep duration every night this past week. And it is automatic! I previously used an app on my phone to track my sleep duration, but I would have to manually start it and stop it each night/morning. But with this watch, I just go to sleep and it automatically tracks it.* Music control: This is an important feature to me because I like to be able to play/pause my phone's music without needing to pull my phone out of my pocket. The music controls are not quite as convenient as what you'll find on Wear OS, but it certainly gets the job done.Cons:* Google Fit integration: This is hit and miss. It does seem to accurately track my daily steps to Google Fit. Exercise activity is a different story. The only two exercise types I have explicitly done on the Amazfit are indoor biking and outdoor biking. In both cases, the Zepp app syncs those to Google Fit as \"Others\", not as their actual exercise types. Not a huge deal, but I wish those were synced to Google Fit as what they actually are.* Voice assistants: The watch comes with Alexa support built in. I have not tested this yet because I am not an Alexa user at all. My house and other devices are 100% Google Assistant driven. Coming from a primarily Wear OS smartwatch life, it would be nice if I could set Google Assistant up on the Amazfit as opposed to Alexa, but I am pretty sure that Alexa is the only option here.",

There are so many watch faces to choose from to customize the watch to fit your personality.  The step count is accurate and I'll be using this to keep up with my steps for a work competition and to keep up with steps for my own fitness.  It connects with the Veryfit App and it integrates with my work fitness app YuMuuv using the Health Connect app.  My kids actually thought this was an apple watch.  I can do everything that it seems they can do for a fraction of the price.  The screen size is large, and the display is bright and colorful.  I can text easily from the screen, answer phone calls, and use Alexa.  I love this watch!",

The band in the picture is the H\u0113msut leather band you can get separately.I am converting from a Fitbit Versa 4 that has served me well, but I did it a battery injury while in a hospital bed FOR 2 MONTHS and it now needs to be charged daily to log my heart rhythm and SpO2 levels, which is too easy to forget. I need the hourly logs to have with me for cardiologist visits as we monitor my artificial heart valve, 20 years old and still running!The T-Rex Ultra is OVERKILL for what I want, but I was after the battery life and water resistance (I\u2019ve murdered a couple watches in a swimming pool, finding that \u201c10m water resistance\u201d doesn\u2019t compete with dive ratings) which it covers across the board. I charged it when it arrived, then had to run through 3 firmware upgrades to get to the current OS, Zepp OS 4. That was 3 days ago. The watch, despite having hourly testing on, WiFi active, and live Accuweather running, still has 76% left on the battery. That\u2019s awesome!A lot of the workout tools I have only poked at, not put to use fully, but I am recovering from muscle atrophy following my hospitalization. When the weather warms up, the pup and I will be putting it to use and if there are issues, I\u2019ll come back and add it.Overall, considering I was looking at a Garmin watch for 3 times the cost, I\u2019ve compared capabilities between it (my close friend owns it) and the Amazfit holds a dead even rating. That says a lot!Thus far, I\u2019ve banged the glass into my guitar and the inside of my server with absolutely no scratching. The steel frame helps.Overall, for health needs, I can log everything in Apple Health on my iPhone, export to a spreadsheet in Google Docs, and have detailed info for my docs when I have appointments. I couldn\u2019t ask for better usability.100% cat compatible!",

I purchased iWatches for the features, heart rate, exercise, etc. I was never happy with the square shape, but I used it to monitor my activities, sleep, heart, oxygen. I was never happy with the battery life, I was having to charge every day. Then I purchased this watch after doing some research. It does everything the iWatch does, but in my opinion better. It looks great and it is very dependable and rugged. The battery life is great. For example, I charged my watch four days ago and I am at 75% now. I would highly recommend this watch.",

I took it on 10 day vacation to Mexico and swimming in the ocean was no problem with this watch.Quite accurate heart rate and step counter as well as O2 levels. Didn't try blood sugar or blood pressure monitor but that's not what I bought it for in the first place.Two small nuisances... On the 1st time getting GPS lock can take some time but it works fine afterwards, second...I still do not understand why the Amazfit didn't implement option to increase font size on the watch on the 4th iteration of Trex.Screen resolution and AMOLED display are certainly excellent and I don't see why they can't or won't do itBottom line I would recommend this watch to anyone looking for rugged SmartWatch with long battery life, extensive amount of watch faces and customization, external applications and so on.It is not on pair with Garmin watches for professional athletes but for every day use for fraction of the cost definitely highly recommended.",

The Very Fit app was easy to set up and I was using the watch quickly. Customer service was friendly and helpful. I haven't had any issues but they helped with the registration, warranty and a free gift. I like that the app makes learning the features of the watch and app a game that earns you \"coins\" every time you complete a new task.

Had a Samsung watch before, but switched to iPhone and watch didn't work well with the Merge app and it was going to cost a monthly fee.  The gold face is a matte finish which was what I was hoping for and is just the right size for my arm.  Setup and connection was easy and functions are comparable to that of my Samsung, just taking some getting use to.  Battery life is exceptional.  After a full week of wear, I finally had to charge it this morning.  So far so good!",

        "review": "I received the watch today and was eager to try it out. The set-up is very simple. It requires installation of the app, which you can then use to download different watch faces and enter your personal information. It took less than 10 minutes to download and install all of the watch faces I wanted to try.I love that the device has great battery life. This is the primary reason that I wanted to try using a 3rd party app despite being an iPhone user. What I later discovered after my first workout has prompted me to return the watch for a much pricier Apple Watch SE 2. While the device seemed to have comparable heart rate readings to the treadmill I was using, the distance calculation was off. I have a short stride, so their default treadmill setting doesn\u2019t appear to work for me. I walked 2.5 miles, but the watch stated that my total distance was 2.83 miles. While this isn\u2019t a huge difference, I can see how it would add up on longer walks. There is also no way to edit the entry in the app to correct the information. In addition, my step counts seem to take time to add to Apple Health. The information from the VeryFit app appeared to be logged in Apple Health, but for some reason, the data was not being added to the total steps for today. It seems like there is some kind of lag, which isn\u2019t a deal breaker, but it is inconvenient to wait for everything to update.I wish this watch had worked out for me. Unfortunately, the lack of ability to calibrate distance makes this watch pretty useless.",

        "review": "One week ago, I would have rated this with 5-stars.  However, for some unknown reason, the battery life, which was 3+ days, has gone down to about 8 hours.  I haven't downloaded any apps or changed the settings I have been using for the past month; the only change has been some sort of software update.I'm giving a temporary 3-stars in hopes that I can figure out a solution.  If I can, I'll bring this up to 5-stars.  If I can't, I'll lower this to 1-star and return it.  Either way, once I figure out what I'm going to do, I'll provide better feedback with what I like and dislike, etc....====Update:  So, after the watch completely discharged its battery, and I let it fully charge again, I'm back to a full 3 days of use.  The only setting I changed after it charged was turning the 'connections -> wifi' from 'auto' to 'off'.  I figure I almost always have my phone, and if I don't, I'm probably not near an open access point WITHOUT a captive portal (requiring browser-based login).  That doesn't necessarily explain the battery drain because this was how I had the setting previously.This is a great watch, based on what I was looking for.  I previously had an LG G watch, one of those goofy-ass rectangular smartwatches, and other than the style, i really liked the functionality.  I like the style of many new round smartwatches, but they were either prohibitively expensive (Tag Heuer), or the battery life was crap (most smartwatches), or, in the case of the LG Watch Sport and Style, you either got more than you wanted and paid for it, or not enough.My criteria:Looks (subjective, but essentially, a round smartwatch that wasn't too bulky, but with a screen big enough to use)Functionality (had to work with a non-Samsung Android smartwatch, show notifications from hangouts, SMS, calendar, etc)Battery Life (had to very easily make it through 24 hours)Non-LTE versionI think the watch looks great.  I'm a bigger dude, so the watch doesn't look out of place and huge on my wrist like some of the other photos I've seen.  If you have svelte features, maybe the size would be problematic.  I'm using the standard band that comes with the watch, which looks good, but I like that I can easily switch bands if I want to.Functionally, the watch is great.  I get notifications from SMS and Hangouts, as well as from Google calendar, which I use at work for upcoming meetings.  Initially, as I was researching the watch, I wasn't sure if a non-Samsung watch would pair well with this, since it doesn't run Android Wear (it runs Samsung's Tizen OS).  The only issue with regard to Tizen is the lack of apps, but I don't really care about extending the capabilities beyond what it already does (wihch is what I need/want).  The watch has decent sensors for 'exercise', though I suspect there are superior watches for that.  I don't exercise that much and don't care about measuring my heart-rate anyway.  I can feel my heart about to explode out of my chest when I play hockey, which is a good enough indicator that I'm getting some exercise.Battery life is awesome.  I'm currently on my third day since its last charge, and other than the weird drain issue I first wrote about, the watch has been solid.  I do currently have wifi off, as well as location, since I usually have my cell phone nearby; the watch gets that info from the phone.  Knowing I can turn either of those on, if I needed to, is nice.  I also have my watch face set to only turn on when I move my wrist or push a button.  I've read that keeping the display always-on would reduce battery quite a bit.  Good thing I'm not always looking at the watch face.Bonus features!Samsung Pay.  I never used Android pay (NFC) for purchases.  I was sort of waiting until it was more ubiquitous and expected, as opposed to everyone looking at you like 'one of those types'.  That's just my own insecurity though.  But with this watch, I just press a button, select a card, and then hold the watch near the card-paying-thingie (NFC terminal) at the store.  That's great and all, but what's really super great is that it doesn't have to be an NFC terminal.  As long as it's got the magnetic strip, this watch will work!  I tried it at a local liquor store and the woman said, \"this device is really old and doesn't have that fancy technology.\"  I replied, \"this watch is magic, check this out!\".  We were both pretty impressed.Another feature I really like is how you can reply to messages.  There is an old phone style keyboard, with 2-3 letter per number, which is just terrible.  There is the ability to speak into the watch, which I don't use because nothing comes close to Google's speech recognition, in my option.  And the other option is to draw the letters on the screen.  I wasn't sure how well that would work; it works great!  Just draw each letter, quickly, if you want, with an underscore for a 'space', and then send.  Love it.Finally, Dick Tracy, you can answer phone calls through your watch.  Just speak into it.  I haven't really used this, and figure I will never use it unless I'm tied to a shark, which is tied to a missile, or maybe if I'm driving (I don't have Bluetooth in my car).  But it's cool.Anyway, this is a good watch.",

        "review": "Note: I have a Samsung Note 5, and that is the phone this watch was used with.I did a ton of research before buying my first smart watch about 6 months ago. Before I purchased this, I did some cursory research and found the Gear S3 was still pretty great, despite newcomers to the market, so I purchased it.When I first got the watch, I was so excited. I put it on and paired it and was super impressed with the exceptionally well designed and responsive UI. Using the bezel to control the watch is a stroke of pure genius, honestly. Despite the small area of the physical face of the watch, and how very tiny the icons on it are, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I was able to easily and without error interact with the small icons.Then came the disappointment.The app store for the Gear is exceptionally anemic, primarily consisting of watch faces and applications that are very niche. There is no Gear support for Pandora, or Audible. Absolutely no Google apps are available for it. No Google Now. No Google Maps (although there is a well-designed app available in the store that uses Google Maps for like $2). No Android Pay. No Gmail. Nothing. The Spotify app is pretty nice, but for some reason I can't select Spotify Radio stations in it, only playlists. I was exceptionally disappointed as I have based everything in Google. Pretty much, the only apps that are really any good are from Samsung. This was a further disappointment as Samsung apps are usually fat and offensively slow.I contemplated returning it in favor of a Huwaii or a LG Watch Sport, but I figured I'd give it a few days. The interface is just SO well made. It is very responsive. The Samsung apps actually aren't crap this time, and they covered most of the use cases I have for my watch. So I gave it a few days.This is the part where the 5 stars come in.After using it for a few days and acquainting myself with it's various idiosyncrasies, I began to realize that all I actually need for it are the Samsung apps. It *would* be nice if there were apps from Pandora and Audible and CityMapper and Moovit and it supported Google Now, but it doesn't and that is actually a very workable scenario.The watch allows me to control my phone, basically, without taking it out of my pocket. So while I'm on the bus, if I swipe down on the watch face and hit the music note icon, I can control all aspects of the playback on my phone from the watch. Rewind, fast forward, pause, change the volume, change tracks, all of it. The altimeter is very accurate. I can create reminders and appointments right on the watch face. It displays the weather and my agenda using very will designed UIs. With a tap, I can zoom in on the weather and agenda to get more information, and I can plot the route to an appointment, if I included location information in the calendar item (although you have to open the phone to see the route). There is an Uber app for the watch that makes it very easy to call a cab.Finally, the watchfaces. Yes, they do get their own section because they are varied and amazing. Personally, I love the PipBoy Fallout 4 watch face. It displays an amazing amount of information using the interface of one of my favorite games. This watch face displays the following information, but you can find probably another 100 that do the same in zany and creative ways: Time, Date, Heartrate, Water Consumption, Coffee Consumption, Battery Level, Step Count, plus shortcuts to Music and Pictures, Samsung Health Daily Review, Alarms and Calendar. I wish the PipBoy interface showed the temperature, because if it did it would be on there too.Now, for the downsides, and there are some doozies.1) Samsung Pay does not work on my phone because I enabled the Samsung-provided Knox feature. I later disabled it because I didn't like it. But you know what that did? It flipped flag on my phone that disables Samsung Pay. The Gear only works with Samsung Pay. Let me repeat that - A Samsung supplied feature, Knox, disables Samsung Pay, because it flips the flag that says the device has been rooted. You are probably thinking \"OK, so I contact Samsung support and they fix it, right?\" Nope. Samsung has no way to flip this flag back. They designed Knox in such a way that it makes your phone think it has been rooted, and they have no way to fix it if Knox is later disabled. That is exceptionally stupid. I am an engineer. I am aghast to think of the internal processes at Samsung that allowed a feature to be released into the wild that breaks your phone and does not supply a fix. It requires a monumental level of dysfunction for that to happen.2) You are limited to the Samsung ecosystem. So if you don't like Samsung mail, too bad. No other mail client available. Don't like Samsung Pay? Too bad. No other option available. Etc.3) If Samsung Mail is enabled, and it is connected to a company mail server that requires the watch to be encrypted to view mail, you will have to type in a pin just to check the time. Yup, you read that right. Want to just check the time really quick? Nope! You gotta type in your password first. Again, as an engineer, how does that get through focus testing without any developer hearing a customer say \"that is amazingly stupid\". How does a developer, in their OWN DEVELOPMENT of the software, not get tired of typing in their password to check the time? It's amazing.4) When you make the motion typical of checking the time on a watch, the watch face is supposed to light up automatically. I've found this to be rather untrue. I've found that it pretty much doesn't work unless you are moving your hand from a stationary position, such as standing at a bus stop or sitting at your desk. If your hand is in motion it doesn't seem to recognize the motion to look at it, despite the rather unique motion of rotating the wrist. That is a very unique movement, and I noticed that this does not happen to a friend who has the Apple watch. It seems to actually be keyed on the wrist flip to turn on, as it turns on in a movie theatre when you place your hands behind your head.In summary, great watch despite the lack of app support",

        "review": "UPDATE: 8\\12\\19I just wanted to come back and report that my original Gear S3 is still going strong and that I ended up giving it to my Mom who is still using it without any issue. I loved my bluetooth version so much that I purchased another one off of Ebay for a mere $100.00! This was probably 8 or 9 months ago and it is the AT and T version and it was used in like new condition.  I do not use the LTE, I continue to use it as a bluetooth device only and it works flawlessly!! Samsung really hit it out of the park with the  Gear S3 Frontier. I can still get 2 and a half days out of it and it is running the latest software. I can not no comment on the current versions of these watches but if The Gear S3 Frontier is any indication, I'd say get one if you want a smartwatch!First off, this is my review for my Bluetooth Only model Gear S3 Frontier running Tizen 3.0.0.1 that I purchased here on Amazon from the seller Ocean Reef Electronics.I am using a Nexus 6P running Nougat 7.1.2. Now, on with the review!UPDATE: Had a defect with the used 6P that I purchased so I returned it and am now using a Motorola X Pure Edition and I must say,  battery life is even BETTER!! I guess it's the better radios in Motorola devices,  so my watch isn't working as hard to maintain a connection maybe?  I'm not sure but it has greatly improved my battery life. It used to be down to about 55% to 58% when I'd go to charge it the next day,  now it's still at at a good solid 78% charge.*NOTE: Just a suggestion but after having issues with my Fitbit Blaze failing after a year and one month due to the thin layer of film on the back cracking from sweat and causing the battery to overheat and the tracker to die, I decided to put a tempered glass screen protector on the display AND the back panel of my Gear S3 Frontier. Some folks seem to be having the same issue with their S3's that I had with my Blaze and I'm hoping that the additional protective layer will keep my Gear S3 Frontier from suffering the same fate. You may also want to add one as well if you have not already. Just  wanted to throw that in there. Now back to the review!I absolutely LOVE LOVE L-O-V-E LOVE this watch!!! First off, I am one of those people who thought smartwatches were just a gimmick to get people to spend money needlessly. The reason I purchased this watch is because I got mad at Fitbit LOL! Seriously. I bought a Fitbit Blaze a year and a month ago and one silly little flimsy piece wore out (because of poor quality material used) and instead of letting me use my offered 50% discount towards a new model tracker that has addressed the admitted material issue, they told me I could either get a free replacement Blaze Pebble (the tracker without the straps)  pay them for a new Blaze or pay them for a model that was inferior to my Blaze. Instead, I went with a free Blaze Pebble, and while I was waiting for it to arrive I came here on Amazon to look at smartwatches. I ended up going with the Gear S3 Frontier and I am SO glad I did!!PROS:I live in the boonies and connection is spotty in my house so what can I do now? I can leave my phone in the living room where I get good signal and walk around the rest of my small house and still receive notifications, text messages,  and make and receive phone calls over bluetooth ON MY WATCH!!! I know some folks say the fun of this wears off quickly but because of the poor reception on my phone, it has been an absolute Godsend to be able to leave my phone in a good reception location and still make and receive phone calls and get notifications on my watch. The sound quality is exactly that of my phone on speaker. I use this feature almost exclusively when I'm at home. I don't have bluetooth in my car so I use an output jack in my car and while I don't talk on my watch in the car very often, I do use the controls on my watch to answer calls that go to my phone so I do not have to reach down and get my phone to answer calls. It is so much easier to swipe to answer on my wrist while driving.MUSIC I  easily figured out how to transfer music from my phone to my watch and I have had no trouble listening to the songs on my watch, both through the built in speaker and by way of bluetooth earbuds without any trouble. I also have no trouble with using the music controls on my watch to control the music player on my phone and I love how quick and easy it is to switch sources right there on the watch screen. Now, I've only tested this in the house. The true test will be when I'm outside mowing grass and I have my phone wrapped in a bandana in my pocket. I imagine it will work just fine but I've not been out to mow since I've gotten my watch. It's so nice, I'm not even sure I'm going to use it while mowing.UPDATE 10/2/18 I have had many opportunities to use the music controls in and outside the house and they work brilliantly! I am able to use the watch to control the music that I have stored on my watch AND I can also use my watch to control my playlist if I am listening to music that is stored on my phone. Infact you can go back and forth between the two immediately, right there on the watch. I had RF ablations done on the right and left side of my back and both times I went for the procedure, the surgeon and his staff had my play the music on my watch! The first time internet was down and they couldn't access Pandora and I had left my phone out in the waiting room with family so I volunteered to play music out loud that I have stored on my watch. They were all blown away lol! So much so that when I went back a few weeks later for the procedure to be done on the other side of my back, the surgeon said, where's that awesome watch, I want you to use it again to play music! I thought that was funny. :-DSOS: I have not had a chance to actually try this out but I do have emergency contacts plugged in and I am happy to know I can use my watch to ring for help if my phone is out of reach.CUSTOMIZATION: I love just how customizable this watch is. Everything is so easy to replace or customize. The bands are easy to replace, the watch faces are easy to change and customize. I use the Gear store as well as the Facer app and while you can pay for your watchfaces, there are so MANY free ones that I can't see myself ever needing to shell out money for new watchfaces. I even purchased some Awinner brand rubber body guards to not only add a layer of protection to my watch, but also allow me to change up the colors of my watch. I like how I can use one of my songs as a ringtone or notification tone and how it give me an option to start the song from the beginning, or where the song becomes enthusiastic, if that is where I would prefer my ringtone to start.UPDATE 10/2/18 This is an update about the Awinner colored protectors, not the watch watch itself. I mentioned above that I use the Awinner frame covers not only to change the look of my watch, but to protect my watch during periods of high activity but I stopped using them for that purpose because sweat was collecting under the rubber. After 3 or 4 hours of pushmowing the yard, I'd come in and take the frame off and there would be alot of sweat pooled on the inside of the rubber, so much so that I became worried it would cause sweat damage to my watch so now I use the colored frame covers for asthetics only. Right now I'm wearing a gray and black stripped nylon band with the white colored Awinner rubber frame protector and it's kind of looks like I'm wearing Jack Skellington on my wrist! I get a chuckle everytime I get a glimpse of my watch on my wrist, besides it is October right now as I type this lol.FITNESS FEATURES: Ok let me first start off by saying I am not a super fitnessy person. With that said, I think this watch blows my Fitbit Blaze out of the water with it's fitness capabilities. While I have had a chance to wear both my Blaze and my Gear S3 Frontier at the same time to try and do a comparison, the comparison could not be perfectly accurate because I had my watch on my right wrist and my fitbit on my left. The first time I tested it, of course the watch logged about 600 more steps than my fitbit blaze did, but I think that's because I had the watch on my dominant hand and so far as I can tell, there is no way to adjust that setting like you can on a Fitbit. So what I ended up doing is the next day, I wore the watch on my less dominant hand and the fitbit on my more dominant hand and this time the Fitbit was logging more steps, so I have come to the conclusion, that atleast when it comes to the Blaze and the Gear S3 Frontier, the step count is roughly the same and definitely more accurate if you wear it on your non-dominant hand.Another fitness feature I love is the \"get up and move\" nudges! These are AWESOME because they aren't just nudges to get up and take some steps, it actually gives you an option to perform one of three preloaded exercises. \"Twist\", which is locking your fingers together, pushing your arms straight out in front of you and twisting from left to right. There is \"Reach Up\" where you do your arms the same but you go up and down instead of side to side. Then there are \"squats\" where you cross your arms across your chest and push your elbows out and squat down. Or if you don't want to do those options and you'd rather just get up and walk around you can do that too. The only thing I do wish, is that it would keep counting after I do the initial 5 reps. It is neat how it counts them down four you but it only counts 5 and then the screen goes back to the homescreen even if you keep doing the reps. It would be nice to have a bit of continued on screen encouragement from the watch.UPDATE 10/2/18:I still love the watch for fitness BUT Fitbit really is on to something with their 250 steps an hour goal reminders per hour because while the move reminders are nice what with having onscreen choices for other activities besides walking, I REALLY wish it were more like the 250 steps an hour that Fitbit has going on their trackers. I wish I could customize and hourly goal or even have the same set hourly goal like Fitbit and get reminders and incouragement that keeps you going for more than  5 counts. I NEED that motivation lol! Unfortunately the fitness aspects of the watch are not quite as motivating as I would like for them to be. I still prefer it for the build quality, over anything Fitbit has to offer though but I really do wish they would update their fitness software to better compete with Fitbit's. I don't even need the SHealth app to be like the Fitbit community, I just want the tracker software to be more like that of Fitbit's tracking software with the hourly nudges and onscreen encouragement.HEART RATE SENSOR: The heart rate sensor on my watch performs about as accurate as the one on my Blaze did and both where in a few beats of the heart rate sensor I use on the nursing unit where I work.FIND MY PHONE/GEAR: YEAH!!! It is so nice to finally have a way to find my phone when I've set it down somewhere and I can not remember where lol!UPDATE 10/2/18 I use the find my phone/ gear feature ALL THE TIME!! I mean, the frustration I have saved (alone) has made this watch worth it to me lol!BATTERY LIFE: I work at night so I charge my watch before I go to bed during the day so that it can be fully charged by the time I go to bed. This allows me to leave my phone in my living room and still go to bed being able to make and received calls. My battery could probably last me a good two and 1/2 days with the way I have mine set up but I chose to charge it everyday an hour or so before I go to bed. I usually get down to 48 to 53% after a 24 hour period which is quite acceptable to me considering all my watch does. UPDATE: as I stated at the top, I switched to a motorola device and now my battery is at a solid 78% battery life after a 24 hour period the way I have it set up.CONS:I only really have one and if they fixed it this watch would be 100% perfect to me and that is the notifications. If you receive a series of notifications from the same source, messaging, facebook messenger, etc, you only see the latest one that was sent to you so if you are asleep or somehow don't notice you've received a message, when you open your notifications on your watch, it will only show you the last response sent to you and none of the previous ones which is probably the silliest think ever. It's not a huge deal for me because I really do not have contact with very many people but if you use your phone for business or you are very social, this is going to bug the heck out of you.All in all this watch is AMAZING!!!! Easily the best electronical purchase I have ever made and I have absolutely zero regrets so far.",

No Google Maps (although there is a well-designed app available in the store that uses Google Maps for like $2). No Android Pay. No Gmail. Nothing. The Spotify app is pretty nice, but for some reason I can't select Spotify Radio stations in it, only playlists. I was exceptionally disappointed as I have based everything in Google. Pretty much, the only apps that are really any good are from Samsung. This was a further disappointment as Samsung apps are usually fat and offensively slow.I contemplated returning it in favor of a Huwaii or a LG Watch Sport, but I figured I'd give it a few days. The interface is just SO well made. It is very responsive. The Samsung apps actually aren't crap this time, and they covered most of the use cases I have for my watch. So I gave it a few days.This is the part where the 5 stars come in.After using it for a few days and acquainting myself with it's various idiosyncrasies, I began to realize that all I actually need for it are the Samsung apps. It *would* be nice if there were apps from Pandora and Audible and CityMapper and Moovit and it supported Google Now, but it doesn't and that is actually a very workable scenario.The watch allows me to control my phone, basically, without taking it out of my pocket. So while I'm on the bus, if I swipe down on the watch face and hit the music note icon, I can control all aspects of the playback on my phone from the watch. Rewind, fast forward, pause, change the volume, change tracks, all of it. The altimeter is very accurate. I can create reminders and appointments right on the watch face. It displays the weather and my agenda using very will designed UIs. With a tap, I can zoom in on the weather and agenda to get more information, and I can plot the route to an appointment, if I included location information in the calendar item (although you have to open the phone to see the route). There is an Uber app for the watch that makes it very easy to call a cab.Finally, the watchfaces. Yes, they do get their own section because they are varied and amazing. Personally, I love the PipBoy Fallout 4 watch face. It displays an amazing amount of information using the interface of one of my favorite games. This watch face displays the following information, but you can find probably another 100 that do the same in zany and creative ways: Time, Date, Heartrate, Water Consumption, Coffee Consumption, Battery Level, Step Count, plus shortcuts to Music and Pictures, Samsung Health Daily Review, Alarms and Calendar. I wish the PipBoy interface showed the temperature, because if it did it would be on there too.Now, for the downsides, and there are some doozies.1) Samsung Pay does not work on my phone because I enabled the Samsung-provided Knox feature. I later disabled it because I didn't like it. But you know what that did? It flipped flag on my phone that disables Samsung Pay. The Gear only works with Samsung Pay. Let me repeat that - A Samsung supplied feature, Knox, disables Samsung Pay, because it flips the flag that says the device has been rooted. You are probably thinking \"OK, so I contact Samsung support and they fix it, right?\" Nope. Samsung has no way to flip this flag back. They designed Knox in such a way that it makes your phone think it has been rooted, and they have no way to fix it if Knox is later disabled. That is exceptionally stupid. I am an engineer. I am aghast to think of the internal processes at Samsung that allowed a feature to be released into the wild that breaks your phone and does not supply a fix. It requires a monumental level of dysfunction for that to happen.2) You are limited to the Samsung ecosystem. So if you don't like Samsung mail, too bad. No other mail client available. Don't like Samsung Pay? Too bad. No other option available. Etc.3) If Samsung Mail is enabled, and it is connected to a company mail server that requires the watch to be encrypted to view mail, you will have to type in a pin just to check the time. Yup, you read that right. Want to just check the time really quick? Nope! You gotta type in your password first. Again, as an engineer, how does that get through focus testing without any developer hearing a customer say \"that is amazingly stupid\". How does a developer, in their OWN DEVELOPMENT of the software, not get tired of typing in their password to check the time? It's amazing.4) When you make the motion typical of checking the time on a watch, the watch face is supposed to light up automatically. I've found this to be rather untrue. I've found that it pretty much doesn't work unless you are moving your hand from a stationary position, such as standing at a bus stop or sitting at your desk. If your hand is in motion it doesn't seem to recognize the motion to look at it, despite the rather unique motion of rotating the wrist. That is a very unique movement, and I noticed that this does not happen to a friend who has the Apple watch. It seems to actually be keyed on the wrist flip to turn on, as it turns on in a movie theatre when you place your hands behind your head.In summary, great watch despite the lack of app support",

        "review": "First of all, I have to explain how & why I landed on this particular watch.++ I would definitely recommend this watch to anyone, looking for a cheap alternative watch, that has various functions and looks nice.  In fact, I\u2019m  already trying to convince my girlfriend to pick a color and so I can get her one.\u2022 I\u2019ve had my Apple Watch since 2017. When I bought it back then the main purpose was to track my various workouts & daily activities. I often do P90X, Insanity, or Body Combat workouts, other workouts include outdoor workouts with resistance bands, battle ropes, medicine balls, & weighted jump ropes.- So having a watch with an accurate Heart Rate function is paramount for me!\u2022It\u2019s always bothered me that the Apple Watch had to be charged daily, which meant it couldn\u2019t be used to track my sleep with my overnight work.  Also the battery degraded 2 years ago, but Best Buy would not replace it because it wasn\u2019t bad enough ( smh).So my search for a smart watch with long battery life & compatible with iPhone 14 Pro Max began.  I was hesitate to make the move, I even considered just gutting it out for the newest Apple Watch hoping for better battery life.  Then Apple Watch began to crash 100% battery to turn off mid-workout reboot saying 12%.I ordered this watch after reading the battery life could extend beyond 7 days easily.I was  pleasantly surprised with how easy the setup was connecting it to my phone via the CMF Nothing App.\u2022I will say, they should consider making it easier to change the watch from 24hr clock to 12hr clock that required me googling and searching to figure it out.  There\u2019s no way to change it directly from the watch it must be done from the app on phone.\u2022\u2022 I learned this the hard way, I took nap 11:30am woke up for work 5pm, put the watch on noticed it was 17:00. At my job as card dealer for a casino we get 15min breaks every hour or hour & twenty mins and must be back promptly so, I had to figure out how to get that clock to 12hr setting immediately.I love that this watch also has the Find My Phone feature like Apple Watches, I was worried about losing that feature, because over the years that\u2019s been a really handy feature. Sometimes you sit your phone down while talking, or doing things around the house and having the watch Find My Phone feature helps to find it without going into a panic.I\u2019ve had the watch for over a week, now so I\u2019m still learning all the functionalities of it.So I\u2019ll label these Suggestions rather than a negative, because these suggestions would enhance the watch even more.- Make the watch faces more customizable. Or allow for more downloadable faces.  Due to my vision (Keratoconus) I tend to use watch faces with big bold clear numbers, but I also like to see my Calories burned, the day & date, and battery life on the screen.  While this watch comes with a nice selection of faces, I haven\u2019t found a way to edit the features displayed for each face.  There is a widget edit, which changes the info you can view when swiping left and right on the watch.But on the actual watch face, I\u2019d like to remove/change something like the sleep time function on the Home Screen of my first image.  The second image was the first watch face I chose, but it didn\u2019t display the Date, sometimes I have to do paperwork at work & confirm today\u2019s date.\u2022 So add the ability to edit watch faces including color theme.- Another thing: the heart rate monitor is noticeably different from Apple Watch. I have split pictures from my Insanity Workout wearing both watches to compare them.Both watches were in HIIT functions! There\u2019s screen shots taken at different points and you can over time the caloric burn became further and further apart.CMF watch comes with an automatic warm up period, it seems that regardless of the activity the watch has the heart rate at lower level during that warm up period.I say that because Insanity Workout warmups are very intense, typically 3 rounds about 4mins each round and it leaves you dripping sweat during the stretch portion prior to the real workout.  During the warmup my bpm was between 86-117 on CMF, meanwhile on the Apple Watch it was 121-144 bpm.Deep into the HIIT workout (24min) including, power jumps, high knees, moving push-ups, floor mountain climbers CMF watch had my bpm at 92 bpm while the Apple Watch has me at 161 bpm  the caloric burn was 39 calories apart despite 4 mins more on CMF.So at 3:58am :CMF Nothing : 92 bpm, 175 caloriesApple Watch : 161 bpm, 214 caloriesThat made me take two more sets of pictures to compare.So at 4:11am :CMF Nothing: 108 bpm, 250 CaloriesApple Watch:  141 bpm, 355 caloriesSo at 4:44am:CMF Nothing : 107 bpm, 475 caloriesApple Watch : 119 bpm , 599 caloriesThroughout the workout there was a considerable difference in the heart rate readings and caloric burn. I hope they can improve this over time with software updates as it\u2019s a key feature for a user like myself.Still it\u2019s a great watch.",

        "review": "Amaztim T3 Ultra watch is excellent. The software app is good but needs work.Overall. Excellent. iPhone app is good but could be better. Tech support quick to respond with clear answers. Great functionality at low cost.Battery. Outstanding. I have watch set to make health measurements every 5 to 10 minutes. After a 5 day vacation without a charger the battery only dropped to 87%. I wear the watch continuously and only put it on the charger for 30 minutes while in the shower. After 24 hours the battery is at 97% and charges back to 100% in less than 30 min. The charger is a circular flat plate with two small pins. You must align pins. With charging dots on watch. Easy but annoying. Charger plate is magnetic so it holds watch in place. It would be so much better with QI magnetic charging like Apple Watch.Health monitor. Very good. Heart rate, blood oxygen, blood pressure, sleep cycle. I have compared measurements to those in doctor appointments and all came very close. I bought this watch specifically for blood oxygen because Apple watch cannot do it for legal reasons. The only measure missing would be an ECG/EKG heart monitor. The difficulty with the health data is in the Kospet app on iPhone. The app provides data charts but with problems: the plots are not on the same time scale meaning you cannot align and compare the data. For example my heart rate is in the 40s at night, I want to know what my heart rate, blood ox, blood pressure are when I am in deep/light/REM sleep. You cannot do that comparison. The charts are also different style. Heart rate is dense line graph; blood ox is a bar chart that only shows one average data point per hour despite measurements set for every 5 minutes; and, blood pressure is line chart but only displays the last 6 measurements. Again all charts should show all measurements on the same time scale and a comparison chart is needed. Finally, you cannot zoom in on the data and I have not figured out how to download data from app.Support. I have emailed app company several times to ask questions and request the comparison charts. I have received courteous responses within 24 hours (business days only). Questions clearly answered. Very good.Exercise. I have only used Outside Walking which records time, pace etc. Accurate. the GPS and altimeter are very good. I walk the dog through a hilly area and the app shows exactly how many feet you have climbed and descended very nicely. The GPS map is accurate.Phone link. Works quickly. If connection is not made I just close and restart the app to reestablish the connection. Twice in 3 months I had to reset the watch. The phone also displays text messages which is handy. Have to use phone to reply.Controls. The watch controls are displayed by swiping screen up/down/left and closed by down/up/right. The controls are clear and sized for easy adjustment with one finger. I have only used about 40% of controls but the ones I have used are real easy and well organized.Display. Crystal clear. Bright. Vivid colors. Can select watch face display from about 100 options.",

        "review": "Before buying this smart watch I read some negative reviews which I don't believe are justified.  One has to learn how to use this watch and the software on the mobile device.  I found that what some referred to as big problems, such as heart rate measurement, really had to do with proper set up.  I have had this watch for four months now and it is a really good smart watch.  I had a physical the other day and the heart and blood pressure measurements on the watch matched what the doctors office reported.  I like everything about this watch, especially the health monitoring, the watch face options, and the sports management options.  I am an outdoor walker/hiker and the system tracks distance  for me in conjunction with my smart phone.  The watch does a great job tracking steps.I have owned two Garmin watches.  My favorite was the Instinct because it gave me some health measurements and outoor activity tracking, and it was rugged.  It was also much more expensive.  This watch gives me more health measurements and hiking and walking distances (has to work with mobile phone for this feature) and I feel it is just as rugged.  So far, it has proven to be very rugged for the construction work I do.It is a good looking watch and it is comfortable.  I wear it all the time except when I need to charge it.  I need to charge the watch every 16 days.  It charges rather quickly, about 1 hour.  I never let the batter fully drain.I love this watch and I highly recommend it if you want a nice looking, classy, smart watch that performs well and is reasonably priced.",

Usually I can find some scratches on the screen from my old watches the first couple of days after using them but surprisingly that's not the case this time, I've been using it for almost two weeks now and there's no scratches nor damages on the body whatsoever, it still looks brand new after I literally banged it on the door by accident the other day. So I love this sturdy construction design and I think it will last for a long time. Besides that, what really strikes me the most is its functionality, this thing can literally do anything, from time reading, phone calling, steps, sleep and heart rate monitoring, message notifying, even lighting. I can't believe how bright the screen is, it is so bright to the point where I actually used it as a lamp in the middle of the night to find some kleenex. And the battery life is quite impressive as well, I have been using it everyday and it's been 12 days now and I haven't charged it once. It's truly remarkable. Overall, it's an excellent watch and it is reasonably priced. I would say this is the best bang for the buck, to be honest I'm actually thinking of getting another one for my wife.",

I have no problem reading it in the Arizona sun. The colors are vivid and lines are crisp. The display detects wrist tilt and turns on and off reliably when you lift your arm to read it. It syncs with my phone reliably and I get notifications on it as well. It was a bit of a pain to sort out the app permissions, but once that was done it works well. You can configure your home screen pages to include shortcuts to favorite activities, stats, music controls, timers, etc. There's a wide variety of faces available from minimalist to information overload. Battery life is great, with 5-7 days being standard for me. The factory strap is a bit of a pain to put on, but it uses standard watch straps with quick release pins, so any generic 22mm strap should fit. Heart rate and SpO2 monitoring seem accurate, and it detects activity well. There are a couple things I wish were different. Weight and height are in metric only, so if you're tracking weight loss you'll need to convert each time. The contacts for phone calls don't work. I can see my contacts, but the watch is unable to use them to dial a call. Manual keypad dialing does work though, oddly enough. There is no auto brightness on this model, so it can be a bit bright in dark rooms. It will sync night mode with local sunrise and sunset though, which helps. There are some cool geared/steampunk style mechanical faces available, but they are static. Outside of analog hand movement, there are no animations available. Overall, this offers a lot of functionality and is a solid choice at a great price point.",

It's very easy to use and set up. My main reason for getting this watch was for running. I tested this product for a week, and due to my needs, it was not sufficient (aka tracking my run).In regards to running, it took a while to acquire the GPS, and while running, I was consistently notified of a 'low signal'. I have a running partner, and we would compare our data, and it was not the same. The majority of my runs will track the mileage, but it cannot track the location (aka provide the map visual [Strava]) due to the 'low signal'. Also, if you are from the US, this device uses the metric system (e.g., kilometers), and you cannot change it (I tried). Due to this, I returned the device.Overall, I would recommend it for the day-to-day and basic health tracking, but NOT for those who are active and track mileage.",

The biggest issues I have with this Military watch is 1- No real-time heart rate, just snap shots. 2- Inaccurate heart rate. 3- Repeatedly loosing workout data:(. 4- Randomly powering off 5- Inaccurate calorie counter. 6- You have to remember to start and end your workout otherwise it does not track it. 7- It only lasted three months before the heart rate monitor stopped working. 8- you have to manually sync with the app. 9- The app data is severely lacking. 9- The sleep data for some reason only starts at midnight. What good is that? The sleep data is archaic when compared to the Fitbit. The watch will randomly power off. You have to either hold both buttons for 20 seconds or attach the charger to get it to power back on. If it powers down ALL DATA IS LOST. This happened numerous times and it erased all workouts since the last time that I synced with the App. The app is very generic and offers little insight. Syncing with google fit adds some added features. I can\u2019t recommend this watch to anyone. Waste of money! the few benefits include the light and long battery life however you need to remember that the long battery life come at a cost. (no active heart rate or syncing)",

Everything else on your iPhone works in slow motion. Especially speech to text. I don\u2019t think it knows where to go. To the phone or the watch. The heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen. Are a waste of time. Not even close to accurate. Blood pressure is not even within range. O2/oxygen always just reads 99%. My oxygen is within 93/97% never 99. Haven\u2019t decided if I will return it yet. Nice looking watch. The way too much that doesn\u2019t work on it.",

Comes with three, which is great because I'm sure I'll scratch them up eventually.Overall, pleasantly surprised with how good this product is, given the current lack of reviews.

        "review": "I have a multi-horned demon on my wrist staring out of the screen at me of the EarlySincere T13 Advanced GPT AI Smart Watch. I created him using the 'Da Fit' app once I paired it with my watch. I had so much fun doing this and I hope they keep expanding awesome features like this to make the watch even \"sticker\" for those that have it.The screen itself is gorgeous, and I like the smooth animations used with the various functions of the watch. ChatGPT is incorporated for anyone who needs that, and while I currently don't use it, it's good to know that that functionality is there.One thing I DIDN'T enjoy was the watch strap. While beautiful, the strap itself is annoying to use. Since it isn't long enough, I can't keep it closed as it doesn't slide over my hand. This means I have to unthread it and rethread it whenever I want to take it off or put it on. Just now I had to fumble with it with one hand and it was a struggle to get the magnetized end threaded correctly into the slot. The end is a bit too thick to make for easy insertion.Did I say it was annoying?Hopefully a solution will be incorporated into a future edition of this model, because I LOVE the strength of the magnets, and it really holds the strap together on my wrist even during vigorous physical activity.I'd also prefer to have a watch with its own onboard GPS (which this one doesn't have) as opposed to using the smartphone GPS system (this helps with the hit on battery life for the phone, which we never seem to have enough of. Better to use watch GPS instead)This watch also responds quicker than any other I've tried in waking up when I turn my wrist. No more delayed response as with other brands, I can get at my information in an instant. With the strap being the only ding against this otherwise excellent and powerful smart watch. I can recommend this as a solid piece of tech, especially for those with smaller wrists.",

All these things and more make the great watch a beneficial and versatile device if you are seeking to enhance your well-being and daily life. I love the convenience of enhanced connectivity. I can get my notifications at a glance, get calls, messages and alerts from apps to stay connected with no need to check my phone all the time. Not only that, but I appreciate hands-free control to send messages, make calls, and control any smart home devices using my voice commands: a useful feature when my hands are busy. Getting quick information on the go is much appreciated. I can play music directly from my wrist. Set-up was a cinch. Comprehensive health and wellness monitoring is a wonderful feature, although I haven\u2019t taken the time to get real familiar with that aspect. Doubt I\u2019d ever use it for sleep tracking, but it might be something beneficial to you. The device lives up to its reputation as a smartwatch with an ability for early disease detection. Wow! It monitors changes by keeping track of vital signs to detect possible health conditions from patterns, like irregular heart rhythms and vital signs. The watch with AI can even create a training plan for you. I like that it is dust tight, waterproof. Nice to be caught in the rain wearing it without concern. It\u2019s got a snazzy visual appeal. From personal experience, AI is able to learn your preferences and habits to give you suggestions and insights tailored to your needs for daily routines, fitness, and health.",

I would characterize it as more of a watch that does some extra things. Not as fitness item that happens to have a watch. I know that is a subtle distinction, and I hope it makes sense. For what he likes, it is a great compromise.Foremost, it looks like a watch. It is still sporty-looking, but does look like a more traditional watch in its display and styling. It has a tick-type second hand, not a sweep on its display. The battery life is not good. We don't have any other similar items to compare it with, but it seems like any item like this should last all day with typical use. I mean, I understand if you are using a lot of the software and things it may be shorter, but I just wish it would work for 12+ hours with average use.It does work with Alexa, but not google. We use a lot of alexa items so it is okay for our house, but yours may be different. It works well with my son's Apple phone which isn't always the case with things that are supposed to work with both Apple and Android.Is this the most fitness-centric wearable you can have? No, not at all. But as a watch that has some fitness added features, it is good. It doesn't look like you are wearing some monitor, but more like a watch. The band is also easy to change if you want to get a leather one (this one is silicone) to make it even more watch-like. For a sort of hybrid item, it is very good.",

        "review": "I have a multi-horned demon on my wrist staring out of the screen at me of the EarlySincere T13 Advanced GPT AI Smart Watch. I created him using the 'Da Fit' app once I paired it with my watch. I had so much fun doing this and I hope they keep expanding awesome features like this to make the watch even \"sticker\" for those that have it.The screen itself is gorgeous, and I like the smooth animations used with the various functions of the watch. ChatGPT is incorporated for anyone who needs that, and while I currently don't use it, it's good to know that that functionality is there.One thing I DIDN'T enjoy was the watch strap. While beautiful, the strap itself is annoying to use. Since it isn't long enough, I can't keep it closed as it doesn't slide over my hand. This means I have to unthread it and rethread it whenever I want to take it off or put it on. Just now I had to fumble with it with one hand and it was a struggle to get the magnetized end threaded correctly into the slot. The end is a bit too thick to make for easy insertion.Did I say it was annoying?Hopefully a solution will be incorporated into a future edition of this model, because I LOVE the strength of the magnets, and it really holds the strap together on my wrist even during vigorous physical activity.I'd also prefer to have a watch with its own onboard GPS (which this one doesn't have) as opposed to using the smartphone GPS system (this helps with the hit on battery life for the phone, which we never seem to have enough of. Better to use watch GPS instead)This watch also responds quicker than any other I've tried in waking up when I turn my wrist. No more delayed response as with other brands, I can get at my information in an instant. With the strap being the only ding against this otherwise excellent and powerful smart watch. I can recommend this as a solid piece of tech, especially for those with smaller wrists.",

All these things and more make the great watch a beneficial and versatile device if you are seeking to enhance your well-being and daily life. I love the convenience of enhanced connectivity. I can get my notifications at a glance, get calls, messages and alerts from apps to stay connected with no need to check my phone all the time. Not only that, but I appreciate hands-free control to send messages, make calls, and control any smart home devices using my voice commands: a useful feature when my hands are busy. Getting quick information on the go is much appreciated. I can play music directly from my wrist. Set-up was a cinch. Comprehensive health and wellness monitoring is a wonderful feature, although I haven\u2019t taken the time to get real familiar with that aspect. Doubt I\u2019d ever use it for sleep tracking, but it might be something beneficial to you. The device lives up to its reputation as a smartwatch with an ability for early disease detection. Wow! It monitors changes by keeping track of vital signs to detect possible health conditions from patterns, like irregular heart rhythms and vital signs. The watch with AI can even create a training plan for you. I like that it is dust tight, waterproof. Nice to be caught in the rain wearing it without concern. It\u2019s got a snazzy visual appeal. From personal experience, AI is able to learn your preferences and habits to give you suggestions and insights tailored to your needs for daily routines, fitness, and health.",

        "review": "This is a beautiful watch, and is comfortable to wear. However, the app software and connectivity with this watch is incredibly clunky to, say the least. With other smartwatches (including the cheap ones), the connectivity is seamless. You can connect to a new phone or device quickly and efficiently, but not with this watch. Anytime you want connect to a new device, you have to factory reset the watch and have to start over. If there is a way to switch devices where I don't have I do that, I couldn't find it, and I scoured through the watch and the app, to no avail. All the custom faces and specific options are just gone. Then, after the reset, it takes the app a bit to even get the options back that it had before resetting. As I said, it's clunky and not nearly up to the same level as other smartwatch platforms. My recommendation for Citizen is to put some work into your app and save account data so transitioning your watch from device to device isn't such a pain. When I see the name Citizen on a watch, I expect the highest quality, precision, style, and functionality. Let's face it, their Ecodrive watches are sweet! However, this experience with their smartwatch app/software makes it feel like they rushed this out of product testing without it fully being ready to actually go. I know the new trend seems to be going to smartwatches instead of the traditional ones, but if you're going to be competitive in this particular market, you need to have an app that'll compete too.So grading wise:Style: A+Battery life: C- (have to charge every night.. not the biggest deal but other smartwatches can last significantly longer aka days to weeks)App/software: FFunctionality once you get through the app woes: A- to B+I believe in Citizen and I know they can improve on this product as time goes on. I wouldn't say \"buyer beware\" but maybe wait until this one is on sale.",

        "review": "This watch says Citizen, but it is a Fossil through and through. (Fossil Gen 6, to be specific) This watch is incredibly frustrating to use. Input lag is horrible, and heaven forbid if you\u2019re downloading something when you want to interact with the watch. It literally freezes up. Downloads are painfully slow, and 50% of the time, remote installs via Play Store do not process on the watch. I\u2019ve yet to see more than 5 hours of battery life before the watch switches to extended mode.Watch faces are gimped because they have \u201ccurated\u201d your customization options. So the background color and other colors change in unison \u2013 you have no granularity. No dark blue with white text for you. Citizen has decided that is no \u201con brand\u201d apparently.Calendar does not sync with anything, regardless of the setup process. So, the built-in calendar apps are useless. Google pay no longer exists, so it updated to Google Wallet. This is fine, but when you try to configure a default payment, it wants to use Google Pay through Google Wallet.This really isn\u2019t rocket science. If you\u2019re going to go \u201call-in\u201d with Wear OS, then do that. This hybrid environment masquerading as Wear OS is broken and inefficient. For what this device costs, the experience should be on par with a Galaxy Watch or an Apple Watch. This isn\u2019t TicWatch or Amazfit \u2013 people are willing to make allowances for user experience at their prices, though, to be fair, they \u201cget it\u201d when it comes to UX, generally speaking.Bottom line, if you\u2019re looking for a smartwatch in a more traditional watch casing, this isn\u2019t it.",

Wash your hands, wipe the surface with a piece of the wet cloth, dry with the provided cloth. If there's no dust on the surface remove tab #1 and position it. While bending the protector back towards you, slowly move it forward, the remaining piece of plastic on the back will peel off as you go forward. This left me with a couple small air bubbles near the edges, which were easy to press out using my finger/included little board. If you get dust under the protector, you can't press that out so it's important to start applying as soon as you see the watch surface is free of contaminants. I'm happy it went so well the first time. Hopefully it will stay on and not come off easily.",

        "review": "This smartwatch puts Fitbit to shame. Talk about great value for the money! My $200+ Fitbit lasted exactly 20 months before it died, with no support from Fitbit. The interface on this watch is much more user friendly than the high priced competitor, the screen is easy to read and it was super easy to set up and sync with my iPhone using the Fitdock app. It is also fully compatible with Apple Health app. The 41mm looks great on my tiny wrist and data seems to be quite accurate. The quality is excellent, the screen is big enough to provide all the information needed with the touch of a user friendly button. Although you can\u2019t use it like a Dick Tracy wrist phone and talk into it,, you can get message notifications from your phone. I sweat when I work and it does not seem to affect performance at all; it is very comfortable to wear. The battery lasts for days! I am most impressed with this watch! Don\u2019t spend a fortune on a smart watch, try this one first. It would make a great gift as well. At this price you could give one to friends and family and they will think you spent a ton of money on them!",

        "review": "I have had this watch for a few months now. I think its amazing, especially for the price. I used to be a big fan of Fitbit, but the product quality went down over the years which got me looking into alternatives, where i found this one. I really only wanted the sleep and step trackers, so i have the wakeup gesture and notifications turned off;which makes it so i only have to charge it every other month! I did have an allergic reaction to the silicone band that it came with, but it was an easy fix. I've found that the fabric bands made for the style of the Fitbit Versa Lite fit perfectly. And honestly, the fact that i can customize the wallpaper with no charge... cherry on the top!!",

        "review": "It\u2019s a decent watch for the money. The step tracker seems accurate as well as the sleep tracking, and the interface is easy to use. My biggest gripe is that the heart rate sensor is not at all accurate as soon as you start sweating. Which is one of the major reasons why I bought the watch to track my heart rate during my workouts. As soon as you stop actively sweating and the sensor dries off slightly it goes back to working accurately.",

I've had a fit bit and a Gorman but after a while the battery dies and they're done. This is fine at the much cheaper price. It does so much. Good for me and looks good too.",
