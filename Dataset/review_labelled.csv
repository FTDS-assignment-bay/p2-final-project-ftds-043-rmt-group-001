Amazfit Bip 6,"I purchased this watch to replace a dead Samsung Galaxy watch.I've been pleasantly surprised with the functionality for the price. This watch will display and respond to messages, answer calls, track workouts, and more. I'm extremely surprised by the battery life. Wearing this watch for a week and the battery is only 50%. No more charging every night. A long with the great features you get a stylish and comfortable watch.

Amazfit Bip 6,"Pleasantly surprised. Finally, a less expensive watch that does everything, and more, than my Fitbit did. It has all the features I used on Fitbit for half the cost. The battery is better as well. I also like the larger face size. Being able to customize the watch face to my specific needs was essential, and I can do this with this watch. I did have to buy a program to do that, but it was well worth the $20. Facemaker is the name of the program if other's want to do the same. I get a full week use out of the battery with 4 1 hour (average) workouts a week. I actually have about 20% left at the 1 week point. Heart rate seems to be accurate, although it only checks it once a minute (settable in the app). For workouts it seems to display heart rate in real time which I care about more than when I am not working out. The app that the watch uses is pretty good. It actually provides a LOT more information than I care about. The only thing I have found that I wish was better is having the ability to edit the workout face. You can edit the data and where that data displays, but you can't edit the size of each data display. I would really like to be able to do this. Even better would be the ability to edit the workout face in the app, as opposed to only on the watch. I have only had this a couple of weeks so there may be more I discover that I like or dislike. I will update if needed, but for now I can fully recommend this watch as a valid replacement for much higher priced watches.",5.0,Positive,"['pleasantly', 'surprise', 'finally', 'less', 'expensive', 'watch', 'everything', 'fitbit', 'feature', 'use', 'fitbit', 'half', 'cost', 'battery', 'well', 'well', 'also', 'like', 'large', 'face', 'size', 'able', 'customize', 'watch', 'face', 'specific', 'need', 'essential', 'watch', 'buy', 'program', 'well', 'worth', 'facemaker', 'name', 'program', 'others', 'want', 'get', 'full', 'week', 'use', 'battery', 'hour', 'average', 'workouts', 'week', 'actually', 'leave', 'week', 'point', 'heart', 'rate', 'seem', 'accurate', 'although', 'check', 'minute', 'settable', 'application', 'workout', 'seem', 'display', 'heart', 'rate', 'real', 'time', 'care', 'work', 'application', 'watch', 'use', 'pretty', 'good', 'actually', 'provide', 'lot', 'information', 'care', 'thing', 'find', 'wish', 'good', 'ability', 'edit', 'workout', 'face', 'edit', 'data', 'data', 'display', 'cant', 'edit', 'size', 'data', 'display', 'would', 'really', 'like', 'able', 'even', 'well', 'would', 'ability', 'edit', 'workout', 'face', 'application', 'oppose', 'watch', 'couple', 'week', 'may', 'discover', 'like', 'dislike', 'update', 'need', 'fully', 'recommend', 'watch', 'valid', 'replacement', 'much', 'high', 'price', 'watch']",pleasantly surprise finally less expensive watch everything fitbit feature use fitbit half cost battery well well also like large face size able customize watch face specific need essential watch buy program well worth facemaker name program others want get full week use battery hour average workouts week actually leave week point heart rate seem accurate although check minute settable application workout seem display heart rate real time care work application watch use pretty good actually provide lot information care thing find wish good ability edit workout face edit data data display cant edit size data display would really like able even well would ability edit workout face application oppose watch couple week may discover like dislike update need fully recommend watch valid replacement much high price watch
Amazfit Bip 6,"If you’re looking to purchase a smart watch that is affordable and it has all the bills and whistles other smart watches have then check this out. If you have an android or an iPhone, no worries this watch is actually compatible with both. You can also monitor your heart rate, steps taken and so much more. Setting up the watch is really easy and they connect via Bluetooth. Since I love working out, this is one of the features that I really enjoyed. It has more than 140 workouts something that the other smart watches do not have and it’s at a fraction of the cost, which makes it even better. There’s also an app that you can download that allows you to monitor your food intake. One of the great functions that this watch has is the ability to make and receive phone calls as well as text messages. A battery life on the watch is amazing. You can get up to 14 days depending on your usage.

Amazfit Bip 6,"This watch does well, considered the price. The functions and capabilities are pretty good. The watch face is a nice size for those who need larger texts. The band width is a bit snug. I wish they'd offer larger bands. My major squarm is the battery life when active. The watch has to be charged every four days. My Fitbit would last well over a week before it needed a charge. I do like that you can text and answer calls from your arm. The charging port could be a bit more user convenient. It was simple to connect this watch to my Android; it's compatible.

Amazfit Bip 6,"This watch is amazing quality for the price! I have smart watches from all the major competitors and this one is actually better than all of them. The long battery life is a huge reason why I love this watch. I have had it on for weeks and it’s still at 1/2 battery level. It’s functional and has everything that you could want in a smart watch, and more. You can get all your notifications on this watch, GPS, make phone calls, and send replies. It has so many health tracking features like different workout modes, sleep metrics, blood oxygen, stress, and heart rate. It’s user friendly and easy to see notifications on the display, even in bright daylight. It is water resistant and very durable. I tend to break the screen of my other watches and this one is holding up strong! It even offers AI coaching for fitness. You can choose from tons of face watches to match your personal style. The screen size looks a little large for my small wrist but it doesn’t feel bulky when on. Overall this watch is amazing.

Amazfit Active 2,"This thing blows away the Fitbit Versa 2, and the Garmin.  Very quick and easy to set up.  Quite accurate with your steps, which is important to me.  Heart rate is on point, and there are tons of extra features.  You can set it up for almost any type of exercise that you do.  From walking on the treadmill, to walking outside.  Running, strength training, lap swimming, elliptical, rowing machine, you name it.  The weather is accurate on this as well.  It's just a beautiful watch.  For the rest of us, we don't need that Apple watch with the high price tag.  This watch is superior, and the price is right.  Another bonus, the charge lasts for days.  I need to charge mine tonight, after not charging it for 9 days.  This brand will forever be my go to.  I research EVERYTHING thoroughly, and after having bought a Garmin to give it a go, that thing was a hunk of junk.  I came across this one, read the reviews, and felt confident with my purchase.

Amazfit Active 2,"I bought this watch in black when I started getting into fitness and wanted to track my sleep and workouts - and honestly, I’m really impressed! It looks so elegant on the wrist, and the quality feels amazing.There are so many useful features - one workout function alone has multiple training modes where you can track calories, plus detailed sleep tracking, notifications, and even a flashlight. I didn’t expect it to be this good - it truly feels like a quality purchase.The watch face is a bit on the larger side, so it feels slightly more masculine and may be better suited for men - but I still really enjoy using it. Even though it’s a bit big for me, the strap adjusts perfectly and makes it comfortable to wear.Funny enough, I forgot I had it on and accidentally took a shower with it - but nothing happened!

Amazfit Active 2,"Great smartwatch that is easy to navigate and responsive to touch.  It is very lightweight which was a little worrisome.  My previous smartwatch was a Garmin Fenix 6 which is heavier and rugged.  It looks great, has a bright screen, and paired easily with my Google Pixel 6 Pro phone.  The only concerns/issues I have are: (1) because the watch is so lightweight, I'm concerned about it durability...definitely would not wear it in the garage while fixing things; (2) when paired with Pandora music app, the watch vibrates/notifies me every time the song changes no matter if its via my phone or car...I hope that maybe a setting change can fix this.

Amazfit T-Rex 3,"So far, after using the watch for a week now, I am impressed.  I've used other smart watches and this has been the best so far.  Seems some of the difficulties I've experienced with watches in the past are better with this T Rex 3.BT connectivity is better. No issues linking up to my phone.  And when loosing connectivity due to distance or such, the watch and the Zepp app seem to reconnect very well.  I do not, and have not had to go through any BT reconnect process since my first pairing.The heart rate monitor seems much more reliable than other watches.  The sleep pattern and logging of such seems very accurate and reliable as well.  As with most watches, lots of functions and apps I'll never use, but the ones I do use, seem to work well.I like the excersize tracker functions.  One of the features I never thought about, but once playing around with it, I have found it very useful in incorporating into my routine.I did notice the compass and GPS all seemed to calibrate and function much quicker and with more accuracy with this T Rex 3.  I was pleased with that result.  The mapping feature is working and kind of interesting.  Not a feature I've used before, but can see where it could be worthy of trying.The ability to use phone, SMS and such works well, with replies and messaging working well paired with my Samsung Galaxy.In general, typical features found on this watch all seem to work as advertised.  The Zepp app has many, many features which seem to be interesting, but haven't yet played around with.  No issues with downloading or pairing or data updates from the watch.  All in all, seems like Amazfit and Zepp work very well together.As with most smart watches, the navigation through its apps and functions can be ""trial and err"", but I find this watch to be very near others and no more difficult while being and very similar to others.  The Zepp app can be intrusive with permission requests and such, but always having, and giving  the option to allow or deny.  All depends on what the user finds useful or not.Watch itself is very lite on my wrist.  I'm not a big fan of the band, more like a plastic, silicone band, but works fine, just not my preference.  Display is very nice and bright, clear and crisp. Battery seems to be working as advertised as well.

Amazfit T-Rex 3,"First of all, I used to work for a major smartwatch company (which will remain nameless) writing manufacturing test software and running the data analytics team.  Thus, I was very much involved in the device data set uploaded to the cloud and the creation of device diagnostics, usability, and user preference analytics for our marketing and engineering departments.  From this point of view, I was very intimate with all the internal device components and how our devices were utilized by our users.I would have to say that this T-Rex3 watch blows away any of the smartwatches I have seen in my previous company at a reasonable price point.  It even has more comprehensive feature set than I have seen on my Garmin Venu 2 which I use everyday for my workouts.  I wore both the Venu 2 and T-Rex3 on a long hike and the health and workout numbers were very close.  Been using this Venu 2 for 4 years now almost everyday and I consider this to be the gold standard for GPS accuracy.I cannot stress how much battery longevity is a high priority to me as I know many users do not want to charge their devices daily as people forget and it is a hassle.  I personally make my smartwatch purchase decision starting with how long the battery will last.  BTW, I also owned an Apple Watch in the past and I stopped using it as I would forget to charge it daily, rendering it useless to me.Pros- Excellent battery life, almost 2 weeks using the GPS daily every day for at least 1 hour in myworkouts.  I believe the battery can run longer without such heavy GPS usage.-  Cost to own.  You will not find a better, more comprehensive smartwatch at this price point.-  I have proven its GPS and health feature set accuracy-  I like that it can capture Beidou GPS signals as I travel to Asia frequently-  Large high resolution color screen for my old eyes to see everything clearly-  Comprehensive set of watch faces, some free but some you must purchase-  Comfortable enough for me to wear 24/7 to enable me to collect sleep data-  Most of the settings and features like notifications are pretty standard for today's smartwatches-  Durability of this device to meet military standards suggests it should last...time will tellCons- It is a large watch, but it fits me.  42mm is my ideal size, but some may find it too big.- Very functional design, not the prettiest, but also not the ugliest- Appeals primarily to men which locks out 50% of the market who wants this feature set- Zepp app is average at best.  For instance, I cannot track the mileage on my running shoes like on theGarmin app.  I still like the Garmin app better.",5.0,Positive,"['first', 'use', 'work', 'major', 'smartwatch', 'company', 'remain', 'nameless', 'write', 'manufacture', 'test', 'software', 'run', 'data', 'analytics', 'team', 'thus', 'much', 'involved', 'device', 'data', 'set', 'upload', 'cloud', 'creation', 'device', 'diagnostics', 'usability', 'user', 'preference', 'analytics', 'market', 'engineering', 'department', 'point', 'view', 'intimate', 'internal', 'device', 'component', 'device', 'utilized', 'usersi', 'would', 'say', 'trex', 'watch', 'blow', 'away', 'smartwatches', 'see', 'previous', 'company', 'reasonable', 'price', 'point', 'even', 'comprehensive', 'feature', 'set', 'see', 'garmin', 'venu', 'use', 'everyday', 'workout', 'wear', 'venu', 'trex', 'long', 'hike', 'health', 'workout', 'number', 'close', 'use', 'venu', 'year', 'almost', 'everyday', 'consider', 'gold', 'standard', 'global positioning system', 'accuracyi', 'stress', 'much', 'battery', 'longevity', 'high', 'priority', 'know', 'many', 'user', 'want', 'charge', 'device', 'daily', 'people', 'forget', 'hassle', 'personally', 'make', 'smartwatch', 'purchase', 'decision', 'start', 'long', 'battery', 'last', 'by the way', 'also', 'own', 'apple', 'watch', 'past', 'stop', 'use', 'would', 'forget', 'charge', 'daily', 'render', 'useless', 'mepros', 'excellent', 'battery', 'life', 'almost', 'week', 'use', 'global positioning system', 'daily', 'every', 'day', 'least', 'hour', 'myworkouts', 'believe', 'battery', 'run', 'longer', 'without', 'heavy', 'global positioning system', 'usage', 'cost', 'find', 'well', 'comprehensive', 'smartwatch', 'price', 'point', 'proven', 'global positioning system', 'health', 'feature', 'set', 'accuracy', 'like', 'capture', 'beidou', 'global positioning system', 'signal', 'travel', 'asia', 'frequently', 'large', 'high', 'resolution', 'color', 'screen', 'old', 'eye', 'see', 'everything', 'clearly', 'comprehensive', 'set', 'watch', 'face', 'free', 'must', 'purchase', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'wear', 'enable', 'collect', 'sleep', 'data', 'setting', 'feature', 'like', 'notification', 'pretty', 'standard', 'today', 'smartwatches', 'durability', 'device', 'meet', 'military', 'standard', 'suggest', 'lasttime', 'tellcons', 'large', 'watch', 'fit', 'mm', 'ideal', 'size', 'may', 'find', 'big', 'functional', 'design', 'prettiest', 'also', 'ugly', 'appeal', 'primarily', 'men', 'lock', 'market', 'want', 'feature', 'set', 'zepp', 'application', 'average', 'best', 'instance', 'track', 'mileage', 'run', 'shoe', 'like', 'thegarmin', 'application', 'still', 'like', 'garmin', 'application', 'well']",first use work major smartwatch company remain nameless write manufacture test software run data analytics team thus much involved device data set upload cloud creation device diagnostics usability user preference analytics market engineering department point view intimate internal device component device utilized usersi would say trex watch blow away smartwatches see previous company reasonable price point even comprehensive feature set see garmin venu use everyday workout wear venu trex long hike health workout number close use venu year almost everyday consider gold standard global positioning system accuracyi stress much battery longevity high priority know many user want charge device daily people forget hassle personally make smartwatch purchase decision start long battery last by the way also own apple watch past stop use would forget charge daily render useless mepros excellent battery life almost week use global positioning system daily every day least hour myworkouts believe battery run longer without heavy global positioning system usage cost find well comprehensive smartwatch price point proven global positioning system health feature set accuracy like capture beidou global positioning system signal travel asia frequently large high resolution color screen old eye see everything clearly comprehensive set watch face free must purchase comfortable enough wear enable collect sleep data setting feature like notification pretty standard today smartwatches durability device meet military standard suggest lasttime tellcons large watch fit mm ideal size may find big functional design prettiest also ugly appeal primarily men lock market want feature set zepp application average best instance track mileage run shoe like thegarmin application still like garmin application well

Amazfit Active 2,"I’ve been using this smartwatch for a few weeks now, and I’m truly impressed. The design is sleek and elegant, with a classic watch face that makes it look like a luxury timepiece rather than a typical smartwatch. The black strap is comfortable and adjustable, and the display is clear and easy to read even in daylight.I love how it shows both the analog and digital time, and it even displays the date clearly. The interface is responsive, and syncing with my phone was fast and easy. I mainly use it to track my steps, check messages, and keep an eye on the time — and it does all of that reliably.Battery life has been great so far — it lasts several days on a single charge.

Amazfit Active 2,"Why did you pick this product vs others?:​I already own the amazfit active midnight black and i love it. But when i saw that this came out with the Sapphire glass and stainless steel bezel i had to have it. It is so beautiful and strong. Very good quality, nice leather band and very nice red sports band comes with it. The only thing is that the battery runs out too soon. I actually disabled several things so it could last upto 10 days. . The watch faces that come with this watch are so beautiful. It is has a bright screen and looks very good. Very affordable, very comfortable. Heart rate and sleep and other apps work very well. The only things i would change about it is a longer lasting battery and at least upto 2gbs of storage space (comes with 1gb storage) to add more stuff in the watch like music and watch faces.

Amazfit Active 2,"I went with the leather band and higher quality glass and I’m glad I did.  It looks great and much more high end than it is.  There are many more free watch faces than Fitbit ever offered.  The design is classic and timeless which is a must for me.I really wanted to LOVE this watch after wearing Fitbits for years.  I just like it.  That’s because the battery life isn’t close to the 10 day claim.  Have to charge it just as often as my Fitbits and when it gets low it’s just GONE.The number of apps is overwhelming!  That could be a good thing until you realize that every app significantly shortens battery life.

Amazfit Active 2,"Prior to this smartwatch, I was an Apple Watch or whoop only user. I HATED that I couldn’t get 24 hours of use on the Apple Watch to track sleep and other health monitoring and hated not getting notifications from whoop.

Amazfit Active 2,"Was hoping amazfit would come out with an elegant watch, so jumped at the chance to buy this when it came out. I own two other amazfit watches. The functionality this watch offer is quite, well, amazing, especially for the price. The problem is look and feel. The stainless steel does not look like stainless steel at all, but rather powder coated material of unknown composition. The glass bezel has a strange curve to it, which makes it look spacey, kind of Google pixel like. Some people may like that, but the glass has some kind of strange coating that makes it look cloudy all the time. You can wipe it off, but it’ll look cloudy again quickly, and it holds finger oils terribly.  This causes a weird reflection off the glass.  The leather band is thin and cheap. It is also quite narrow. overall good concept here just poor execution.",3.0,Neutral,"['hop', 'amazfit', 'would', 'come', 'elegant', 'watch', 'jump', 'chance', 'buy', 'come', 'two', 'amazfit', 'watch', 'functionality', 'watch', 'offer', 'quite', 'well', 'amaze', 'especially', 'price', 'problem', 'look', 'feel', 'stainless', 'steel', 'look', 'like', 'stainless', 'steel', 'rather', 'powder', 'coat', 'material', 'unknown', 'composition', 'glass', 'bezel', 'strange', 'curve', 'make', 'look', 'spacey', 'kind', 'google', 'pixel', 'like', 'people', 'may', 'like', 'glass', 'kind', 'strange', 'coating', 'make', 'look', 'cloudy', 'time', 'wipe', 'itll', 'look', 'cloudy', 'quickly', 'hold', 'finger', 'oil', 'terribly', 'cause', 'weird', 'reflection', 'glass', 'leather', 'band', 'thin', 'cheap', 'also', 'quite', 'narrow', 'overall', 'good', 'concept', 'poor', 'execution']",hop amazfit would come elegant watch jump chance buy come two amazfit watch functionality watch offer quite well amaze especially price problem look feel stainless steel look like stainless steel rather powder coat material unknown composition glass bezel strange curve make look spacey kind google pixel like people may like glass kind strange coating make look cloudy time wipe itll look cloudy quickly hold finger oil terribly cause weird reflection glass leather band thin cheap also quite narrow overall good concept poor execution

Amazfit Gtr Mini Smart Watch,"I have had this watch for a few months at this point. I have used a ton of different cheaper watches, and the accompanying apps. This one by far is beyond the others. First the watch faces are customizable you can use a large variety of free ones, you can purchase more in the app or you can use the custom watch face builder to create your own. The tracking of everything works well. I don't use any of the paid services, but there is plenty of information available for someone who is mildly interested in tracking sleep quality, steps, exercise, water consumption, activity levels, etc. More importantly for me, it sends me notifications, answers calls, has voice assistant, and tracks all of the above. It stays charged for an entire workweek. I charge it on my day off when I am just relaxing, then I am good to wear it consistently for the next week. I have eyed the pixel watch on and off, but the darn higher end watches don't stay charged long enough. So if you are not looking for a doctor on your wrist that gives perfectly accurate data this is a good choice. It seems pretty accurate for what I use it for, and I don't base medical decisions off the data, other than maybe saying I don't think I am getting enough sleep sometimes. If the pixel watch eventually can match battery life might try that out someday, but until then this is the brand for me. Oh and unlike all the other cheaper ones, this app stays connected and reconnects when it is back in range, I never lose my sleep or steps data because I forgot to link the app at exactly 11:59 at night, or ever. The only time I don't get data is when I am not wearing the watch.***update April 2025***This watch is still working fantastically. I work in a commercial kitchen, I am sometimes elbow deep in a sink full of dishes or covered to my elbows in degreaser, oil, sanitizer, or food of some sort. When I am just prepping food I will usually pull my glove up over the watch, but otherwise it is exposed to the abuse of the elements in the kitchen. Most of the watches I have used before seem to fall apart after a few months in the kitchen. I think some of the chemicals we use dissolve the glue that holds the face to the body of the watch. This one still looks brand new. There is a warning somewhere in the instructions to not expose this to prolonged hot water, the thing is I can't stop what I am doing to take my watch off, so I had resigned myself to just purchasing new watches when the old one broke. And if this one eventually falls apart I will replace it with the newest model of the exact same watch. The app for this watch just works. It tries to sell me upgrades every couple weeks but they aren't necessary to keep track of steps or sleep or anything else really. It still connects automatically whenever in range of my phone, and I do not have to think about it at all. I can ignore the app for weeks at a time and still go back and look at the data whenever I want. And when I am feeling like I want something new I just switch out the band.

Amazfit Gtr Mini Smart Watch,"Pros:1. Sleep tracking is nice and more than I expected. It provides daily trends on sleep habits, including the time frames of REM, Deep Sleep and Light Sleep (all shown in separate parts in the same graph). Love this, and didn't expect I would use it, but I do. It reminds me to go to bed based on a goal. Provides sleep grades compared to others and this goal. And it has been successful in helping me track my overall sleep health, and to develop better sleep habits. This was an unexpected perk for me.2. Setup of the watch and the Zepp app was so much more painless than the initial watch I purchased and its app. It synced up quickly and correctly. The app started reporting, and transferring over to the Apple Health app right away once I got it all set up. It did take some figuring out how to get the Apple Health synced up, but that was a complexity issue more on the Apple side.3. The battery life is really good. I typically only have to charge every 3-4 days. Am very happy with the battery life considering how much I use the watch.4. The watch provides a wide array of health stats including the already described Sleep, Stress, Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen, Steps, Activities, Exercise, Calories, distance, and provides a PAI score each day that took a little to understand, but I now find very useful to just ""summarize"" if I'm staying active and healthy each day. I especially love the blood oxygen reading which I track every hour because I suffer from asthma that is allergy and autoimmune-related. I can now track when I might need to pay closer attention and ""take a puff"" before it gets really bad. I don't know how accurate this all is, but the readings make enough sense to be useful in tracking my overall systematic health, and I find that very useful overall.5. I know I have only ""unlocked"" and used half of this watch and Zepp watch's abilities. There is also geolocation capacities, which I look forward to using on a hike or outdoor activities.6. I also like the tap button on the side, and the many possibly configurations you can set up to customize how you interact with the watch. It's easy to push because it sticks out, unlike some other smartwatches that you have to push just right. I use my tap button for 1) short tap to access all the apps (and you can buy or download free apps - this is also nice), 2) long tap to wake my watch. I just love the flexibility in setting up the watch to fit your own needs and preferences.7. My texts and messages from iMessage on my iPhone and WhatsApp come through with no issues. I like getting those notifications on my watch and then going to my phone to read the message. The text is previewed on the watch, but any attachments, I have to go to my phone.8. I get reminders from my calendars (Google, Apple, Work) on the watch. I like that a lot.9. The weather app is standard in look and data. Nice to have.10. You can scroll down on each app and screen, and the watch drills down to a lot detailed information. Love this. The amount of details is great (even for the weather).11. Also have alarming options. I can set alarms on my watch for daily activities.12. I love the round watch face as opposed to the square or rectangular face. It's aesthetically a beautiful watch.Cons:1. Pricier than other smartwatches, but cheaper than Apple and other high end watches. For the price, I think it has a lot. So not sure this is a con. It's more than I wanted to spend. :)2. There is so much it took a few days to set it all up the way I finally wanted it, and some were not intuitive. I even have MORE to set up, just haven't.3. I may have missed it, but they have a stopwatch. Would be nice to have a Timer.4. The watch will notify you of incoming calls and missed calls, but does not allow you to make calls, nor is there voicemail on the watch. I don't miss this actually because I usually have my phone with me too. I get the notification on the phone, and I then know to call someone back or listened to voicemail of a missed call.Overall, I am very pleased with this watch. It does what is advertised. Other than a bit lengthy and complex set up, it's primarily an activities, health tracking with some daily management watch. And I am finding that's really all I need it for. My goal of developing healthier habits is helped significantly along with this watch.",5.0,Positive,"['pro', 'sleep', 'track', 'nice', 'expect', 'provide', 'daily', 'trend', 'sleep', 'habit',

Amazfit Band 7,"I was skeptical at first - how could a $45 device be this good ?  Well, I was wrong.  The watch is great and does everything that I was looking for, and a few more benefits that I was not.  My main goal was fitness and sleep tracking but without all the complex intrusion (and cost) of an Apple Watch - if this is you then please read on.First - the watch is very easy to set up and connect with your phone. The navigation on the watch can be a little touchy, but it works well enough.I have been using for 3 weeks now and find no problems or issues that would keep me from highly recommending this brand to others !At some point, I may look for an alternative band (there are many) but for me this was a great purchase.",5.0,Positive,"['skeptical', 'first', 'could', 'device', 'good', 'well', 'wrong', 'watch', 'great', 'everything', 'look', 'benefit', 'main', 'goal', 'fitness', 'sleep', 'track', 'without', 'complex', 'intrusion', 'cost', 'apple', 'watch', 'please', 'read', 'onfirst', 'watch', 'easy', 'set', 'connect', 'phone', 'navigation', 'watch', 'little', 'touchy', 'work', 'well', 'enoughi', 'use', 'week', 'find', 'problem', 'issue', 'would', 'keep', 'highly', 'recommend', 'brand', 'others', 'point', 'may', 'look', 'alternative', 'band', 'many', 'great', 'purchase']",skeptical first could device good well wrong watch great everything look benefit main goal fitness sleep track without complex intrusion cost apple watch please read onfirst watch easy set connect phone navigation watch little touchy work well enoughi use week find problem issue would keep highly recommend brand others point may look alternative band many great purchase
Amazfit Band 7,"Decent product for the price but has some obvious flaws.The Amazfit works pretty well, but there are some issues with it:1) The wrist band is weak. It will come undone relatively easily -- which is an issue for an exercise ""work out tracking"" watch.  If you are jogging or sprinting there's a good chance it will come loose and fall off.I've remedied this by buying an alternative wrist band, but this feels like a basic design flaw that should not be there.2) The Zepp App used to control/read data from the watch is clunky and confusing.  It's not AWFUL, but could be a bit more intuitive.3) There is no alarm and the watch cannot set off an alarm on your phone.  It's wake up signal is to vibrate.

Amazfit Band 7,"Honestly would not recommend this watch at all.First, the heart rate monitor and sleep monitor are very inaccurate. I compared the heart rate measurement several times during various levels of rest or exercise with the readings from my blood pressure arm cuff. While I was expecting some inaccuracies maybe plus or minus a few bpm the watch would report 90 bpm when my blood pressure device read 130 bpm and when my blood pressure cuff read 90 this would often read anywhere from 70 to 140. Sometimes tapping the measure button would read 130 and then 2 seconds later read 80.Second, the device has a feature where if you press and hold the screen you can quickly change the watch face. This is extremely annoying as the screen is extremely sensitive and I found if my coat sleeve slid forward it would trigger it, or if I crossed my arms it would trigger it, or just resting my arms in my lap would trigger it. There is no way to disable this feature and with how sensitive the screen is to any kind of touch from anything it gets very frustrating very quickly.Finally, most of these issues could still be overlooked to an extent but after having it for only about four months the screen popped out on me and was dangling by the ribbon cable connecting it to the circuit board. I carefully set the screen back in place and glued it back in using a compound that would seal it from moisture so it wouldn't get damaged further but that didn't last long. I glued it once more with some heavy duty glue but that also failed after about a month. The third time it popped out and I glued it back in the screen had solid white vertical lines so I popped the screen out and discovered parts of the wiring on the ribbon cable had cracked due to the screen hanging freely by it. Now, with no functional screen whatsoever I am unable to turn the device off at all since there is no physical way to turn it off without using the screen. Thankfully I was at least able to turn my alarms off through the Zepp app so it would stop buzzing when sitting on my desk.Overall, this thing is cheap garbage and I wouldn't waste a penny on it. Only reason I give it 1 star is you can't give it 0 and my mom likes it cause she has metal allergies and this is the first fitness tracker she's found that does not have any metal against the skin.",1.0,Negative,"['honestly', 'would', 'recommend', 'watch', 'allfirst', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitor', 'sleep', 'monitor', 'inaccurate', 'compare', 'heart', 'rate', 'measurement', 'several', 'time', 'various', 'level', 'rest', 'exercise', 'reading', 'blood', 'pressure', 'arm', 'cuff', 'expect', 'inaccuracy', 'maybe', 'plus', 'minus', 'bpm', 'watch', 'would', 'report', 'bpm', 'blood', 'pressure', 'device', 'read', 'bpm', 'blood', 'pressure', 'cuff', 'read', 'would', 'often', 'read', 'anywhere', 'sometimes', 'tap', 'measure', 'button', 'would', 'read', 'second', 'later', 'read', 'second', 'device', 'feature', 'press', 'hold', 'screen', 'quickly', 'change', 'watch', 'face', 'extremely', 'annoy', 'screen', 'extremely', 'sensitive', 'find', 'coat', 'sleeve', 'slide', 'forward', 'would', 'trigger', 'crossed', 'arm', 'would', 'trigger', 'rest', 'arm', 'lap', 'would', 'trigger', 'way', 'disable', 'feature', 'sensitive', 'screen', 'kind', 'touch', 'anything', 'get', 'frustrate', 'quicklyfinally', 'issue', 'could', 'still', 'overlook', 'extent', 'four', 'month', 'screen', 'pop', 'dangle', 'ribbon', 'cable', 'connect', 'circuit', 'board', 'carefully', 'set', 'screen', 'back', 'place', 'glue', 'back', 'use', 'compound', 'would', 'seal', 'moisture', 'wouldnt', 'get', 'damage', 'didnt', 'last', 'long', 'glue', 'heavy', 'duty', 'glue', 'also', 'fail', 'month', 'third', 'time', 'pop', 'glue', 'back', 'screen', 'solid', 'white', 'vertical', 'line', 'pop', 'screen', 'discover', 'part', 'wire', 'ribbon', 'cable', 'crack', 'due', 'screen', 'hang', 'freely', 'functional', 'screen', 'whatsoever', 'unable', 'turn', 'device', 'since', 'physical', 'way', 'turn', 'without', 'use', 'screen', 'thankfully', 'least', 'able', 'turn', 'alarm', 'zepp', 'application', 'would', 'stop', 'buzz', 'sit', 'deskoverall', 'thing', 'cheap', 'garbage', 'wouldnt', 'waste', 'penny', 'reason', 'give', 'star', 'cant', 'give', 'mom', 'like', 'cause', 'metal', 'allergy', 'first', 'fitness', 'tracker', 'shes', 'find', 'metal', 'skin']",honestly would recommend watch allfirst heart rate monitor sleep monitor inaccurate compare heart rate measurement several time various level rest exercise reading blood pressure arm cuff expect inaccuracy maybe plus minus bpm watch would report bpm blood pressure device read bpm blood pressure cuff read would often read anywhere sometimes tap measure button would read second later read second device feature press hold screen quickly change watch face extremely annoy screen extremely sensitive find coat sleeve slide forward would trigger crossed arm would trigger rest arm lap would trigger way disable feature sensitive screen kind touch anything get frustrate quicklyfinally issue could still overlook extent four month screen pop dangle ribbon cable connect circuit board carefully set screen back place glue back use compound would seal moisture wouldnt get damage didnt last long glue heavy duty glue also fail month third time pop glue back screen solid white vertical line pop screen discover part wire ribbon cable crack due screen hang freely functional screen whatsoever unable turn device since physical way turn without use screen thankfully least able turn alarm zepp application would stop buzz sit deskoverall thing cheap garbage wouldnt waste penny reason give star cant give mom like cause metal allergy first fitness tracker shes find metal skin
Amazfit Active Smart Watch 42Mm,"I've had several Amazfit watches over the years. My current favorite is the GTR4 (round, feature-packed, nice looking watch). I had always wanted to get the GTS4 (the square version) for a second choice, but couldn't bring myself to spend the money for it (It was around $150 at the time - still a good price, but I felt guilty, since the GTR4 was already so great!). Then the Amazfit Active came along for $84, so I decided to get it. I'm so happy I did. I got the black color, but it comes in a few more. I love the watch! It's super lightweight and feels great on my wrist. I even like the fold under strap - nice and neat. This little watch is pretty much the GTS4 minus a few features. It doesn't have a barometer or altimeter (but it does have a compass), no automatic brightness, and no camera remote (I think you can actually get one if you pay for an app). There isn't storage space on the watch for music, which doesn't bother me, since I don't store music on my GTR4, anyway. Other than that, I can't think of any features it doesn't have that my other watch does; and for everyday use, I don't miss those features. There is a single flat button on the side (no rotating crown), and I think it makes this watch look more sleek and compact. There are a ton of free watch faces, and the app store with many of the same apps as I have on the GTR4. The vibration is strong enough to wake me when I'm sleeping. The speaker is not quite as loud as the GTR4, but loud enough for telephone calls. Texting has the added feature of using a tiny keyboard to type responses, which I've actually been able to do when my phone was charging, so a pretty cool feature. The GPS is accurate. I believe it can do some of the same navigation that the GTR4 does (primitive map display, bread crumbs, return route), but I don't know how big of a route you can store on it, since I haven't used that feature (I'd take the larger watch with the extra memory on a hike). The heartrate, steps, sleep tracking, blood O2, and other health features are the same as the GTR4. The display, while smaller, is still easy to read and contains all the information you need in texts, health data, etc. Battery life is very good.

Amazfit Active Smart Watch 42Mm,"The Amazfit Active is an affordable smartwatch with lots of bells and whistles. I originally purchased the GTS 4, but found the stem was bulky and placed illogically with the slightest wrist bend taking me to the menu screen or rebooting itself. The Active is pretty much identical in shape and functionality but with a flat button making it less prone to accidental pushing by wrist movement and workout gloves.I am not wild about the silicone strap. It feels cheap and I'm having a hard time finding the right hole to ensure a decent fit on my small wrist. Amazfit makes a ""vegan leather"" strap for the pink watch it sells but I haven't found any replacement bands explicitly stating they fit the Active, which makes me hesitant to look for an aftermarket band.The app is okay, but for unknown reasons, some of the settings available with the GTS 4 don't seem to be available for the Active. For example, with the GTS 4, the app/watch was happy enough with the approximate location for displaying weather info. Not so for the Active. It annoys me it won't let me enter a zip code or an approximate location. The exercise/exercise settings feature is difficult to use and set up.  I haven't been able to find a way to customize strength training so I tried using the generic indoor fitness (or one of the other ones) but that, too, insisted on counting sets. I would think you could control at least some of the settings in the app but if there's a way, I haven't found it. My last gripe with the app is it reminds me every time I open the app functionality may be limited if I don't give it full access to everything it wants to access. I know this and I don't care. I CHOOSE TO TURN OFF SOME OF THE PERMISSIONS. Yet every single time I open the app, I have to select GOT IT and then exit out of the permissions settings on my phone.If you don't need a NAMED watch, the Amazfit Active has a nice design, good performance, great battery life and decent price point.",4.0,Positive,"['amazfit', 'active', 'affordable', 'smartwatch', 'lot', 'bell', 'whistle', 'originally', 'purchase', 'gts', 'find', 'stem', 'bulky', 'place', 'illogically', 'slight', 'wrist', 'bend', 'take', 'menu', 'screen', 'reboot', 'active', 'pretty', 'much', 'identical', 'shape', 'functionality', 'flat', 'button', 'make', 'less', 'prone', 'accidental', 'push', 'wrist', 'movement', 'workout', 'glovesi', 'wild', 'silicone', 'strap', 'feel', 'cheap', 'im', 'hard', 'time', 'find', 'right', 'hole', 'ensure', 'decent', 'fit', 'small', 'wrist', 'amazfit', 'make', 'vegan', 'leather', 'strap', 'pink', 'watch', 'sell', 'havent', 'find', 'replacement', 'band', 'explicitly', 'state', 'fit', 'active', 'make', 'hesitant', 'look', 'aftermarket', 'bandthe', 'application', 'okay', 'unknown', 'reason', 'setting', 'available', 'gts', 'dont', 'seem', 'available', 'active', 'example', 'gts', 'appwatch', 'happy', 'enough', 'approximate', 'location', 'display', 'weather', 'info', 'active', 'annoys', 'wont', 'let', 'enter', 'zip', 'code', 'approximate', 'location', 'exerciseexercise', 'setting', 'feature', 'difficult', 'use', 'set', 'havent', 'able', 'find', 'way', 'customize', 'strength', 'training', 'try', 'use', 'generic', 'indoor', 'fitness', 'one', 'one', 'insist', 'count', 'set', 'would', 'think', 'could', 'control', 'least', 'setting', 'application', 'theres', 'way', 'havent', 'find', 'last', 'gripe', 'application', 'remind', 'every', 'time', 'open', 'application', 'functionality', 'may', 'limit', 'dont', 'give', 'full', 'access', 'everything', 'want', 'access', 'know', 'dont', 'care', 'choose', 'turn', 'permission', 'yet', 'every', 'single', 'time', 'open', 'application', 'select', 'get', 'exit', 'permission', 'setting', 'phoneif', 'dont', 'need', 'name', 'watch', 'amazfit', 'active', 'nice', 'design', 'good', 'performance', 'great', 'battery', 'life', 'decent', 'price', 'point']",amazfit active affordable smartwatch lot bell whistle originally purchase gts find stem bulky place illogically slight wrist bend take menu screen reboot active pretty much identical shape functionality flat button make less prone accidental push wrist movement workout glovesi wild silicone strap feel cheap im hard time find right hole ensure decent fit small wrist amazfit make vegan leather strap pink watch sell havent find replacement band explicitly state fit active make hesitant look aftermarket bandthe application okay unknown reason setting available gts dont seem available active example gts appwatch happy enough approximate location display weather info active annoys wont let enter zip code approximate location exerciseexercise setting feature difficult use set havent able find way customize strength training try use generic indoor fitness one one insist count set would think could control least setting application theres way havent find last gripe application remind every time open application functionality may limit dont give full access everything want access know dont care choose turn permission yet every single time open application select get exit permission setting phoneif dont need name watch amazfit active nice design good performance great battery life decent price point

Amazfit Balance Smart Watch 46Mm,"After my Pebble 2 SE started to wear down I switched over to the Amazfit Bip because at the time it was the only comparable smartwatch with similar battery life. Since then I upgraded to the GTS2e and now to the Balance. Needless to say I haven't found a reason to move away from Amazfit as I have always been happy with their watches.The most important feature for me is the battery life, I hate having one more thing to worry about charging if I travel or am away from a power source most of the day.  Though I have only been using the Balance for a few days, based on my experience so far I'm pretty confident you could go at least 7 days without needing a charge so long as you don't use the always on display or excessive GPS tracking.I have also enjoyed Amazfit's built in watch apps, they provide everything I need in a watch; notifications, the ability to take calls/respond to texts, a timer, alarm, and a find my mobile function that makes your phone ring when you misplace it.  The Balance also introduces an app store where additional apps can be downloaded. Its fairly limited compared to what is offered by Apple or Google, but its nice to have the option. The health tracking is just an added bonus in my book.As for the accuracy, I think it is accurate enough for what it is and can give you a good general sense of where your health metrics are at. It likely isn't as accurate as higher end fitness focused watches, but considering the cost, battery life, and user experience features it includes that are more akin to a traditional smart watch I think its a worthy compromise.The recent update to Zepp OS 3.5 has added its own built in AI assistant, Zepp Flow. It's nothing ground breaking, but it is nice to have and can make doing things like setting a timer, alarm, or starting a workout as easy as asking the watch to do it for you. It also includes Amazon Alexa which can be useful for controlling other smart home devices.Physically its very comfortable to wear, being thin and lightweight. I wear it all day and at night when sleeping without any issues whatsoever. The screen is also very vibrant and can get surprisingly bright which makes it easy to see even in direct sunlight. The included silicone watch strap is also comfortable and has a nice added feature. In the past I have had issues with silicone bands as the keeper that prevents the excess band from flopping around would wear down and allow the band to slip out, requiring me to constantly adjust it and slip it back in. The keeper on the included band has a small notch in it that allows it to plug into the last hole on the band so this should prevent it from slipping out in the future.Overall I think its a great watch for anyone that is looking for something in-between a dedicated fitness device and smart watch, it provides the best of both worlds at a reasonable price.",5.0,Positive,"['pebble', 'se', 'start', 'wear', 'switched', 'amazfit', 'bip', 'time', 'comparable', 'smartwatch', 'similar', 'battery', 'life', 'since', 'upgraded', 'gtse', 'balance', 'needless', 'say', 'havent', 'find', 'reason', 'move', 'away', 'amazfit', 'always', 'happy', 'watchesthe', 'important', 'feature', 'battery', 'life', 'hate', 'one', 'thing', 'worry', 'charge', 'travel', 'away', 'power', 'source', 'day', 'though', 'use', 'balance', 'day', 'base', 'experience', 'far', 'im', 'pretty', 'confident', 'could', 'go', 'least', 'day', 'without', 'need', 'charge', 'long', 'dont', 'use', 'always', 'display', 'excessive', 'global positioning system', 'trackingi', 'also', 'enjoy', 'amazfits', 'build', 'watch', 'application', 'provide', 'everything', 'need', 'watch', 'notification', 'ability', 'take', 'callsrespond', 'text', 'timer', 'alarm', 'find', 'mobile', 'function', 'make', 'phone', 'ring', 'misplace', 'balance', 'also', 'introduce', 'application', 'store', 'additional', 'application', 'download', 'fairly', 'limit', 'compare', 'offer', 'apple', 'google', 'nice', 'option', 'health', 'tracking', 'add', 'bonus', 'bookas', 'accuracy', 'think', 'accurate', 'enough', 'give', 'good', 'general', 'sense', 'health', 'metric', 'likely', 'isnt', 'accurate', 'high', 'end', 'fitness', 'focus', 'watch', 'consider', 'cost', 'battery', 'life', 'user', 'experience', 'feature', 'include', 'akin', 'traditional', 'smart', 'watch', 'think', 'worthy', 'compromisethe', 'recent', 'update', 'zepp', 'o', 'add', 'build', 'ai', 'assistant', 'zepp', 'flow', 'nothing', 'ground', 'break', 'nice', 'make', 'thing', 'like', 'set', 'timer', 'alarm', 'start', 'workout', 'easy', 'ask', 'watch', 'also', 'include', 'amazon', 'alexa', 'useful', 'control', 'smart', 'home', 'devicesphysically', 'comfortable', 'wear', 'thin', 'lightweight', 'wear', 'day', 'night', 'sleep', 'without', 'issue', 'whatsoever', 'screen', 'also', 'vibrant', 'get', 'surprisingly', 'bright', 'make', 'easy', 'see', 'even', 'direct', 'sunlight', 'include', 'silicone', 'watch', 'strap', 'also', 'comfortable', 'nice', 'add', 'feature', 'past', 'issue', 'silicone', 'band', 'keeper', 'prevents', 'excess', 'band', 'flop', 'around', 'would', 'wear', 'allow', 'band', 'slip', 'require', 'constantly', 'adjust', 'slip', 'back', 'keeper', 'include', 'band', 'small', 'notch', 'allow', 'plug', 'last', 'hole', 'band', 'prevent', 'slip', 'futureoverall', 'think', 'great', 'watch', 'anyone', 'look', 'something', 'inbetween', 'dedicate', 'fitness', 'device', 'smart', 'watch', 'provide', 'best', 'world', 'reasonable', 'price']",pebble se start wear switched amazfit bip time comparable smartwatch similar battery life since upgraded gtse balance needless say havent find reason move away amazfit always happy watchesthe important feature battery life hate one thing worry charge travel away power source day though use balance day base experience far im pretty confident could go least day without need charge long dont use always display excessive global positioning system trackingi also enjoy amazfits build watch application provide everything need watch notification ability take callsrespond text timer alarm find mobile function make phone ring misplace balance also introduce application store additional application download fairly limit compare offer apple google nice option health tracking add bonus bookas accuracy think accurate enough give good general sense health metric likely isnt accurate high end fitness focus watch consider cost battery life user experience feature include akin traditional smart watch think worthy compromisethe recent update zepp o add build ai assistant zepp flow nothing ground break nice make thing like set timer alarm start workout easy ask watch also include amazon alexa useful control smart home devicesphysically comfortable wear thin lightweight wear day night sleep without issue whatsoever screen also vibrant get surprisingly bright make easy see even direct sunlight include silicone watch strap also comfortable nice add feature past issue silicone band keeper prevents excess band flop around would wear allow band slip require constantly adjust slip back keeper include band small notch allow plug last hole band prevent slip futureoverall think great watch anyone look something inbetween dedicate fitness device smart watch provide best world reasonable price
Amazfit Balance Smart Watch 46Mm,"I've had some heart issues for a long time and this past year, they've gotten to the point where I need to do closer monitoring. Then, in July, I had a loop monitor implanted. While it sends a reading to my cardiologist's office every night, I needed something that would alert me when my heart rate fell above or below the doctor's parameters for my situation. I did a lot of research into a lot of watches. I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra so looked at the Galaxy watches and tried one, but the battery life is terrible. I needed a watch that had a battery that would last more than 12 hours with constant heart monitoring. I was already using an Amazfit GTS 4 Mini and loved it, the battery lasted almost 14 days, but it had no alert for heart rate and also was missing a couple other things I wanted/needed, so after looking at so-many-watches, I decided to try the Balance. So here's my review.The watch is large. At least for me, but the screen is amazing! Clear, easy to read, Amoled so the color is great. I chose to use the 'use your own photo' watch face which is new (I think) for Amazfit and I like it. There are several others to choose from and if they stay true to form, more will be added. There are a lot of apps pre-loaded on the watch and a lot to choose from to load so that would probably appeal to many who will use this for fitness. I do not so I can't speak to the fitness portion of the watch. I keep track of my steps/activity on the whole, but not any specific exercise. I got the watch on September 2nd, charged it, and with all of the heart associated apps turned on to run all the time (including running the heart rate monitor every 60 seconds,) I didn't have to charge it until the 11th, and even then, I was still at 18%, but we were going on vacation, so the battery life is great. Like I mentioned, the watch is huge, at least for me. It's 46mm, but light weight, so I don't really notice it much. It has a relatively slim profile on the wrist so I'm not banging into things with it like I thought I would. I did change the band to a stainless steel one because any silicone bands cause a rash for me. Those are the basics. Here's some of the pros and cons.PROS:Huge, clear, bright face that's easy to read, even for people who need glasses.Several watch faces to choose from including one you can personalize. Big plus!Heart/Health monitoring has been pretty accurate so far as tested at the cardiologist's officeSleep monitoring seems to be accurate, matching those times I wake during the nightWill follow DND on your phoneWill sync with Google Fit and a couple other third party health apps nowDifferent sounds per alerts so you know what alerts are coming in (can't change them though)Syncs well with Zepp app and changes on app are immediate on watchSilicone band will fit a 5-1/2"" to 10""+ wristCONS:NO ECG. None of the watches Amazfit sells in the US has ECG. That was the first question I asked them and from their response, for the foreseeable future, they will not have a watch in the US that has that.The winder is very large and really sits high on the watch. It has the potential to catch on things and does during the night so if you use DND and wear it to bed, it will catch on the sheets at some point, wake the watch, waking you.No tap-to-wake, which my GT4 Mini had and which I miss a lot. It will still 'lift to wake' if you set that, otherwise, you have to push the winder.Second button on the watch is for workout information which I don't use, but it's very flat and seems like it would be hard to use while very active.""Rotate the crown"" must mean the winder because the crown doesn't rotate and while the winder does, it only makes the face larger and not permanentlyTakes a 22mm watch band! Don't make the mistake of buying a 20mm which is a standard size.BEWARE! I went a whole day without getting any notifications. I reached out to Amazfit and they had no idea why I wasn't getting any either. Low and behold, there's an option called Cover To Mute. If that's checked and you're wearing a long sleeve shirt or sweater that covers the watch, you won't receive any notifications because the face is covered. Just letting you know!That's a flyover of the watch. On the whole, I like it. I've never been a big fan of the Zepp world. I'd be a lot happier if it was Android OS of course, but I understand their desire to work with either Android or Apple. They're getting smoother with the interaction between their OS and Android though. I'm sure I've missed a bunch, but this will give you a good idea at least.",5.0,Positive,"['ive', 'heart', 'issue', 'long', 'time', 'past', 'year', 'theyve', 'get', 'point', 'need', 'close',

Amazfit Refurbished Bip 3,I have had this fitness watch for a year and it works great - but i do question the sleep monitoring - sometimes it records that I slept 8 hrs but i only slept 6  or when i do sleep 8 hrs it says 5 or 6 - other than that i wear this all day and in the shower - no issues at all - App is easy to use and it also shows my text messages and alerts me when my ph rings - overall this is a great watch for the money - after a full charge it lasts about 10 or 12 days - highly recommend,5.0,Positive,"['fitness', 'watch', 'year', 'work', 'great', 'question', 'sleep', 'monitoring', 'sometimes', 'record', 'sleep', 'hrs', 'slept', 'sleep', 'hr', 'say', 'wear', 'day', 'shower', 'issue', 'application', 'easy', 'use', 'also', 'show', 'text', 'message', 'alert', 'ph', 'ring', 'overall', 'great', 'watch', 'money', 'full', 'charge', 'last', 'day', 'highly', 'recommend']",fitness watch year work great question sleep monitoring sometimes record sleep hrs slept sleep hr say wear day shower issue application easy use also show text message alert ph ring overall great watch money full charge last day highly recommend
Amazfit Refurbished Bip 3,"To frame this review, I'd like to point out that I purchased this entirely for sleep and exercise tracking and am using a normal digital wristwatch for normal watch functions.This thing has great battery life, looks sharp, and is a great size for readability.  The UI is fairly easy to use and the touchscreen is responsive.I haven't used all of the features but lets go over the ones that I have.SLEEP TRACKING:This is the first device I've used that does sleep tracking and it seems to do a good job of it.  The graphs are informative and it has helped me tighten up my sleep schedule automatically.  I'm not sure of the science behind how it detects different states of sleep but it seems to be at least somewhat accurate.  On days that show that I had more deep sleep, I certainly do feel more rested.MUSIC CONTROL:I use this to control my music or podcasts when working out.  It works great and includes all the buttons you would need for that.ALEXA:The Alexa feature works great using the built in microphone.  I do miss the built in speaker of the Bip 5 and the dedicated button that allow you to access this feature quickly but you can only fit so much into a small package.I use the Alexa feature regularly to set a quick countdown timer, a nap alarm, or to create reminders.  It has also been useful for settling debates quickly e.g. ""What quarterback has the most passing yards of all time"".WORKOUT TRACKING:I've only used this with stationary workouts on an exercise bike but it does a good job of tracking and graphing your workout.WEATHER:The built in weather app works well and includes sunrise/sunset data as well as a 7 day forecast.  It's good info at a glance but lacks detailed forecast information such as hourly forecasts.NOTIFICATIONS:The notifications system works well.  You opt-in to each service you'd like to receive notifications for and your band will vibrate when one comes in.  It's great at a glance.  You can deny calls from the watchface, and send preset text messages (that you can customize in the app) when rejecting the call.  I really wish they had programmed it to where you could respond to text messages with canned messages as well.  Simple ""Yes"", ""No"", ""I'm on the way"", ""Running late"" etc would be extremely helpful.APPS / WATCH FACES:I counted roughly 30 free watch faces in their app store.  The vast majority are paid options but I was able to find several free that suited me.There aren't a lot of apps to choose from and I didn't find anything in the app store that seemed useful to me in my daily life.POMODORO TIMER:This is a very simple feature but it can be life changing if you use it correctly.  Basically this is a timer where you alternate between focusing on a task and taking a break.  A popular setup is 25 minutes of focus followed by a 5 minute break.I regularly use this in my work to make sure that I stay on task, while not sitting on a single task so long that I am spinning tires.",5.0,Positive,"['frame', 'review', 'id', 'like', 'point', 'purchase', 'entirely', 'sleep', 'exercise', 'track', 'use', 'normal', 'digital', 'wristwatch', 'normal', 'watch', 'functionsthis', 'thing', 'great', 'battery', 'life', 'look', 'sharp', 'great', 'size', 'readability', 'ui', 'fairly', 'easy', 'use', 'touchscreen', 'responsivei', 'havent', 'use', 'feature', 'let', 'go', 'one', 'havesleep', 'trackingthis', 'first', 'device', 'ive', 'use', 'sleep', 'tracking', 'seem', 'good', 'job', 'graph', 'informative', 'help', 'tighten', 'sleep', 'schedule', 'automatically', 'im', 'sure', 'science', 'behind', 'detects', 'different', 'state', 'sleep', 'seem', 'least', 'somewhat', 'accurate', 'day', 'show', 'deep', 'sleep', 'certainly', 'feel', 'restedmusic', 'controli', 'use', 'control', 'music', 'podcast', 'work', 'work', 'great', 'include', 'button', 'would', 'need', 'thatalexathe', 'alexa', 'feature', 'work', 'great', 'use', 'build', 'microphone', 'miss', 'build', 'speaker', 'bip', 'dedicate', 'button', 'allow', 'access', 'feature', 'quickly', 'fit', 'much', 'small', 'packagei', 'use', 'alexa', 'feature', 'regularly', 'set', 'quick', 'countdown', 'timer', 'nap', 'alarm', 'create', 'reminder', 'also', 'useful', 'settle', 'debate', 'quickly', 'example', 'quarterback', 'passing', 'yard', 'timeworkout', 'trackingive', 'use', 'stationary', 'workout', 'exercise', 'bike', 'good', 'job', 'track', 'graph', 'workoutweatherthe', 'build', 'weather', 'application', 'work', 'well', 'include', 'sunrisesunset', 'data', 'well', 'day', 'forecast', 'good', 'info', 'glance', 'lack', 'detail', 'forecast', 'information', 'hourly', 'forecastsnotificationsthe', 'notification', 'system', 'work', 'well', 'optin', 'service', 'youd', 'like', 'receive', 'notification', 'band', 'vibrate', 'one', 'come', 'great', 'glance', 'deny', 'call', 'watchface', 'send', 'preset', 'text', 'message', 'customize', 'application', 'reject', 'call', 'really', 'wish', 'programmed', 'could', 'respond', 'text', 'message', 'can', 'message', 'well', 'simple', 'yes', 'im', 'way', 'run', 'late', 'and so on', 'would', 'extremely', 'helpfulapps', 'watch', 'facesi', 'count', 'roughly', 'free', 'watch', 'face', 'application', 'store', 'vast', 'majority', 'pay', 'option', 'able', 'find', 'several', 'free', 'suit', 'methere', 'arent', 'lot', 'application', 'choose', 'didnt', 'find', 'anything', 'application', 'store', 'seem', 'useful', 'daily', 'lifepomodoro', 'timerthis', 'simple', 'feature', 'life', 'change', 'use', 'correctly', 'basically', 'timer', 'alternate', 'focus', 'task', 'take', 'break', 'popular', 'setup', 'minute', 'focus', 'follow', 'minute', 'breaki', 'regularly', 'use', 'work', 'make', 'sure', 'stay', 'task', 'sit', 'single', 'task', 'long', 'spin', 'tire']",frame review id like point purchase entirely sleep exercise track use normal digital wristwatch normal watch functionsthis thing great battery life look sharp great size readability ui fairly easy use touchscreen responsivei havent use feature let go one havesleep trackingthis first device ive use sleep tracking seem good job graph informative help tighten sleep schedule automatically im sure science behind detects different state sleep seem least somewhat accurate day show deep sleep certainly feel restedmusic controli use control music podcast work work great include button would need thatalexathe alexa feature work great use build microphone miss build speaker bip dedicate button allow access feature quickly fit much small packagei use alexa feature regularly set quick countdown timer nap alarm create reminder also useful settle debate quickly example quarterback passing yard timeworkout trackingive use stationary workout exercise bike good job track graph workoutweatherthe build weather application work well include sunrisesunset data well day forecast good info glance lack detail forecast information hourly forecastsnotificationsthe notification system work well optin service youd like receive notification band vibrate one come great glance deny call watchface send preset text message customize application reject call really wish programmed could respond text message can message well simple yes im way run late and so on would extremely helpfulapps watch facesi count roughly free watch face application store vast majority pay option able find several free suit methere arent lot application choose didnt find anything application store seem useful daily lifepomodoro timerthis simple feature life change use correctly basically timer alternate focus task take break popular setup minute focus follow minute breaki regularly use work make sure stay task sit single task long spin tire

Amazfit Refurbished Bip 3,"I decided I wanted to step away from my phone more but still wanted to know if any texts or calls came in while my phone was not next to me and so I started looking for a smart watch. Goodness. There’s a lot of cheap options but let me tell you - they don’t work! I bought three others before me this one, wasted so much time trying to figure them out and still they never actually worked. But this watch- ACTUALLY WORKS. For that, I’m happy. I wanted something smaller but since this is the only one that functions, I’ll deal with it. Now I get to put the phone away and see how it goes. This is day 1 so we will see but if that’s your reasoning to get a watch, choose this one and save yourself many headaches. Only negative thing I see is that there are very few free watch faces.

Amazfit Refurbished Bip 3,"UPDATE: I had such high hopes for this product (see original post below) but now that I have been using it for less than a month:1) I can no longer trigger it to come on through wrist activation-even after resetting etc2) The distance calculator for running is off by about .2 miles3) the brightness of the watch face (regardless of the background) has decreased overtime and nothing seems to be able to fix it4)  The watch is hit or miss in terms of activating it with touch so now not only does it not wrist activated, you never know if you will be able to activate it or not with touchOriginal POST: I have used several fitness trackers (Fitbit, Garmin) and recently got fed up with my Fitbit because I could never read the watch face if I was outside.  I wanted to try something new, but didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I like to use my fitness tracker for overall steps, calories and to see overall mileage during a run as well as overall calories burned during other workouts.  I decided to get a refurbed Amazfit as the price was incredible.  Here is what I LOVE about the watch and a few comments about what I will need to get used to:LOVE-there are so many watch faces to chose from, and everyone I have tried makes it so easy to see the information no matter where I am-love the look of this watch, it's a bigger face than my old Fitbit and I think the design is excellent-battery life is great-it was so easy to set up and the app is easy to navigate-love all the different workout options that are included, I swim a lot in the summer and it was fun to track it-just love it overallGETTING USED TO-it presents calories as Kcals and there is no way to change this, so I am learning how to convert to regular calories burned, a little annoying but considering how much I love the watch overall, not a big dealAfter two days with my Amazfit, I can't imagine ever using a Fitbit again.

Amazfit Active 2,"I was so hesitant to buy this because the reviews on smartwatches are always all over the place and I don’t want to regret my purchase. I don’t regret my purchase at all!! I previously had multiple different Fitbits and this watch blows them all out of the water! My latest Fitbit kept automatically disconnecting from my Bluetooth so I wouldn’t get my phone notifications - a feature that I had come to rely on. Fitbit customer service said it was because I wasn’t manually syncing my device in the app enough (1-2 times per day wasn’t sufficient, according to them, which is just absurd). I never had to do that with previous models and decided I was fed up. Not only can I confirm that this device stays connected to Bluetooth, but it does so without me even opening the app to sync the device, just like my older model Fitbits did. Sweet relief! It also gives the option to receive notifications from many different apps on your phone (social media, security camera apps, etc). And that’s not all! The battery life on this thing is amazing! I charge it every time I take a shower so it never goes below 90%. I tested it the first few days by not charging it and, by my calculations, it would have lasted around 8 days before needing to be charged with every single health screening feature turned ON! That’s incredible!! The display is gorgeous and the auto-workout tracker is extremely accurate. The only thing I will say is that I do think my Fitbit tracked my sleep better. There was one night that I was very restless and woke up three times to use the bathroom. Despite this, my Amazfit said I only woke up once. I literally walked steps to the bathroom, but apparently that wasn’t enough to trigger an “awake” reading. I still think it’s pretty dang accurate, though, and I choose this watch 100 times over. I can’t say enough good about it! I loved the default watch face that it comes with, but I prefer digital clocks so I chose a different one (as you can see in the photo). I do wish there were more choices, or that you could customize what is displayed on a specific watch face, but there are still quite a lot to choose from and it’s a huge visual upgrade compared to my previous Fitbits. I also like the “stress” tracker, though I’m not exactly sure how accurate this feature is. Still, it’s nice to be mindful of that and try to do some self care to bring those numbers down. Don’t be swayed by negative reviews. My husband has a different model (more “rugged” and “manly” looking lol) and he loves his just as much as I do.

Amazfit Active 2,"The device itself was wonderful and seemed to track fairly. I didn’t have any issues with the battery, and it was easy to charge and use. The pricing value was also very good in my experience. I appreciated the endless list of features. The watch was also lightweight, which was appreciated. I also loved the look of it, which was very stylish and didn’t scream “hi, I’m a nerd wearing a techy watch!”The downside for me was the connectivity issues that prevented me from using these wonderful features beyond the watch screen. Having bought it exclusively for fitness tracking, being unable to reliably store the data without manually disconnecting the watch and reconnecting each time was very frustrating.

Amazfit Active 2,"After about a month it stopped measuring heart rate. I'd power cycle it and at first that worked. The it required a complete reset, but it still keeps failing to measure heart rate. Now no matter what I do it won't measure it. Watch is mostly useless now.Update:I contacted amazfit and without any hassle they sent me a new replacement watch despite me buying a refurb not through them.

Amazfit Bip 5,"Originally wanted an Apple Watch. Decided to buy this to see if I even wanted anything at all. I was pleasantly surprised! Well made. Comfortable. Long-lasting battery. Can receive texts and calls coming through (just can’t talk or text through the watch, but that’s ok for me).The Zepp app works well too. I think the only improvement I’d like to see for that is the food log. I’m used to the Calorie Count app where you scan the barcode. The food log has an AI powered assistant.The Zepp app logs food through photo, text or voice. It occasionally gets it wrong, but there’s the ability to edit an incorrect item.Overall, I really like it!

I though maybe it was a fluke, so the next day I ran another mile and it calculated 0.75 miles. While the treadmill and watch do not usually match up, my fitbit was never this far off from the treadmill.

Amazfit Bip 5,"After 4 months of using the Amazfit Bip 5 Unity fitness watch I found it to be very disappointing.  On the plus side it has a nice display, relatively good battery life, but when it comes to 'smart' and health and fitness monitoring, this watch falls short.  I don't like the user interface which requires swiping up or down or right and left to select various functions. Where to find settings is not intuitive and the software just doesn't work well at all.  Here are some reasons I dislike this product:- By default, it issues too many notifications and doesn't make it easy to change settings- Settings are in too many different places- One feature I really wanted to work is ""To Do"" list which allows the user to set reminders, but if you try to edit an item, it fails to find it, while it continues to send you notifications !??  I set reminders to do a certain activity during the day and this triggers an alert to remind me, but when the clock switched to Daily Savings Time, the reminders were delayed by one hour !?!- Some features worked for a while, but then stopped working, ie ability to receive txt messages, control your phone music player, receive app notifications - just stopped working - Did they update the software and broke it?- Support respond quickly to inquiries about problems, but the answers they provide tell me they are NOT familiar with this product.-  The step counter won't register activity until you've been stepping for quite a while which makes me wonder if it is accurate.-  Heartbeat measurements are NOT accurate-  Blood Oxygen measurements are NOT accurate-  Sleep monitoring is terrible - I wouldn't trust it.-  I tried to use Outdoor cycling tracking, but it fails to detect your mobile phone's GPSThis product tries to do a lot of things, but does most of them poorly.

Amazfit Gtr 3,"April 6, 2024: Update, I reached out to customer service because, well, the battery problem is simply unacceptable for only having it for just over a year. Let me preface how it is used: I wear it 24/7, but use it to 1) look at texts/calls as they come in 2) check the time, 3) use the stop watch for about 20 minutes a day total and 4) find my phone. Most of these features I only use about 5 times a week. I don't use it to play games or really much of anything that would suck the battery up too badly. So when I reached out to customer service their response was very obviously automated asking me to troubleshoot the problem. No issue. When I did and said more or less, ""it is pretty obviously the battery"", they essentially reiterated ways I could try to ""save"" the battery life, with another automated response. Suggestions included:Please refer to the following instructions to troubleshoot the issue:1) The watch charging takes about 2.5 hours, please confirm whether your watch is fully charged;2) The battery life may vary according to settings, usage, climatic temperature, and other factors. So the actual result may differ from the laboratory data.3) The more power-consuming applications in the watch will also shorten the battery life.  Please also check whether the watch is with the latest firmware.  If not, please upgrade the watch and observe the battery performance;Note: The following apps would cause fast power consumption: screen display, sleep breathing quality, frequent use of Bluetooth phones or listening to music (if supported), the Screen-on Duration for too long, too many notification reminders, Always On Display enabled, GPS for a long time Exercise, turn on Auto Blood Oxygen Monitor, etc.4) Then please do the following settings to see if the watch battery life will improve.* Set the Response speed of Lift wrist to view info function to Normal mode* Turn off the Always On Display* Disable Sleep breathing quality monitoring* Disable Auto Stress Monitoring* Disable Auto Blood Oxygen Monitor* Change the Screen-on Duration time to 5 seconds* Do not choose any Wake-up Mode for Offline Voice ControlIt has now been 4 days since that reply, at which point I reiterated that it is very obviously an issue with the battery and disabling any and all of the above ""suggestions"" would defeat the purpose of having a smartwatch. I'm still waiting on a response. Changing my review to a one star because of the customer service.March 31, 2024: I've had this watch for over a year, 16 months to be exact. All of a sudden the battery life just tanked, despite using it exactly the same as I always have in the past. It's battery life is okay but only lasts about half as long as it used to.Additionally, it has issues with notifications where it will continue to display text notifications that I've already read and acknowledged.  Again, not a big deal but annoying.Overall, it is an okay watch.

Amazfit Balance 2,"Smart watches have either come a really long way in the past two years since my last Google watch, or this is just a superior product. My guess is the latter. Beautiful big screen, add an animated face if you like, and still get four or five days usage between charges. Then, the charge is quick and easy. Accurate sleep, blood oxygen, and heart rate readings, plus bunches of personalized prompts if you buy the subscription service. I didn't know about that one upfront, but it was $30 for the first year and the prompts seem useful, not fluffy, so didn't feel too bad about that surprise.

Amazfit Balance 2,"Garmin Fenix features and quality for a third of the price. In some areas it's actually got features Garmin doesn't currently match.  The AI assistant is actually shockingly useful for something they aren't charging for. Amazing batter life, fantastic tracking. I've been wearing mine for cross training (weights, plus, running) and  it hasn't missed a beat. Easily connects to external sensors if you want to wear a strap but so far the wrist monitor has been great. Id probably still strap for dedicated HIIT workouts but the watch has surprised me even when doing wrist intensive activity.The only thing that it absolutely sucks at is food tracking and that has nothing to do with the watch itself.  They want it or be exclusively AI based and yes when it works it's quick and super convenient but when it misses you have zero. ZERO ability to edit or enter manual foods.  It's a new feature for zepp so hopefully they build this out to Include more traditional food database entry. For now it's just not useable for anyone serious about nutrition.

Amazfit Balance 2,"I’ve never looked forward to a watch more—and been so disappointed—than with the Balance 2. I had high hopes and eagerly awaited its arrival, but the reality didn’t live up to the anticipation.First, while it may seem minor to some, the bright blue bezel was a dealbreaker for me. I was genuinely surprised that Amazfit launched this device with only a bold blue option. It’s a puzzling choice, especially when most people would likely prefer a more neutral color scheme. In person, the blue is brighter than it appears in photos and clashed heavily with the included red band. The combination just felt off, and I couldn't understand why multiple color options weren't offered from the start.Second—and more frustrating—is the display's inability to repel fingerprints. It’s one of the worst I’ve experienced. Despite the Sapphire glass, fingerprints stick easily and require constant wiping. I’ve used many watches, including the Apple Watch Ultra, and never had an issue this bad. It became a daily annoyance.Third, the performance was underwhelming. On certain watch faces, the second hand would freeze, and navigating the app list would lag or become unresponsive. Oddly, the Balance 2 felt slower and less stable than the original Balance 1.While I appreciate the effort Amazfit made with the Balance 2, the execution fell short. Perhaps the $299 price point doesn’t allow for higher-end materials or better performance, but ironically, the Gorilla Glass on my T-Rex 3 handled fingerprints far better. So did the Balance 1.In the end, I returned the Balance 2 and will likely return to Garmin.

Amazfit Renewed Bip 5,"I love the battery life this watch has. I bought this to replace my fitbit versa 2. I have always been able to reach my step and stair goal most days with the total 3 fitbit watches I've had over the years. I've had this watch for a few months and loved it but noticed right off the bat ,I was unable to reach my step goal and have not reached it one time since putting it on. I was chaulking it up to my old watch being worn out and I just wasn't moving as much. Even during the holidays where I am running most of the day, I couldn't reach 9k steps compared to almost 20k for previous watches.

Amazfit Bip 3,"This is probably my 5th smart watch, but my first after leaving the Pebble ecosystem. I was very attached to the Pebble approach to smart watches, and it's been impossible to find an exact replacement. For the price, this is probably as good as it gets.I've had this for over a year, and if it broke tomorrow, I would replace it.Pros:- Excellent battery life, as good as advertised. I haven't keep precise tabs on how long, but easily a couple of weeks. I wear this day and night, and recharge it periodically ""when I remember"" while in the shower. Battery life is a top priority for me - I am absolutely not going to have a watch I have to charge daily.- Light weight and a good size - not too big or too small. Comfortable to wear all the time and forget about.- Has the features I care most about - sleep tracking, exercise tracking, message/email notifications, and alarm/stopwatch.- Design is inoffensive (most casual people think this is an Apple product for some reason)- WaterproofCons:- Really miss the always-on display from the Pebbles- The plastic display gets light scratches easily (but not so badly it interferes with operation)- Unlike other people, I find the Zepp app irritating. It buries what I want under too many menu layers, and is set up to constantly push you to purchase add-ons.- I'm not in love with the watch face selection- The included silicon watch strap didn't last long, maybe a few months at most.Neither a pro/con - the all-plastic design is not my preference, but for the price exactly what I expected.Overall, this is really decent product for the price. Honestly I was surprised at how reliable and sturdy it's been - every smart watch I've had has had some kind of hardware issue or problem by the 1 year mark. But this little device keeps trooping and has the minimum set of feature I require. Every compromise (materials, screen type) that's a demerit for me is an understandable function of price.I would absolutely recommend this if your criteria are the same as mine.",5.0,Positive,"['probably', 'th', 'smart', 'watch', 'first', 'leave', 'pebble', 'ecosystem', 'attach', 'pebble', 'approach', 'smart', 'watch', 'impossible', 'find', 'exact', 'replacement', 'price', 'probably', 'good', 'getsive', 'year', 'break', 'tomorrow', 'would', 'replace', 'itpros', 'excellent', 'battery', 'life', 'good', 'advertised', 'havent', 'keep', 'precise', 'tab', 'long', 'easily', 'couple', 'week', 'wear', 'day', 'night', 'recharge', 'periodically', 'remember', 'shower', 'battery', 'life', 'top', 'priority', 'absolutely', 'go', 'watch', 'charge', 'daily', 'light', 'weight', 'good', 'size', 'big', 'small', 'comfortable', 'wear', 'time', 'forget', 'feature', 'care', 'sleep', 'tracking', 'exercise', 'track', 'messageemail', 'notification', 'alarmstopwatch', 'design', 'inoffensive', 'casual', 'people', 'think', 'apple', 'product', 'reason', 'waterproofcons', 'really', 'miss', 'alwayson', 'display', 'pebbles', 'plastic', 'display', 'get', 'light', 'scratch', 'easily', 'badly', 'interfere', 'operation', 'unlike', 'people', 'find', 'zepp', 'application', 'irritate', 'buries', 'want', 'many', 'menu', 'layer', 'set', 'constantly', 'push', 'purchase', 'addons', 'im', 'love', 'watch', 'face', 'selection', 'include', 'silicon', 'watch', 'strap', 'didnt', 'last', 'long', 'maybe', 'month', 'mostneither', 'procon', 'allplastic', 'design', 'preference', 'price', 'exactly', 'expectedoverall', 'really', 'decent', 'product', 'price', 'honestly', 'surprise', 'reliable', 'sturdy', 'every', 'smart', 'watch', 'ive', 'kind', 'hardware', 'issue', 'problem', 'year', 'mark', 'little', 'device', 'keep', 'troop', 'minimum', 'set', 'feature', 'require', 'every', 'compromise', 'material', 'screen', 'type', 'thats', 'demerit', 'understandable', 'function', 'pricei', 'would', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'criterion', 'mine']",probably th smart watch first leave pebble ecosystem attach pebble approach smart watch impossible find exact replacement price probably good getsive year break tomorrow would replace itpros excellent battery life good advertised havent keep precise tab long easily couple week wear day night recharge periodically remember shower battery life top priority absolutely go watch charge daily light weight good size big small comfortable wear time forget feature care sleep tracking exercise track messageemail notification alarmstopwatch design inoffensive casual people think apple product reason waterproofcons really miss alwayson display pebbles plastic display get light scratch easily badly interfere operation unlike people find zepp application irritate buries want many menu layer set constantly push purchase addons im love watch face selection include silicon watch strap didnt last long maybe month mostneither procon allplastic design preference price exactly expectedoverall really decent product price honestly surprise reliable sturdy every smart watch ive kind hardware issue problem year mark little device keep troop minimum set feature require every compromise material screen type thats demerit understandable function pricei would absolutely recommend criterion mine
Amazfit Bip 3,"Pleased with it. It's pretty good for what I needed it for. The display is nice – big enough to see my stats without feeling like I'm squinting. Setup was a breeze; it played nice with my several years old iphone.Now, let's talk battery life – the one thing that left me feeling a bit meh. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. I have to charge it more often than I'd like. Every 3 days or so. An extra day would've been awesome, but for the price I paid it's ok... I guess you win some, you lose some.The health and fitness tracking is solid. Steps, heart rate, sleep – it's all there. The design is cool, not too flashy. Straps are comfy, and the size is good - it doesn't look like I stole the watch from some sci-fi movie. Notifications come through fine, too, so I'm not missing out on the important stuff.In a nutshell, it is an average choice in the smartwatch world if you don't want to invest too much. If you're cool with charging every few days and just need the basic stuff without breaking the bank, it'll do the job.

Amazfit Bip 3,"Positives:- Long battery life, lasts about two weeks (although I tend to charge before it goes all the way down to zero, maybe on the 10th day or so)- Quick charging- Great functionality - lots of exercise options for instance (yoga, elliptical, walking, indoor fitness, dance are the exercises I do the most, and these are all available), sleep tracking, HR monitoring, alarms / stopwatch / timer etc- Different watch faces- Easy navigation in both the app and on the watch face. On the watch, a double-click gets you to the various functions and you can easily get to the workout option you need, or a down swipe gets you to the alarm setting. App is similarly intuitive and easy to use.Negatives:- Feel of the watch. It looks great and could even pass for an Apple Watch, but it’s much lighter, the straps and buckle don’t feel quite as solid, the watch itself is housed in an all-plastic casing. For the price, this is perhaps expected, and hopefully it will last longer than the more expensive Apple Watch and Fitbit it’s replacing- While the app is good, it has some grammatical issues (amazfit needs better proofers or translators!)- My biggest beef is actually with the PAI. Unlike Fitbit’s “active zone minutes” which has a clear calculation methodology (1 active zone minute for every minute HR is in fat burn zone, double that in the cardio/peak zone), PAI calcs are much less transparent. Also PAI is based on a rolling 7-day count of your full day’s activity, and doesn’t reset week to week like Active Zone minutes. All this to say that you have to be fairly consistent in achieving a higher level of activity every single day to maintain the target PAI of 100, unlike the Fitbit where you can feel good about earning your Active Zone Minutes for the calendar week in shorter periods of more intense activity. I suppose this should be a motivator, but it also feels like I’m getting dinged if I take one rest day in a week because it affects my present PAI. Also, you can earn PAI more easily from getting your heart rate up to the anaerobic zone, even if it’s a shorter workout and you burn fewer calories than in a longer, more sustained workout at a lower heart rate zone. Eg. Getting your heart rate up to 95% of your max for 20 mins and burning 170 calories is worth more in PAI, than a 1-hr workout at 70% of your max heart rate and burning 350 calories. If you don’t care about tracking the PAI metric, then this shouldn’t bother you.Overall a good product!-------Update: Comparison with FITBIT Versa 2- HR monitor. The Amazfit overestimates heart rate during exercise. Eg. during Zumba workouts my peak HR gets up to 190 bpm on the Amazfit vs 157 on Fitbit (which seems more feasible - not out of breath!)- Calories burned. Similarly, the Amazfit overestimates calories burned during exercise - for a 50 min dance workout, the Amazfit registers 340 calories burned, vs Fitbit's 228.- Activity auto-tracking. The Fitbit can sense activity even without turning the ""exercise"" function on but the Amazfit is not sensitive to this.- Steps. Fitbit's more generous in counting steps than Amazfit; my 50-min dance workout gave me almost 4000 steps on the Fitbit, vs 3,450 on the Amazfit.-  PAI vs Active Minutes. Amazfit's PAI metric mostly rewards cardio workouts, whereas Fitbit rewards you for time spent on exercising even if it's lower intensity.",4.0,Positive,"['positive', 'long', 'battery', 'life',

Amazfit Gts 2,"I’ve had this watch for 2.5yrs now and it’s still going strong!! Best I’ve used and better than other fancy watches that are 10X+ more expensive! Battery lasts days and recharges fast! You can get alerts for calls and messages (I have it linked to direct calls and texts and WhatsApp), answer or reject calls using the phone, gives current weather when linked to your phone, tracks your cycles etc. Great and accurate at tracking heart rate, blood pressure, sleeping patterns and have good workout tracking options. And my favorite feature that really makes this watch shine is that it’s waterproof! I wear it 24/7, in the shower/bath etc and wait for it for swimming on a regular basis. It tracks laps I swim and after 2.5 years it’s not showing any issues with water getting in! How amazing is that! Not even Apple Watches do that, in fact my iPhone 12 died after a few months of purchase after wearing it around a water park with less than 5 mins of min shallow water submersion!

Amazfit Gts 2,"I use the Notify for Amazfit app to add way better sleep tracking which includes heart rate measurements too.This is used with Sleep As Android app.In addition to excellent battery life, I also get my text and email notifications so I can stay on top of things. It takes a while to get everything set up but once done it was well worth the investment.Costs an extra $2.99 for the Notify for Amazfit app's pro version (that's all that's needed) for text/call messages displayed on a high resolution screen.No more pulling out my phone to find out it's one of those robo calls... A simple twist of my wrist is all it takes.Did I say battery life? I now get about 1 and 1/2 to 2 weeks which is way more than I would have ever expected considering I use this all the time and the display is always on and the heart rate is being taken every 5 minutes.I initially got this according to the sleep reviews I was reading but now find it to be an indispensable tool without always having to reach for my phone.Which now stays in my pocket mostly.The addition of a pretty accurate weather forecast keeps me from going out without a coat if needed here in Las Vegas which can be unpredictable at times during the winter season.The inclusion of a Pomodoro Timer was very unexpected and being put to use.I use other apps and devices to get my workout data and have not tried to see how it performs against this device but they all integrate well with Google Fit.I can't comment much about the steps feature as I only care about how much time I'm doing an activity and the heart rate monitor seems to be good enough to show that I'm working at it thoughout the day automatically and the built in PAI display tells me as well.No inexpensive wrist-based watch can give any pulse accuracy you can Bank on.

Amazfit Gts 2,"05/22/22 - I have had this watch for a little over a week (using with a Pixel 6 Pro). My summary take is: lots of good with a few rough spots.Pros:* Price: For the cost and what it does, this thing is a great value.* Battery life: As I am writing this, it has been seven days since I took it off the charger and I am sitting at 37% batter. Pretty outstanding.* Comfort: This thing is comfortable. Numerous times I have caught myself looking down at my wrist the make sure I am still wearing it. I literally can't tell that I am still wearing it at times. It is so lightweight. Also, I don't feel compelled to remove it when I get sweaty, as I have for other smart watches I own. Even when it gets sweaty, it is easy to wipe clean.* Sleep tracking: I am certainly not a sleep tracking nut, so I can not speak to the nitty gritty of things like REM tracking and such. But I will say that this has accurately tracked my general sleep duration every night this past week. And it is automatic! I previously used an app on my phone to track my sleep duration, but I would have to manually start it and stop it each night/morning. But with this watch, I just go to sleep and it automatically tracks it.* Music control: This is an important feature to me because I like to be able to play/pause my phone's music without needing to pull my phone out of my pocket. The music controls are not quite as convenient as what you'll find on Wear OS, but it certainly gets the job done.Cons:* Google Fit integration: This is hit and miss. It does seem to accurately track my daily steps to Google Fit. Exercise activity is a different story. The only two exercise types I have explicitly done on the Amazfit are indoor biking and outdoor biking. In both cases, the Zepp app syncs those to Google Fit as ""Others"", not as their actual exercise types.

Amazfit Bip 3,"Received lilac colored watch 100% charged on December 3, 2024:*Purchased a snowman clock face for winter and added no other apps or faces.*The screen area is large and clear enough that I can read it easily, from a reasonable distance without my glasses-at the same distance, I can not read my PC monitor, without glasses.*You will need your personal cell phone to activate your watch. You will use the app on your phone to interact with your watch more extensively--like to add apps, or to purchase watch faces.  Speaking of watch faces, there is a decent collection, and they are very reasonably priced!  I plan to get more pretty soon, but not before I finish this review. Overall, it is fairly simple and straight forward to activate the watch and to get apps and watch faces for it.*You need to activate some features before they will work.  I did NOT activate any features.  I am using ONLY the out-of-the-box features. EXCEPT that I did purchase and install a snowman watch face.*The way it should operate is that when you lift your arm to look at it, it lights up; otherwise, it remains dark(off).  But this is not actually what happens.  The watch needs to determine when you are moving to look at the face, so that it knows when to turn the screen on.  Well, the sensor in my watch is very, very sensitive.  Sometimes I can just move my arm a little bit and the screen will come on.  Although, most times the screen does react properly.  Also, sometimes I get annoyed because it will go off to quickly. I try to listen to my 8 yo grandkid talk to me, and when I look back at my watch two sentences later, the screen is off.  I am sure there is a setting for that, but right now, I am not changing anything from factory settings outside of what I had to do to activate the watch.*I have some issue with the button on the side of the watch, but I am just not actually sure what it is.  I THINK that when I lift my arm up while I am pushing the button to view the time, that it causes the watch to scroll to give more information about the statistics posted on the face.  Not positive that is what happens though, because it does not happen that often.  Also, the button digs into the back of my hand when I am active and it bends backwards.  Sometimes that activates it and causes the problem above, but I do not catch it until it's too late to KNOW what happened.12/19/2024 Update:*It has been 15 days since I activated and started using my watch.  I still have about one-third of the battery life left!  That just blows my mind.  Everything is the same as it was above, I am pretty positive that I was correct about the issue with the button.December 28, 2024  battery is finally ready to be recharged.  I am fairly positive I would have had another day or two, but I do not want to push it.  So, the initial charged battery (out of the box) lasted 25 days.I will come back and update if something comes up with the watch, or if I experiment some more.  I am not worried, even if it does go nuts or something, I bought the protection plan.",5.0,Positive,"['receive', 'lilac', 'color', 'watch', 'charge', 'december', 'purchase', 'snowman', 'clock', 'face', 'winter', 'add', 'application', 'facesthe', 'screen', 'area', 'large', 'clear', 'enough', 'read', 'easily', 'reasonable', 'distance', 'without', 'glassesat', 'distance', 'read', 'pc', 'monitor', 'without', 'glassesyou', 'need', 'personal', 'cell', 'phone', 'activate', 'watch', 'use', 'application', 'phone', 'interact', 'watch', 'extensivelylike', 'add', 'application', 'purchase', 'watch', 'face', 'speak', 'watch', 'face', 'decent', 'collection', 'reasonably', 'price', 'plan', 'get', 'pretty', 'soon', 'finish', 'review', 'overall', 'fairly', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', 'activate', 'watch', 'get', 'application', 'watch', 'face', 'ityou', 'need', 'activate', 'feature', 'work', 'activate', 'feature', 'use', 'outofthebox', 'feature', 'except', 'purchase', 'install', 'snowman', 'watch', 'facethe', 'way', 'operate', 'lift', 'arm', 'look', 'light', 'otherwise', 'remain', 'darkoff', 'actually', 'happen', 'watch', 'need', 'determine', 'move', 'look', 'face', 'know', 'turn', 'screen', 'well', 'sensor', 'watch', 'sensitive', 'sometimes', 'move', 'arm', 'little', 'bit', 'screen', 'come', 'although', 'time', 'screen', 'react', 'properly', 'also', 'sometimes', 'get', 'annoyed', 'go', 'quickly', 'try', 'listen', 'yo', 'grandkid', 'talk', 'look', 'back', 'watch', 'two', 'sentence', 'later', 'screen', 'sure', 'set', 'right', 'change', 'anything', 'factory', 'setting', 'outside', 'activate', 'watchi', 'issue', 'button', 'side', 'watch', 'actually', 'sure', 'think', 'lift', 'arm', 'push', 'button', 'view', 'time', 'cause', 'watch', 'scroll', 'give', 'information', 'statistic', 'post', 'face', 'positive', 'happen', 'though', 'happen', 'often', 'also', 'button', 'dig', 'back', 'hand', 'active', 'bend', 'backwards', 'sometimes', 'activate', 'cause', 'problem', 'catch', 'late', 'know', 'happen', 'updateit', 'day', 'since', 'activate', 'start', 'use', 'watch', 'still', 'onethird', 'battery', 'life', 'leave', 'blow', 'mind', 'everything', 'pretty', 'positive', 'correct', 'issue', 'buttondecember', 'battery', 'finally', 'ready', 'recharge', 'fairly', 'positive', 'would', 'another', 'day', 'two', 'want', 'push', 'initial', 'charge', 'battery', 'box', 'last', 'daysi', 'come', 'back', 'update', 'something', 'come', 'watch', 'experiment', 'worry', 'even', 'go', 'nuts', 'something', 'buy', 'protection', 'plan']",receive lilac color watch charge december purchase snowman clock face winter add application facesthe screen area large clear enough read easily reasonable distance without glassesat distance read pc monitor without glassesyou need personal cell phone activate watch use application phone interact watch extensivelylike add application purchase watch face speak watch face decent collection reasonably price plan get pretty soon finish review overall fairly simple straight forward activate watch get application watch face ityou need activate feature work activate feature use outofthebox feature except purchase install snowman watch facethe way operate lift arm look light otherwise remain darkoff actually happen watch need determine move look face know turn screen well sensor watch sensitive sometimes move arm little bit screen come although time screen react properly also sometimes get annoyed go quickly try listen yo grandkid talk look back watch two sentence later screen sure set right change anything factory setting outside activate watchi issue button side watch actually sure think lift arm push button view time cause watch scroll give information statistic post face positive happen though happen often also button dig back hand active bend backwards sometimes activate cause problem catch late know happen updateit day since activate start use watch still onethird battery life leave blow mind everything pretty positive correct issue buttondecember battery finally ready recharge fairly positive would another day two want push initial charge battery box last daysi come back update something come watch experiment worry even go nuts something buy protection plan

Amazfit Bip 3,"UPDATE (ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW)I've gotten notifications to work consistently now, but I wish the user experience in setting up the watch and getting them working had been clearer. I had to go into the notifications settings where you turn on notifications from different apps, and I had to go to the bottom and activate the one that just said ""APP,"" which to me seems kind of weird and not very intuitive--but at least it's working now.Other than that, I really like it a lot.____________________________________________________________________I've followed the troubleshooting steps in the Zepp app and on the Amazfit website.- background refresh is enabled for Zepp- I'm not in any Focus/Do not disturb mode of any kind- Zepp is updated to the latest version...- ... and I've verified a bunch of other stuff that they suggestedCan't figure out what's going on.It seems like it only sporadically captures the notifications from my phone, even when the phone is consistently in range. Today it didn't capture any notifications at all between 2:15 and 10:03 pm...  so, what's the deal?? I was getting them at first, and now it seems I'm not getting them at all.Also, the heart rate monitor seems to be wildly inaccurate at times (it measured 72 bpm once when I was whacking weeds with a hoe...).

Amazfit T-Rex Ultra Tactical Smart,"Ok, everybody has terrible bands these days, so I am deducting no points. The band in the picture is the Hēmsut leather band you can get separately.I am converting from a Fitbit Versa 4 that has served me well, but I did it a battery injury while in a hospital bed FOR 2 MONTHS and it now needs to be charged daily to log my heart rhythm and SpO2 levels, which is too easy to forget. I need the hourly logs to have with me for cardiologist visits as we monitor my artificial heart valve, 20 years old and still running!The T-Rex Ultra is OVERKILL for what I want, but I was after the battery life and water resistance (I’ve murdered a couple watches in a swimming pool, finding that “10m water resistance” doesn’t compete with dive ratings) which it covers across the board. I charged it when it arrived, then had to run through 3 firmware upgrades to get to the current OS, Zepp OS 4. That was 3 days ago. The watch, despite having hourly testing on, WiFi active, and live Accuweather running, still has 76% left on the battery. That’s awesome!A lot of the workout tools I have only poked at, not put to use fully, but I am recovering from muscle atrophy following my hospitalization. When the weather warms up, the pup and I will be putting it to use and if there are issues, I’ll come back and add it.Overall, considering I was looking at a Garmin watch for 3 times the cost, I’ve compared capabilities between it (my close friend owns it) and the Amazfit holds a dead even rating. That says a lot!Thus far, I’ve banged the glass into my guitar and the inside of my server with absolutely no scratching.

Amazfit T-Rex Ultra Tactical Smart,"I had every single T-Rex version but this one is definitely top notch. New software, improved interface, 20-day battery life on a regular use, steel case are definitely worth the money.

Apple Watch Series 10,"Upgraded from a series 6 to this series 10. Very glad that I did! The watch itself is much lighter than my previous one, screen is much larger and brighter. I did sacrifice losing out on the blood oxygen level monitor that was included in the series 6 version but that’s not a huge deal for me. The sport watch band with this version is quite thinner than the 6. I was disappointed in that quality but I rarely wear the included rubber sport band. The 10’s battery life lasts longer than the battery life I was getting with the 6 lately. And the 10 charges super quick. So even if I do run the battery down I can quickly recharge it. The auto detection of fitness activity is one of my favs. The series 6 I was using failed to perform that function like it used to. I’ve been careful not to bump the screen of the watch but have once bumped it and didn’t see any scratch or tick in the screen. Seems durable so far. And the best thing of it all if that the expensive, nice watch bands I invested in with my previous watch all fit this version with now issues. That was a concern of mine and would’ve dictated if I returned this version.Like other reviewers, I opened the Amazon delivery box (which was packaged fairly well) and noticed that one loop on the outside of the Apple Watch packaging almost appeared as if it had been previously opened - despite me purchasing a new item. I proceeded forward and noticed that the white thin pull tab stickers on both the watch package and the band package hadn’t been opened. So that was relief. Guess the outside just got shuffled. If you see the pulled tabs on the two inner boxes are still attached, then you know what’s inside will be new.Overall the purchase has been good and I highly recommend the 10.",5.0,Positive,"['upgraded', 'series', 'series', 'glad', 'watch', 'much', 'light', 'previous', 'one', 'screen', 'much', 'large', 'brighter', 'sacrifice', 'lose', 'blood', 'oxygen', 'level', 'monitor', 'include', 'series', 'version', 'thats', 'huge', 'deal', 'sport', 'watch', 'band', 'version', 'quite', 'thinner', 'disappointed', 'quality', 'rarely', 'wear', 'included', 'rubber', 'sport', 'band', 'battery', 'life', 'last', 'long', 'battery', 'life', 'get', 'lately', 'charge', 'super', 'quick', 'even', 'run', 'battery', 'quickly', 'recharge', 'auto', 'detection', 'fitness', 'activity', 'one', 'favs', 'series', 'use', 'fail', 'perform', 'function', 'like', 'use', 'ive', 'careful', 'bump', 'screen', 'watch', 'bump', 'didnt', 'see', 'scratch', 'tick', 'screen', 'seem', 'durable', 'far', 'best', 'thing', 'expensive', 'nice', 'watch', 'band', 'invest', 'previous', 'watch', 'fit', 'version', 'issue', 'concern', 'mine', 'wouldve', 'dictate', 'return', 'versionlike', 'reviewer', 'open', 'amazon', 'delivery', 'box', 'package', 'fairly', 'well', 'noticed', 'one', 'loop', 'outside', 'apple', 'watch', 'packaging', 'almost', 'appear', 'previously', 'open', 'despite', 'purchase', 'new', 'item', 'proceed', 'forward', 'notice', 'white', 'thin', 'pull', 'tab', 'sticker', 'watch', 'package', 'band', 'package', 'hadnt', 'open', 'relief', 'guess', 'outside', 'get', 'shuffled', 'see', 'pull', 'tab', 'two', 'inner', 'box', 'still', 'attach', 'know', 'whats', 'inside', 'newoverall', 'purchase', 'good', 'highly', 'recommend']",upgraded series series glad watch much light previous one screen much large brighter sacrifice lose blood oxygen level monitor include series version thats huge deal sport watch band version quite thinner disappointed quality rarely wear included rubber sport band battery life last long battery life get lately charge super quick even run battery quickly recharge auto detection fitness activity one favs series use fail perform function like use ive careful bump screen watch bump didnt see scratch tick screen seem durable far best thing expensive nice watch band invest previous watch fit version issue concern mine wouldve dictate return versionlike reviewer open amazon delivery box package fairly well noticed one loop outside apple watch packaging almost appear previously open despite purchase new item proceed forward notice white thin pull tab sticker watch package band package hadnt open relief guess outside get shuffled see pull tab two inner box still attach know whats inside newoverall purchase good highly recommend
Apple Watch Series 10,"Awesome upgrade from the SE (2nd Gen) I want to start off with the size. It feels like the body (42mm) is almost the same size as the 40mm AW SE but the screen is bigger due to smaller bezels. The glossy black looks really nice. I haven’t scratched it yet but I’m guessing it will scratch easily. But let’s talk about two upgrades that make it worth it to me.1) Always On Display. The SE (2nd generation) didn’t have it and it’s a huge difference for me. I can see the time and complication data all the time without lifting my wrist. I would also recommend turning off “Raise To Wake” as it’s unnecessary with this feature on. Surprisingly even having the AOD, the battery is pretty good leading into my second favorite part of this watch.2)  Battery. Somehow I’m getting more time out of the battery with the Always On Display than my SE with Raise To Wake. With my old AW, I had to top it off in the morning and at night as it would be at around 20% at the end of the day. So far I’ve been charging this watch to around 90% before I got to bed and still easily getting 24hrs between charges. On top of that it fast charges quickly so basically I stick it on the charger while taking a shower and it’s usually almost fully charged when I get out. I still consider it a 1 day battery so it’s not crazy long if you’re someone who likes to spend days outdoors or whatever. But I just like the fact I don’t have to think too much about the charging. Just throw it on the charger for like 30 minutes and it’s good for a day or so.In short decent screen size, fast charging, battery that lasts at least 24 hrs, and Always On Display.Cons: The battery could still be better. I feel that Apple could focus more on battery and less on making it slimmer than previous watches. I don’t want a bulky watch either but it would be nice to get at least 2-3 days of heavy use between charges. Disappointed that the Blood Oxygen app doesn’t work. I know there’s a lawsuit but it still sucks that the app is downloaded but non functional. If you own a more recent AW this probably isn’t worth it specifically if you already have a modern looking watch with AOD.",4.0,Positive,"['awesome', 'upgrade', 'se', 'nd', 'gen', 'want', 'start', 'size', 'feel', 'like', 'body', 'mm', 'almost', 'size', 'mm', 'aw', 'se', 'screen', 'big', 'due', 'small', 'bezel', 'glossy', 'black', 'look', 'really', 'nice', 'havent', 'scratch', 'yet', 'im', 'guess', 'scratch', 'easily', 'let', 'talk', 'two', 'upgrade', 'make', 'worth', 'always', 'display', 'se', 'nd', 'generation', 'didnt', 'huge', 'difference', 'see', 'time', 'complication', 'data', 'time', 'without', 'lift', 'wrist', 'would', 'also', 'recommend', 'turn', 'raise', 'wake', 'unnecessary', 'feature', 'surprisingly', 'even', 'aod', 'battery', 'pretty', 'good', 'lead', 'second', 'favorite', 'part', 'watch', 'battery', 'somehow', 'im', 'get', 'time', 'battery', 'always', 'display', 'se', 'raise', 'wake', 'old', 'aw', 'top', 'morning', 'night', 'would', 'around', 'end', 'day', 'far', 'ive', 'charge', 'watch', 'around', 'get', 'bed', 'still', 'easily', 'get', 'hr', 'charge', 'top', 'fast', 'charge', 'quickly', 'basically', 'stick', 'charger', 'take', 'shower', 'usually', 'almost', 'fully', 'charge', 'get', 'still', 'consider', 'day', 'battery', 'crazy', 'long', 'youre', 'someone', 'like', 'spend', 'day', 'outdoors', 'whatever', 'like', 'fact', 'dont', 'think', 'much', 'charging', 'throw', 'charger', 'like', 'minute', 'good', 'day', 'soin', 'short', 'decent', 'screen', 'size', 'fast', 'charge', 'battery', 'last', 'least', 'hrs', 'always', 'displaycons', 'battery', 'could', 'still', 'better', 'feel', 'apple', 'could', 'focus', 'battery', 'less', 'make', 'slim', 'previous', 'watch', 'dont', 'want', 'bulky', 'watch', 'either', 'would', 'nice', 'get', 'least', 'day', 'heavy', 'use', 'charge', 'disappoint', 'blood', 'oxygen', 'application', 'doesnt', 'work', 'know', 'theres', 'lawsuit', 'still', 'suck', 'application', 'download', 'non', 'functional', 'recent', 'aw', 'probably', 'isnt', 'worth', 'specifically', 'already', 'modern', 'look', 'watch', 'aod']",awesome upgrade se nd gen want start size feel like body mm almost size mm aw se screen big due small bezel glossy black look really nice havent scratch yet im guess scratch easily let talk two upgrade make worth always display se nd generation didnt huge difference see time complication data time without lift wrist would also recommend turn raise wake unnecessary feature surprisingly even aod battery pretty good lead second favorite part watch battery somehow im get time battery always display se raise wake old aw top morning night would around end day far ive charge watch around get bed still easily get hr charge top fast charge quickly basically stick charger take shower usually almost fully charge get still consider day battery crazy long youre someone like spend day outdoors whatever like fact dont think much charging throw charger like minute good day soin short decent screen size fast charge battery last least hrs always displaycons battery could still better feel apple could focus battery less make slim previous watch dont want bulky watch either would nice get least day heavy use charge disappoint blood oxygen application doesnt work know theres lawsuit still suck application download non functional recent aw probably isnt worth specifically already modern look watch aod
Apple Watch Ultra 2,"Great watch, does everything I want it to except for two things:- The O2 sensor isn't allowed to be used (U.S.)- It needs to be charged constantly.

The cost to value ratio seems to be great.I did get a cover for the watch (tempered glass) and that seems to break a lot. I've gone through 3 or 4 of them already.

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"Now I hate being the type of person to leave a one star review on an item bringing down the overall stars with nothing to do with the item, but the experience I went through. But I don't know where else to leave it so I'm sorry. I don't know if it has happened to anyone else but they swapped my watch somewhere in the process, but my package was not tampered with, just the watch box itself and not the shipping brown box. It had some thicker peel to open tape, the white strip one and even the Milanese loop was exchanged with a refurbished one. Amazon has now refunded my money after almost 3 hours of back and forth calling. The first time I called the customer service rep immediately said I will issue a refund and keep the item but all that was refunded was the shipping, 9 days later still no refund. Called again and then denied the whole refund, said the rep did not get authorized to do so; we're sorry but there's nothing to do anymore. This rep had a hard time understanding that they swapped the item and not that I didn't like the item received and when she did, and insisted it was Apple so I needed to contact them. So I escalated to their manager and he said we will honor it and do this ONE TIME courtesy refund, and I said well this does not give me confidence to keep buying large valued amount items from you then. One time, wow. I said I am an honest person and am not trying to scam anyone here but someone somewhere inside is switching items with refurbished or possibly even their own. Could be from Apple,  Well like I said they made it right, but beware. Overall coming from the Watch 3 series it's a yuuuuge upgrade, I love all the new features, way faster and smoother screen animations , I wish I would have received the black at least to review that one but I am growing fond of this color.

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"I chose this model because of the increased battery. It charges fast, has a low battery mode which extends my battery's charge.Being able to listen to audio books while working at my desk, without the volume being so high as to disturb anyone, is a plus for me.As far as bands go, I find the alpine and the ocean (?) to be preferable, the ocean band being closer to a regular watch band.

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"The Apple Watch Ultra 2 has proven to be a versatile and durable addition to my daily routine. Although my activity levels aren’t as high as they once were, I find its workout tracking capabilities invaluable for my occasional exercise sessions.A standout feature for me is the built-in cellular connectivity.

While charging takes a bit longer, incorporating it into my morning routine ensures the watch is ready for daily use.I also appreciate the sleep tracking feature, which offers valuable insights into my rest patterns.

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"First of all, I like this watch a lot. I had a rough start because it would not pair, and I wrote a negative review. I got that fixed on the second day and all is going on great. Beyond using it as just a watch, I use it for steps, distance, occasionally GPS. I also use the counters and stopwatch often. I could get all these things in a less expensive Apple watch, but I dropped my other Apple watch on a concrete floor and the glass shattered. So, I upgraded.

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"Does everything; I hope it lasts a long time and doesn't need replacing as often as the apple phones do. Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost.

Apple Watch Series 5,"Love love love my “new” watch lol I ordered a stainless steel series 5 in Excellent condition and this watch is amazing! Came in pristine condition, no scratches, everything worked beautifully, setup was a breeze, connected right away to my iPhone 12. Just one issue tho, battery health was teetering just below the guaranteed 80%, that was the only thing, I reached out to the company and their customer service and support was top tier, they offered to replace the watch but everything else was so perfect with it I just didn’t wanna part from it. So me and the company worked it out and came to an agreement that worked best for me and I ended up keeping the watch and receiving a partial refund. With that being said, surprisingly no issues with the battery life so far, keeps a full charge all day and half the night. I work overnights, so sometimes I have my watch on from 9am - 4am that night. Battery makes it thru the day with juice to spare, usually only hits about 35 - 23% by the time I finally get to sit it on the dock. And I do everything with this thing, I run about 2-3 miles per day, have to keep up with a toddler, plus his swim classes, boxing classes and much more. So far, this watch has stood up to the test! The specific seller I purchased from was WOOT, they have great ratings, and really good customer service, I would highly recommend them. Sold by woot, but shipped by Amazon.

Apple Watch Series 5,"Do not purchase these watches, read the reviews. 3 watches, all duds.TLDR: I bought 3 of these watches that all had issues and now have to wait up to 30 days for a refund I may not receive. I am confident they are replacing the glass on these watches sub par and then making them no longer waterproof.  Once they have water damage, they say they will not refund your money, despite Apple watches being “swim proof” according to the site.  The watches said they were sold by “woot” but then the box instructions had a different seller.I bought 3 of these watches for my kids about 10 days ago.  From the start I had concerns because it seemed like they would not charge to 100% and set up was a little clunky.  I also read previous reviews about the glass breaking easy, so I put screen protectors on them immediately.  I have had an apple watch since they first came out, replacing them every 2-3 years, so I am have some experience of their capabilities and how they feel.  In 10 years I have never once broken the glass on a watch and I do not wear screen protectors and I am your typical “klutz”.  I agree with another reviewer that these watch glasses are not being replaced with apple quality glass but I am not an expert.Here is the issue with each watchThis watch never charged higher than 94% despite the battery health being greater than 85%.  I thought maybe it was the generic charger so I charged it with my apple watch charger.  This did not fix the issue, and it would still never charge higher than 94% usually stopped around 91% even overnight.  Within 5-6 hours of use we were getting low battery warnings despite using in low power mode all day.I thought we were going to be able to keep this watch, everything seemed to be going well, it charged to 100%, the battery lasted about 10 hours.  Then suddenly it appeared to not turn on and the screen started glitching on and off.  There were no visible signs of damage to the screen or the watch.  However, the screen always felt off and we would have issues with touching and typing on the watch.  He did wear this in the shower.This watch had similar issues to the first watch with battery and maintaining a charge.  However, my son was in the shower and suddenly the watch kept making emergency calls over and over.  So he gets out of the shower and I take off the screen protector and the glass is cracked, despite no damage at all to the screen protector (see photos).  Similar to watch 2, something always felt “off “ about this screen as well.We will see how this all plays out in the next 30 days and I may update my review more positively if the seller stands by their product.  But for now, I cannot recommend anyone taking the risk on these 100% functional refurbished watches.

The primary appeal of this purchase was the notable cost reduction compared to a new device, and in terms of core functionality, the watch has largely delivered on its promise. The operational performance mirrors that of a new Series 5, exhibiting the expected responsiveness, a high-quality display, comprehensive health and fitness tracking, and seamless integration within the Apple ecosystem.A point of concern, however, arose upon receipt of the product. The watch was packaged solely with the larger of the standard band sizes. Regrettably, this band proved to be unsuitable for my wrist size, necessitating the immediate procurement of a smaller, compatible band. While the initial price point of the refurbished unit was attractive, the unavoidable additional expense for a properly sized band somewhat offsets the initial cost savings.Notwithstanding this issue concerning the provided accessory, the fundamental performance of the refurbished Apple Watch Series 5 has been satisfactory. All advertised features, including GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, and application compatibility, have operated consistently and reliably. Furthermore, the physical condition of the device suggests careful refurbishment, with minimal discernible signs of previous use.In summary, the refurbished Apple Watch Series 5 offers a financially prudent option for individuals seeking the features and capabilities of this particular smartwatch model. While prospective buyers should be prepared for the potential need to purchase a separate band to ensure optimal fit and comfort, the core device itself performs as expected and provides the anticipated user experience.",4.0,Positive,"['recent', 'acquisition', 'refurbish', 'apple', 'watch', 'series', 'present', 'interesting', 'balance', 'value', 'minor', 'logistical', 'challenge', 'primary', 'appeal', 'purchase', 'notable', 'cost', 'reduction', 'compare', 'new', 'device', 'term', 'core', 'functionality', 'watch', 'largely', 'deliver', 'promise', 'operational', 'performance', 'mirror', 'new', 'series', 'exhibit', 'expected', 'responsiveness', 'highquality', 'display', 'comprehensive', 'health', 'fitness', 'track', 'seamless', 'integration', 'within', 'apple', 'ecosystema', 'point', 'concern', 'however', 'arise', 'upon', 'receipt', 'product', 'watch', 'package', 'solely', 'large', 'standard', 'band', 'size', 'regrettably', 'band', 'prove', 'unsuitable', 'wrist', 'size', 'necessitate', 'immediate', 'procurement', 'small', 'compatible', 'band', 'initial', 'price', 'point', 'refurbish', 'unit', 'attractive', 'unavoidable', 'additional', 'expense', 'properly', 'size', 'band', 'somewhat', 'offset', 'initial', 'cost', 'savingsnotwithstanding', 'issue', 'concern', 'provide', 'accessory', 'fundamental', 'performance', 'refurbish', 'apple', 'watch', 'series', 'satisfactory', 'advertise', 'feature', 'include', 'global positioning system', 'track', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitoring', 'application', 'compatibility', 'operate', 'consistently', 'reliably', 'furthermore', 'physical', 'condition', 'device', 'suggest', 'careful', 'refurbishment', 'minimal', 'discernible', 'sign', 'previous', 'usein', 'summary', 'refurbish', 'apple', 'watch', 'series', 'offer', 'financially', 'prudent', 'option', 'individual', 'seek', 'feature', 'capability', 'particular', 'smartwatch', 'model', 'prospective', 'buyer', 'prepare', 'potential', 'need', 'purchase', 'separate', 'band', 'ensure', 'optimal', 'fit', 'comfort', 'core', 'device', 'performs', 'expect', 'provide', 'anticipated', 'user', 'experience']",recent acquisition refurbish apple watch series present interesting balance value minor logistical challenge primary appeal purchase notable cost reduction compare new device term core functionality watch largely deliver promise operational performance mirror new series exhibit expected responsiveness highquality display comprehensive health fitness track seamless integration within apple ecosystema point concern however arise upon receipt product watch package solely large standard band size regrettably band prove unsuitable wrist size necessitate immediate procurement small compatible band initial price point refurbish unit attractive unavoidable additional expense properly size band somewhat offset initial cost savingsnotwithstanding issue concern provide accessory fundamental performance refurbish apple watch series satisfactory advertise feature include global positioning system track heart rate monitoring application compatibility operate consistently reliably furthermore physical condition device suggest careful refurbishment minimal discernible sign previous usein summary refurbish apple watch series offer financially prudent option individual seek feature capability particular smartwatch model prospective buyer prepare potential need purchase separate band ensure optimal fit comfort core device performs expect provide anticipated user experience

Apple Watch Series 7,"The watch came in very good condition. No major scuffs or scratches. Only some very very minor imperfections that are barely noticeable.I was nervous at first because it was very difficult to get the watch to hold a charge. It was barely charging at all the first hour or so, stuck at about 30%. I left it alone and in low power mode for about 2 hours and once it made it to 50%, it updated to the latest version and started gradually charging normally. The battery health is definitely not the best and it could probably be replaced, but it is still very much functional as is.I’ve had it for a few weeks now, and it charges pretty quick, like within an hour to 80%. The charge lasts a long while. I’m a nurse and it can last longer than a 12 hour shift on a full charge. it helps to use Low power mode. I have not had any other issues with it so far.

Apple Watch Series 7,"After trying it for 3 weeks. I finally decided to return it. And here is why, and hopefully it will help someone who is planning to buy it. It could be a keeper for you but unfortunately not for me.Good part:The conditions of the watch itself is pretty good. There is no scratch or damage. Watch functions no problem, everything works pretty good. Plus it is cellular version.Bad part:None of the accessories are original, including band and charger plugs box. Which is actually pretty upset for me since I thought for an excellent condition watch at least some original parts. The charger comes with it has a crack on it and not factory. Which means it can’t fast charge the watch. Also it generates a lot of heat which feels pretty dangerous for me. Also the battery health is only 83% which is a lot worse than I thought.Overall I realized I really don’t need cellular, and without fast charging charger and only 83% battery health. It can barely last a day if want to track your sleep. And you need to spare some time for charging. Considering now you can get a brand new SE2 for the same price.

I decided to buy the RENEWED apple watch that stated looks like new and I must say I am SURPRISED that it works and looks new it came packaged well and with a charging cord. It is always a risk buying anything refurbished so I was not expecting much.  I must say I am really happy I decided to go with the renewed refurbished no scratches no dents the band is new that it came with, IPaired it and waited 2 days to write  my review. The key to sabing battery life is to put your watch on low battery it saves the battery I did that with my other apple watch.  The reason why my other apple watch broke was due to me removing the bands every day and dropping the apple watch to many times. Lets see how long this one last. I decided not to change the bands everyday on this one and try not to drop it frequently. This should last until I get an iphone upgrade and watch.

Apple Watch Series 6,"I wish I had images- I would have if they had not readily accepted my request to return they day it arrived. This product is advertised as excellent condition- it could not be further from that. To begin, a came with some minor scratches- okay, that's not too big a deal, I'm gonna buy a case for it anyway. Then, as I am setting up the watch , I notice that the screen physically moves into the watch as I press buttons. It was pretty dark in my room, so I turn on the lights, take a closer look and it appears that either A) The screen had come off and they had tried to glue it back together with the equivalent of elementary Elmer's glue OR B) The Apple Watch adhesive had been extremely used and worn out- to the point where the adhesive was ""leaking"" over the edges of the screen- something fatal they failed to inspect. I am almost sure it is the former given that the adhesive seems it was applied as the real apple watch adhesive is located inside the lining of the screen rather than on its outside edges. Obviously, this scenario is far worse and demonstrates the carelessness of this company. This I presume would be a major compromise of the waterproof aspect of the watch as under the screen, all of the mechanics are exposed to the elements. Cases are often not waterproof either for the Apple Watch since the watch itself is already waterproof, so that would not fix the issue. Now, I did request to refund the day of, reporting the exact issue, and wow! They accepted! Happy Ending! Not quite.As you might expect, the customer service was not great either.I will admit that I physically returned it a few weeks after- I was terribly busy and this apple watch that I was already promised a refund for was not at the top of my list of concerns. By the way- the deadline was in late December. I had returned it in the first third of the time they wanted it back. Fast-forward, and I see that they had charged me a ""restocking fee"" of HALF OF PRICE OF THE WATCH. I payed $270 for this ""excellent condition"" device only to be dealt a hole of $135 in the wallet. I was essentially paying to repair the watch, and for them to sell it to another poor soul. The cost to actually repair it is much cheaper by the way, and you could probably do a better job. Nowhere do they mention a restocking fee, especialIy not such a large one. I, obviously angry, had to control myself when talking to their customer service- which was hardly a service and more of an insult. I asked for a full refund in what one would consider polite given the circumstances. Here's the kicker. They had the AUDACITY to claim that I, MYSELF, had broken it because it was not returned immediately after receival. Don't be mistaken, they would likely come up with another excuse to only refund you half of your money even if you returned it earlier than myself. The apple watch was not used a single day after my initial complaint, yet the customer service had the incredible nerve to claim that it was my fault. They somehow believe that I had bought the watch, and planned to break and return it. They genuinely believe that somebody would buy the watch and report damage the day after so that they could use it for a month, THEN break it in the exact way as described, THEN return it. Not even a legitimate scammer would plan that- logically, its just not cost efficient, practical, or useful. The customer service was vague and almost condescending.Just because they have some sort of Amazon Renewed Certification does not mean it will be anywhere close to ""like new"" or excellent folks. You would think that for a company selling the same items tagged in progressively ascending order of quality (They have the same watch at different prices for ""good"" ""Very Good"" and ""Excellent"") would have an at least decent ""Excellent"" option. What an absolute joke and a horrible experience to ruin my week.Just don't risk it. Heads you get an overpriced used Apple Watch.

Apple Watch Series 7,"If I could give ZERO STARS, I WOULD. This is hands down the WORST purchase I have ever made on Amazon. I bought this pre-owned Apple Watch in October, and from DAY ONE, the screen started peeling off. NOT EVEN A MONTH IN, and the watch was falling apart before my eyes. This is not normal wear and tear—this is cheap, lazy, bare-minimum refurbishment meant to last JUST long enough to clear the 30-day return window.I reached out to the seller?

This seller is running a quick-cash scam, selling barely-functioning products, and banking on the fact that you won’t notice the defects in time.If you see ANY AIR BUBBLES under your screen, RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY. Don’t convince yourself that it’s nothing—it means your watch is already breaking apart. And don’t expect a refund, because once you’re past that return window, you are stuck with their garbage.I don’t care if they sell this watch for HALF PRICE—it’s NOT WORTH IT. Whether it’s for you, a loved one, young or old, this will ONLY cause frustration and disappointment. Your money is TOO HARD-EARNED to waste on a scam.From now on, I’M ONLY BUYING FROM APPLE DIRECTLY.

Apple Watch Series 7,"Needed a newer Apple Watch so I can do ecgs to share with my doctor. I didn’t want to shell out a shirt load of money for a new one. Saw these renewed ones for a fraction of the price. I ordered one and 2 days later, it showed up. It was in a plain box and had a charger with it. Good thing because it was dead as I’ve ever seen anything dead. It charged up in an hour or so I could get it set up.I inspected it. There are wear marks on the case and crown but the face was fine. I put a screen and case protector on it and it looks fine.I checked the battery life and it’s down to 85%. I’m sure that’s going to be fine. I know it can be replaced it I want to later.The sports band is not an Apple product but I don’t care. I quit buying Apple Watch bands years ago. I can buy 3 or 4 of these perfectly fine knockoffs for the price of one Apple.Other than the scuffs and battery it works as it should.Down with overpriced stuff and thumbs up for cheaper rebuilt semi quality stuff. Kinda like a rebuilt transmission.*****UPDATE*****As for the functionality of the watch, it's fine except for the battery life.  I have to charge it part way through the day IF I want it to last all day.  On more than one occasion, by 4:00 pm, I got the 10% battery left message and then it is dead until I get it on a charger.  Now, I'm going to have to spend $100 to get the battery replaced.AND - the watch charger that came with it, does not work.  Yes, I took the piece of plastic off of it before trying it out.  I'm beginning to regret my purchase.I guess I could see if I can replace the battery myself but I don't want to perform surgery on a piece of electronics at my age.  The battery will be around $25 and the tool kit will be around $30 plus shipping and handling.  Still saving money though.  Maybe I can start a side hustle replacing apple watch batteries and save enough to go on vacation in the tropics or buy a small can of pineapple juice.Buyers remorse is setting in. REMOVE A STAR!*****UPDATE #2*****Found a video tutorial that walked me through turning off a number of the functions of the watch to save on battery.  I am pleased to report that after doing that, I can now wear it 10 or 11 hours and the watch will still have mid 70's battery left.  I shouldn't have to do this but I did so Now I can wear it and not worry about taking a charger to work with me so I can charge it over my lunch break.",3.0,Neutral,"['need', 'newer', 'apple', 'watch', 'ecg', 'share', 'doctor', 'didnt', 'want', 'shell', 'shirt', 'load', 'money', 'new', 'one', 'saw', 'renew', 'one', 'fraction', 'price', 'order', 'one', 'day', 'later', 'show', 'plain', 'box', 'charger', 'good', 'thing', 'dead', 'ive', 'ever', 'see', 'anything', 'dead', 'charge', 'hour', 'could', 'get', 'set', 'upi', 'inspected', 'wear', 'mark', 'case', 'crown', 'face', 'fine', 'put', 'screen', 'case', 'protector', 'look', 'finei', 'check', 'battery', 'life', 'im', 'sure', 'thats', 'go', 'fine', 'know', 'replace', 'want', 'laterthe', 'sport', 'band', 'apple', 'product', 'dont', 'care', 'quit', 'buy', 'apple', 'watch', 'band', 'year', 'ago', 'buy', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'knockoff', 'price', 'one', 'appleother', 'scuff', 'battery', 'work', 'shoulddown', 'overpriced', 'stuff', 'thumb', 'cheaper', 'rebuilt', 'semi', 'quality', 'stuff', 'kinda', 'like', 'rebuilt', 'transmissionupdateas', 'functionality', 'watch', 'fine', 'except', 'battery', 'life', 'charge', 'part', 'way', 'day', 'want', 'last', 'day', 'one', 'occasion', 'prime minister', 'get', 'battery', 'leave', 'message', 'dead', 'get', 'charger', 'im', 'go', 'spend', 'get', 'battery', 'replacedand', 'watch', 'charger', 'come', 'work', 'yes', 'take', 'piece', 'plastic', 'try', 'im', 'begin', 'regret', 'purchasei', 'guess', 'could', 'see', 'replace', 'battery', 'dont', 'want', 'perform', 'surgery', 'piece', 'electronics', 'age', 'battery', 'around', 'tool', 'kit', 'around', 'plus', 'ship', 'handle', 'still', 'save', 'money', 'though', 'maybe', 'start', 'side', 'hustle', 'replace', 'apple', 'watch', 'battery', 'save', 'enough', 'go', 'vacation', 'tropic', 'buy', 'small', 'pineapple', 'juicebuyers', 'remorse', 'set', 'remove', 'starupdate', 'find', 'video', 'tutorial', 'walk', 'turn', 'number', 'function', 'watch', 'save', 'battery', 'pleased', 'report', 'wear', 'hour', 'watch', 'still', 'mid', 'battery', 'leave', 'shouldnt', 'wear', 'worry', 'take', 'charger', 'work', 'charge', 'lunch', 'break']",need newer apple watch ecg share doctor didnt want shell shirt load money new one saw renew one fraction price order one day later show plain box charger good thing dead ive ever see anything dead charge hour could get set upi inspected wear mark case crown face fine put screen case protector look finei check battery life im sure thats go fine know replace want laterthe sport band apple product dont care quit buy apple watch band year ago buy perfectly fine knockoff price one appleother scuff battery work shoulddown overpriced stuff thumb cheaper rebuilt semi quality stuff kinda like rebuilt transmissionupdateas functionality watch fine except battery life charge part way day want last day one occasion prime minister get battery leave message dead get charger im go spend get battery replacedand watch charger come work yes take piece plastic try im begin regret purchasei guess could see replace battery dont want perform surgery piece electronics age battery around tool kit around plus ship handle still save money though maybe start side hustle replace apple watch battery save enough go vacation tropic buy small pineapple juicebuyers remorse set remove starupdate find video tutorial walk turn number function watch save battery pleased report wear hour watch still mid battery leave shouldnt wear worry take charger work charge lunch break

Apple Watch Series 6,"UPDATE:  I have now had the watch for roughly 2 months.  I’ve decided to knock out an update a month early.This watch is incredible.  I have done the following since having the watch:SwimmingCold plungingWorking out (weights)RunningSleeping (sleep monitoring)CampingHot tubOutdoor work (chopping wood, cleaning a nasty chicken coop, setting up a treestand)HikingDishesShoweringGardeningWake boardingPaddle boardingKayakingCliff jumpingFree diving (to 20-25 feet)I’m sure there is more but I wanted to emphasize I’ve done A LOT with this watch.  I also did a run on the beach but I took the watch off when going in the ocean.  I possibly didn’t need to but salt water is just so corrosive I didn’t want to risk it.This watch has performed flawlessly the entire time.  I’m more than impressed.  My son bought one of these new when they first came out and paid double what I paid.My cons list is short: (and really not the seller but the watch itself)I didn’t realize if you have a tattoo where the sensor sits it will not read correctly.  I thought something was wrong with my watch but did a little research and found it was the tattoos on my wrist…I verified this by moving the watch to an area with then without and watching the watch shut off.  I now choke the watch up a little closer to my hand (which can be annoying sometimes when working out) and it works perfectly.  Also…I think sunscreen might affect the sensor as well.  I had sunscreen on and the watch was doing a similar thing that it did with the tattoo.  I wiped the sensor and my wrist off and it started working fine.Lastly I do wish the watch came with a little better charger…the one they sent me works just fine but it’s slow as can be.  The charger my son has charges our watched in 1.5-2 hours.Overall…everything I’ve said below is just as (if not more) relevant.  I wouldn’t hesitate to buy this watch again.  I’m extremely satisfied.I would have shared a picture or 2 but amazon asked permission to all my pictures and that isn’t happening.I’m writing this knowing I’ve only had the watch for 3 days.  I plan to update my review before the 90 day return runs out and after I’ve had more time with the watch.I got this watch specifically from seller prime mobility.  They have very high feedback ratings so I was happy to take a chance with them in this watch.  I bought the watch in “like new” condition.  The seller was prompt with shipping and communication.  At this point I would recommend them highly.The watch: blue series 6I did a lot of research on what watch to get for fitness and overall health.  It seems with all my research, for people who aren’t super techy and have an iPhone the Apple Watch is the way to go.  I’ve never owned an apple or any other smart watch/smart device.  I wanted this to track my 5 day a week gym workouts, sleep, and heart rate with running, meditation, and cold plunging.I honestly only have 1 con at this point.  The watch came with a sticker right on the health tracker and the glue was annoying (really not hard just annoying) to have to remove.The pros are many: the watch came with %100 battery health witch I was surprised about.  I’ve been using it and I’ve only had to charge it every 1.5 days.  It also looks great.  No visible issues, problems, blemishes at all.  Lastly, the first day I had it I did a 10 minute cold plunge.  The watch was under water for 10 minutes and had no issues.  The watch quality meets my expectations completely and even exceeded them regarding battery life.  I’m incredibly happy with my purchase.  I can’t speak for other sellers but I feel prime mobility did me well in this purchase.  Again, I will be updating my review before the 90 day return runs out but at this point I don’t have any concerns or apprehensions.",5.0,Positive,"['update', 'watch', 'roughly', 'month', 'ive',

Apple Watch Series 6,I never owned an Apple Watch until I had to switch back to an iPhone. I was looking around and found the series 6. I wanted an older series but some of them were surprisingly expensive and I think I was looking at a series 7 and that was pricey as well. I got this at an excellent price to be fair.

Apple Watch Series 6,"I purchased this ""renewed in excellent condition"" Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm Aluminum) in October 2024 as a Christmas gift for my husband. He was thrilled at first, and the watch appeared to be in great condition. Unfortunately, we now realize that the product quality was only surface-deep.He had less than two weeks to truly vet the watch before the 3-month return window ended on January 9. On June 23—his first time wearing it into a swimming pool—the watch completely died. It has not turned on since. Apple clearly advertises this model as water resistant up to 50 meters, so this should have been a non-issue.After examining the watch, it's obvious the failure was due to poor workmanship during the ""renewal"" process. The casing still looks pristine with no dents or cracks, but water somehow got in. I can literally hear it sloshing inside—proof it wasn’t properly resealed during refurbishment.When I contacted the seller, they refused to help since the return window had closed months earlier. That’s extremely frustrating, especially given that the defect wasn’t something that could have been detected earlier without intentionally submerging it.I strongly caution others against trusting the “renewed” label from this seller.

Apple Watch Se,"It came in a plain box. I have never owned much less seen an Apple Watch before but it was way past time for a new watch. Since I’ve owned an iPhone for a few years now I thought I’d take the dive and buy one. It isn’t the latest on the market but how would I know that? I got it because of the health benefits. It can even map my steps like when I walk my dog. That’s something my fitbit never did. I can change the watch face to anything in the watch library.It was super easy to pair with my phone. I started charging it as soon as I got the watch band put on. I even got a watch face protector and put that on before I got it set up to charge.It says it’s supposed to take 2.5 hours to charge to full but I think because I ended up updating and syncing and pairing it with my iPhone it didn’t charge full in that time. So I was impatient and started wearing it at 58% charged. I read you’re not supposed to let it drain down to zero or it could ruin your battery. Also that it’s ok to charge over night because there is a shutoff when it is full. Same with an iPhone which I did not know. Learn something new everyday right?The other thing I learned is I don’t need to add it to my phone like add another line and pay $10 extra just so I can answer my phone with my watch and leave my phone at home. Since I retired I don’t use my phone enough to warrant that service.I like that I can add my meds I take and set an alarm for them. There’s a lot of stuff that I like about the fitness and health aspect of it.I’m still learning about it and there’s so much to learn. The easiest thing was pairing it with my phone because once it was charged enough to turn on it did and my phone was sitting nearby and it flashed a screen quickly all I seen was click pair phone and the screen changed because I was downloading watch faces. I like that there is an instruction manual linked so if you have questions you can click on the manual link and open the booklet. It’s really small print so you have to pinch the screen to enlarge it big enough to read on your phone.It reads in the manual that the battery drains faster when you have more apps on it working and open. Like : notify for text messages; automatic downloads, those kinds of things and you can turn them off so it doesn’t drain your battery as fast.It’s supposed to last 18 hours from a full charge but that depends on usage. Like do you FaceTime often, use it for phone calls instead of phone, listening to music/podcasts? Because if so that cuts down on the 18hr charge time.I read that these watches can last up to 5-6 years before they don’t work no more and that’s if you take care of it properly. Batteries can be replaced. Bands are interchangeable. I recommend getting a screen protector for the watch face. It’s easy to snap on.I think because I bought excellent condition refurbished which is kinda like brand new at least I think it is, that I won’t have the problems I see other people having like only working for a few months or not charging after a week. That charger is small and I am not sure exactly where to set it. The screen goes black after a few seconds so I don’t know if it’s charging. I’m sure there’s a way to see from my phone but like I said I just got it today and just barely finished setting it up as best I could with everything I think I can.So far I’m loving the watch! I’m a former android user slowly over the past 10 years I been moving over to Apple products. This watch being my latest piece to my collection.My best advice when shopping refurbished is are you really going to buy an acceptable item because it’s even cheaper than the good, or excellent? And then come complain because it arrived with scratches or something. You get what you pay for I was always told.

Apple Watch Ultra,"It was time to buy an Apple Watch.  The Ultra seemed to have all the features and *in my mind* the smaller ""regular"" models were a compromise of sorts.  But the new Ultra II watches are VERY expensive.  Not in my budget and in my mind not a good value.  But I think I found the value I needed.I researched Ultra I vs Ultra II (and the Series 10) watches and decided that while the Ultra II has more features and a ""faster processor"", these weren't things that I *needed*.  It came with features that are not automtically included with the Series 10 watches such as titanium frame. An extra control button, and a few minor other things.It appeared that the ""renewed"" watches seemed to have a good track record and one came along with a band that I liked and I jumped on it.I like this watch.  Big learning curve, but I'm settling in.  The unit I received seems to be in perfect condition, with a plastic protector over the face. No scratches or any marks that I can see. The one thing that surprised me, but just a little, is that it came in a crappy generic box. Nothing like how Apple packages their products. But I won't be wearing the box, so who cares.  It also came with a little charging disk/cord that looks like an EKG sensor.  The charging thing works, but I bought an inexpensive night stand charger which I like.One of the ingenious things about the Apple Watch is their approach to watch bands.  I like the one that came with it, but to change a band is easy and takes only seconds.  I ordered 3 more bands, but just sent back on.  So many to choose from. The bands change the whole character of the watch, and I can set matching watch faces.  So much fun to be able to take one watch and inexpensively give it so many looks.I reserve 5 star rating for only outstanding products.  I give this 4.5 stars, because the cheap packaging ruined the overall gestalt of receiving a watch that costs this much money.",4.0,Positive,"['time', 'buy', 'apple', 'watch', 'ultra', 'seem', 'feature', 'mind', 'small', 'regular', 'model', 'compromise', 'sort', 'new', 'ultra', 'ii', 'watch', 'expensive', 'budget', 'mind', 'good', 'value', 'think', 'find', 'value', 'neededi', 'research', 'ultra', 'v', 'ultra', 'ii', 'series', 'watch', 'decide', 'ultra', 'ii', 'feature', 'faster', 'processor', 'werent', 'thing', 'need', 'come', 'feature', 'automtically', 'include', 'series', 'watch', 'titanium', 'frame', 'extra', 'control', 'button', 'minor', 'thingsit', 'appear', 'renew', 'watch', 'seem', 'good', 'track', 'record', 'one', 'come', 'along', 'band', 'like', 'jumped', 'iti', 'like', 'watch', 'big', 'learning', 'curve', 'im', 'settle', 'unit', 'receive', 'seem', 'perfect', 'condition', 'plastic', 'protector', 'face', 'scratch', 'mark', 'see', 'one', 'thing', 'surprise', 'little', 'come', 'crappy', 'generic', 'box', 'nothing', 'like', 'apple', 'package', 'product', 'wont', 'wear', 'box', 'care', 'also', 'come', 'little', 'charge', 'diskcord', 'look', 'like', 'ekg', 'sensor', 'charge', 'thing', 'work', 'buy', 'inexpensive', 'night', 'stand', 'charger', 'likeone', 'ingenious', 'thing', 'apple', 'watch', 'approach', 'watch', 'band', 'like', 'one', 'come', 'change', 'band', 'easy', 'take', 'second', 'ordered', 'band', 'send', 'back', 'many', 'choose', 'band', 'change', 'whole', 'character', 'watch', 'set', 'matching', 'watch', 'face', 'much', 'fun', 'able', 'take', 'one', 'watch', 'inexpensively', 'give', 'many', 'looksi', 'reserve', 'star', 'rating', 'outstanding', 'product', 'give', 'star', 'cheap', 'packaging', 'ruin', 'overall', 'gestalt', 'receive', 'watch', 'cost', 'much', 'money']",time buy apple watch ultra seem feature mind small regular model compromise sort new ultra ii watch expensive budget mind good value think find value neededi research ultra v ultra ii series watch decide ultra ii feature faster processor werent thing need come feature automtically include series watch titanium frame extra control button minor thingsit appear renew watch seem good track record one come along band like jumped iti like watch big learning curve im settle unit receive seem perfect condition plastic protector face scratch mark see one thing surprise little come crappy generic box nothing like apple package product wont wear box care also come little charge diskcord look like ekg sensor charge thing work buy inexpensive night stand charger likeone ingenious thing apple watch approach watch band like one come change band easy take second ordered band send back many choose band change whole character watch set matching watch face much fun able take one watch inexpensively give many looksi reserve star rating outstanding product give star cheap packaging ruin overall gestalt receive watch cost much money
Apple Watch Ultra,"I recently decided to upgrade my smartwatch and was torn between a refurbished Apple Watch Ultra (AWU) and the Apple Watch Series 10 Cellular. After some deliberation, I chose the AWU, and I’m glad I did.The watch arrived in pristine condition—no scratches, dents, or signs of prior use. The battery health was at 91%, which is virtually new. It came with the Ocean Band, which was brand new and adds to the premium feel of the watch. While the included 1m Magnetic Charging Cable didn’t seem to be an original Apple product, it wasn’t a deal-breaker for me.Setting up the watch was a breeze. Adding it to my US Mobile account was straightforward, and as a Premium customer, there’s no extra charge for Apple Watch connectivity—a fantastic perk! The watch performed flawlessly when making calls, sending texts, and streaming music. Everything worked as advertised, and the experience has been seamless so far.Overall, I’m thrilled with my decision. The Apple Watch Ultra offers premium features and durability at an excellent value.

The battery life easily lasts all day and it's on a mix of cellular and wifi with no issues.The screen is scratch free and the touch functionally works well. We had no issues hooking up the cellular aspect and pairing the watch.In addition to the nondescript packaging, the watch came with an aftermarket black band with two length options, and a charger.

Apple Watch Series 8,"This watch has all the bells and whistles of a new apple watch but without the price tag. LOVE A REFURBISHED Deal. Felt good rehoming this beauty.Battery life is Ok, had to get used to charging it every two days. I went from a fitbit to an applewatch and there is for sure a learning curve. Both with the functionality and the user interface. I used it as I was training for a marathon. It monitored all my health metrics and alerted when I was in need of a rest day. The fit was great, and I chose to protect the touch screen with a cover. It limits the functionality slightly. But the benefits greatly outweigh the drawbacks.

Apple Watch Series 8,"Physical condition was totally fine in appearance, no scratches or anything. But things you should know:1. The battery health shows max charge of 83%, which is not great. According to the Amazon Renewed info page, this falls short of the ""Premium"" and ""Excellent"" condition, placing it in the ""Good"" category if we only look at battery health metric.2. The charging cable it came with is terrible, super cheap and takes ages to charge. It may be ""good enough"" to do in a pinch, but expecting to spend an additional $30 or so for a proper one (especially considering the limited battery capacity).3. The ECG works on only about 1/10 attempts. The rest of the time it glitches out. Idk whether this issue is on Apple's end with an unreliable app, or whether the hardware supporting this feature is degraded on the device itself. I suspect the internals to measure this are fragile and susceptible to damage from drops.4. Verizon customers, beware: I have been unable to connect cellular service (see image). Unclear whether this is an issue on Verizon's end, or if the ""Renewing"" process didn't also clear up associations with the device's IMEI number (i.e. it's already been bound to another carrier or something).

Apple Watch Series 8,"The Series 8 Apple Watch works flawlessly.  No problems with the watch.  Outside case and watch crystal had no scratches and looked like new.  I needed to upgrade to Watch OS 10.3 but that went very quickly.  Pairing with iPhone wasn’t a problem either.  Battery health measured 99%.  The ONLY issue that I had was with the enclosed wireless watch charger that came with the watch.  This charger was NOT an Apple or certified Apple charger.  This was an unmarked, no company name or logo 3rd party unit from Asia.  This charger would literally “cook” the watch when in use.  Thanks to Apple for installing a thermal shutdown in the watch otherwise I would of had a lithium battery fire on my kitchen counter.  The watch would shutdown the charging process but still was very “hot” to the touch.  Some of these wireless battery chargers are ONLY rated for 5W using USB-C.  Good luck finding a 5W power unit.  I had one from an old Apple 6 phone that I was able to use and purchased a USB-A male to USB-C female adaptor to use as a watch charger unit.  DO NOT USE THE STANDARD 20W OR LARGER POWER UNITS.  Thermal shutdown will happen during charging.  Please don’t leave the watch unattended while using these non-standard, un-certified wireless chargers.Overall I am very happy with the purchase with pricing point that I paid.

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"Amazon reviewI've never owned a smart watch because I'm really hard on watches and I just thought they were expensive, fragile gadgets. When my wife got one for health reasons, I saw how useful the watch was and how many ways I could use it.I started looking on Amazon, found the refurbished watches on Woot (Amazon) , found a good price on an Ultra 2 gps+cellular and ordered one. I really love this watch. I love the bigger face, longer battery life and extra features. As stated in the description, the watch was in excellent condition.After it arrived, I wore it a couple of days to make sure it was what I wanted and that it felt good on my wrist. I liked wearing the watch. I ordered a watch face protector because of my bad luck of banging my watches into every hard object I get near. The protector fits great and isn't noticeable on the watch. I also ordered a heavier duty watch band so I wouldn't lose it  during hikes and bike rides.I use it for monitoring my health and tracking my sleep and exercise routine. It is easy to start and finish any type of exercise you know of and many you don't. Knowing how much exercise I'm actually doing during the day keeps me from sitting in the chair too long. It also makes it fun competing against myself.I put the watch on my cellular service and it works well. I enjoy having access to my phone and many apps without bringing my iPhone.Based on my experience, I definitely recommend the refurb watch. No problems and it came in an excellent, like new condition. I also recommend the Ultra 2 for watch face size, longer battery and low power mode, brighter screen, waterproof depth and ruggedness.",5.0,Positive,"['amazon', 'reviewive', 'never', 'own', 'smart', 'watch', 'im', 'really', 'hard', 'watch', 'think', 'expensive', 'fragile', 'gadget', 'wife', 'get', 'one', 'health', 'reason', 'saw', 'useful', 'watch', 'many', 'way', 'could', 'use', 'iti', 'start', 'look', 'amazon', 'find', 'refurbished', 'watch', 'woot', 'amazon', 'found', 'good', 'price', 'ultra', 'gpscellular', 'order', 'one', 'really', 'love', 'watch', 'love', 'big', 'face', 'longer', 'battery', 'life', 'extra', 'feature', 'state', 'description', 'watch', 'excellent', 'conditionafter', 'arrive', 'wore', 'couple', 'day', 'make', 'sure', 'want', 'felt', 'good', 'wrist', 'like', 'wearing', 'watch', 'order', 'watch', 'face', 'protector', 'bad', 'luck', 'banging', 'watch', 'every', 'hard', 'object', 'get', 'near', 'protector', 'fit', 'great', 'isnt', 'noticeable', 'watch', 'also', 'order', 'heavy', 'duty', 'watch', 'band', 'wouldnt', 'lose', 'hike', 'bike', 'ridesi', 'use', 'monitoring', 'health', 'track', 'sleep', 'exercise', 'routine', 'easy', 'start', 'finish', 'type', 'exercise', 'know', 'many', 'dont', 'know', 'much', 'exercise', 'im', 'actually', 'day', 'keep', 'sit', 'chair', 'long', 'also', 'make', 'fun', 'compete', 'myselfi', 'put', 'watch', 'cellular', 'service', 'work', 'well', 'enjoy', 'access', 'phone', 'many', 'application', 'without', 'bring', 'iphonebased', 'experience', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'refurb', 'watch', 'problem', 'come', 'excellent', 'like', 'new', 'condition', 'also', 'recommend', 'ultra', 'watch', 'face', 'size', 'longer', 'battery', 'low', 'power', 'mode', 'brighter', 'screen', 'waterproof', 'depth', 'ruggedness']",amazon reviewive never own smart watch im really hard watch think expensive fragile gadget wife get one health reason saw useful watch many way could use iti start look amazon find refurbished watch woot amazon found good price ultra gpscellular order one really love watch love big face longer battery life extra feature state description watch excellent conditionafter arrive wore couple day make sure want felt good wrist like wearing watch order watch face protector bad luck banging watch every hard object get near protector fit great isnt noticeable watch also order heavy duty watch band wouldnt lose hike bike ridesi use monitoring health track sleep exercise routine easy start finish type exercise know many dont know much exercise im actually day keep sit chair long also make fun compete myselfi put watch cellular service work well enjoy access phone many application without bring iphonebased experience definitely recommend refurb watch problem come excellent like new condition also recommend ultra watch face size longer battery low power mode brighter screen waterproof depth ruggedness

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"I was initially hesitant about purchasing a renewed version of the Apple Watch Ultra 2. I wasn’t sure if the “expertly refurbished” label would live up to the standards I expect from Apple products. However, after using it extensively for a week, I’m glad to say that my concerns subsided. Here’s what I’ve liked so far, along with a few areas where there’s room for improvement.Likes:Impressive Performance: Despite being a renewed product, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 performs flawlessly. It's fast, responsive, and handles multitasking like a champ. Whether I’m switching between apps, tracking a workout, or using it for notifications, it’s smooth sailing.Fitness Tracking: This watchOS has completely changed how I track my fitness. The precision of the heart rate monitor, GPS, and various workout modes ensures I’m getting accurate data, which has helped me optimize my training.Health Features: The health tracking features are top-notch. The ECG, and sleep tracking are incredibly insightful, helping me stay on top of my health metrics.Battery Life: I’m pleasantly surprised by the battery life. It easily lasts a couple of days of heavy use, and with lighter use, I can stretch it to almost 2-3 days before needing a charge. Had the Apple Watch series 7 before and it barely lasted a full day.Seamless Integration with Other Devices: As someone who uses multiple Apple products, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 integrates seamlessly with my iPhone, AirPods, and MacBook.Dislikes:Renewed Product Hesitancy: While the renewed version has performed well, there’s still a bit of anxiety in the back of my mind about long-term durability. However, the watch came in excellent condition with no visible wear and tear, so I’m cautiously optimistic.Screen Responsiveness: One major drawback I’ve noticed is that the screen becomes less responsive when my fingers are sweaty during running. This can be frustrating when trying to interact with the watch during a run. I hope this is something that can be improved with software updates, but it’s a noticeable inconvenience.Battery Life: Both a like and a dislike: While the Apple Watch Ultra 2 has more battery life than my recent Apple Watch, it pales in comparison to competitors like Garmin, which can last up to two weeks on a single charge.Overall: I’m incredibly satisfied with my purchase. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (Renewed) has exceeded my expectations, and I’m confident it will continue to serve me well in my fitness, health, and everyday tech needs.

I can’t see a reason for it to last longer or shorter. The days seem comparable in my movement and usage. Coming from a series 7 to an ultra two feels quite different.

Apple Watch Series 7,"So, I decided to get an Apple Watch after my Garmin broke in a restaurant over the holidays. Not to get into it, but their support was horrible and I decided to jump ship.Purchased an 8SE in January and it was great— but I didn’t realize that the SE doesn’t have a keyboard for typing.Returned and purchased this series 7 cellular later in January for about $20-$30 more than the SE was.  It was a certified refurbished purchase and, while it was not eligible for Apple care, it was sold with a comparable 2 year warranty with Amazon.  I was a bit nervous, but it came in perfect condition with a perfect battery.I do have to charge every day, or every 2 days if I remember to turn on low power and other energy-saving modes at night.  I don’t wear in bed.About 10 months in I’m at 94% battery capacity from 100% when I got it.  Do I wish it stayed charged longer?  Sure!  I have to remember to charge it if it’s low and I’m planning on working out, but you just get used to it.Glad I purchased cellular because, even though I didn’t connect it for months, it gave me the option.  I hope to keep the watch long term.Glad I took the chance with return because I’ve had no issues!Series 7 is fantastic and has everything I need (fitness tracking with metrics, general productivity, texts/replies on my watch), and it looks way better than the Garmin as a general watch.  Very easy to swap bands for different occasions or outfits, and there are many options available out there.  I like that I can go from leather band to fabric/silicone easily if I’m getting to work out after work.(As an aside, silver hardware is the better choice generally for Starlight over gold or rose gold if you’d like to match reasonably well)I like to run, do general functional strength training and yoga, and I’ve been happy with Apple for these things.

It has features that I will never use, but still can’t believe that a finally got myself this Apple Watch series 7 and because my wrist is small I got the 41 MM’. It comes packaged in the nice box. It has one extra ban but as all the watches no directions but when paired with your phone, which mine is the iPhone, google has every answer that you might want to receive to tell you exactly how to use your watch,  how to look up things on your watch, and just about everything. I did take it to the AT&T store where they paired it with my cell phone showed me a little bit of how to do it, and I wore it out of the store to a lovely dinner where the waiter noticed in complemented me on as nice watch. I have it on now. It does have a keyboard and it also has surgery that you can dictate to Siri and she can type it out and then send it. I just can’t say enough about this lovely watch. Won’t use all the features but at least I have the watch and ordered the smaller face as I said 41mm. The larger face is the most popular, but my wrist as well so the smaller watch face looks great on my watch arm. I suggest if you were on an Apple Watch don’t wait because you never know what something might happen to you and you would never be able to enjoy such a nice piece of high-tech. Whether I want to use all the features or not which or fitness probably heart weight rate and a bunch more but I’m still learning and after having it for just a few days over a week I find that it holds a charge nicely but I have charged it. You will need an adapter to plug in your wire to the adapter to electric outlet. It charges very quickly and once more it is just beautiful and I absolutely love the watch. Younger people know how to operate all these high tech things want us older people doesn’t, but it doesn’t matter. I love it. I think he will love it and there is nothing wrong with this watch. It is absolutely perfect and it is absolutely beautiful and the star light color and a plus is the two bands. The guy in the store changed one side of the band, but it proved that it didn’t work exactly fit right and we tried to change the band and couldn’t so we looked up on Google how to change the Apple Watch band and there it was on the back of the watch. There was a little button that you push and part of the watch band will just slide down as you slide it then you put the other half of the watch band on that bitch your arm, the best it is easy to put on and I promise you will love this watch .",5.0,Positive,"['absolutely', 'love', 'watch', 'starlight', 'watch', 'top', 'color', 'feature', 'never', 'use', 'still', 'cant', 'believe', 'finally', 'get', 'apple', 'watch', 'series', 'wrist', 'small', 'get', 'mm', 'come', 'package', 'nice', 'box', 'one', 'extra', 'ban', 'watch', 'direction', 'pair', 'phone', 'mine', 'iphone', 'google', 'every', 'answer', 'might', 'want', 'receive', 'tell', 'exactly', 'use', 'watch', 'look', 'thing', 'watch', 'everything', 'take', 'att', 'store', 'pair', 'cell', 'phone', 'show', 'little', 'bit', 'wear', 'store', 'lovely', 'dinner', 'waiter', 'notice', 'complemented', 'nice', 'watch', 'keyboard', 'also', 'surgery', 'dictate', 'siri', 'type', 'send', 'cant', 'say', 'enough', 'lovely', 'watch', 'wont', 'use', 'feature', 'least', 'watch', 'order', 'small', 'face', 'say', 'mm', 'large', 'face', 'popular', 'wrist', 'well', 'small', 'watch', 'face', 'look', 'great', 'watch', 'arm', 'suggest', 'apple', 'watch', 'dont', 'wait', 'never', 'know', 'something', 'might', 'happen', 'would', 'never', 'able', 'enjoy', 'nice', 'piece', 'hightech', 'whether', 'want', 'use', 'feature', 'fitness', 'probably', 'heart', 'weight', 'rate', 'bunch', 'im', 'still', 'learn', 'day', 'week', 'find', 'hold', 'charge', 'nicely', 'charge', 'need', 'adapter', 'plug', 'wire', 'adapter', 'electric', 'outlet', 'charge', 'quickly', 'beautiful', 'absolutely', 'love', 'watch', 'young', 'people', 'know', 'operate', 'high', 'tech', 'thing', 'want', 'u', 'old', 'people', 'doesnt', 'doesnt', 'matter', 'love', 'think', 'love', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'watch', 'absolutely', 'perfect', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'star', 'light', 'color', 'plus', 'two', 'band', 'guy', 'store', 'change', 'one', 'side', 'band', 'prove', 'didnt', 'work', 'exactly', 'fit', 'right', 'tried', 'change', 'band', 'couldnt', 'look', 'google', 'change', 'apple', 'watch', 'band', 'back', 'watch', 'little', 'button', 'push', 'part', 'watch', 'band', 'slide', 'slide', 'put', 'half', 'watch', 'band', 'bitch', 'arm', 'best', 'easy', 'put', 'promise', 'love', 'watch']",absolutely love watch starlight watch top color feature never use still cant believe finally get apple watch series wrist small get mm come package nice box one extra ban watch direction pair phone mine iphone google every answer might want receive tell exactly use watch look thing watch everything take att store pair cell phone show little bit wear store lovely dinner waiter notice complemented nice watch keyboard also surgery dictate siri type send cant say enough lovely watch wont use feature least watch order small face say mm large face popular wrist well small watch face look great watch arm suggest apple watch dont wait never know something might happen would never able enjoy nice piece hightech whether want use feature fitness probably heart weight rate bunch im still learn day week find hold charge nicely charge need adapter plug wire adapter electric outlet charge quickly beautiful absolutely love watch young people know operate high tech thing want u old people doesnt doesnt matter love think love nothing wrong watch absolutely perfect absolutely beautiful star light color plus two band guy store change one side band prove didnt work exactly fit right tried change band couldnt look google change apple watch band back watch little button push part watch band slide slide put half watch band bitch arm best easy put promise love watch
Apple Watch Series 7,"Received it on time. Can be a pain to change straps. Pulse Oximeter is unavailable despite being listed as a feature due to some legal case challenging Apples inclusion of the feature.My device came with less than 90% battery health, which is concerning to say the least. Probably won’t buy from the seller I purchased it from again.Other than these issues it seems to work fairly well so far. I love being able to text from my wrist instead of having to dig out my phone every time. Kinda wish it had more apps but kinda glad it doesn’t since the whole point for me is to lowkey disconnect from my phone/socials.UPDATE:The watch is fine BUT the charger that was included in the order spontaneously self destructed seemingly through overheating randomly four months after I got the watch. It was electrically hot and could have very nearly shocked me on household current when this happened. It was not making contact with anything except a (non conductive) wooden surface at the time this happened.This not only means I’ll have to buy a new charger but it also could have set a fire or sent me to the hospital for electrocution so I’m deducting further stars and the chargers from the reseller should be recalled.",1.0,Negative,"['received', 'time', 'pain', 'change', 'strap', 'pulse', 'oximeter', 'unavailable', 'despite', 'listed', 'feature', 'due', 'legal', 'case', 'challenge', 'apple', 'inclusion', 'featuremy', 'device', 'come', 'less', 'battery', 'health', 'concern', 'say', 'least', 'probably', 'wont', 'buy', 'seller', 'purchase', 'againother', 'issue', 'seem', 'work', 'fairly', 'well', 'far', 'love', 'able', 'text', 'wrist', 'instead', 'dig', 'phone', 'every', 'time', 'kinda', 'wish', 'application', 'kinda', 'glad', 'doesnt', 'since', 'whole', 'point', 'lowkey', 'disconnect', 'phonesocialsupdatethe', 'watch', 'fine', 'charger', 'include', 'order', 'spontaneously', 'self', 'destruct', 'seemingly', 'overheat', 'randomly', 'four', 'month', 'get', 'watch', 'electrically', 'hot', 'could', 'nearly', 'shock', 'household', 'current', 'happen', 'make', 'contact', 'anything', 'except', 'non', 'conductive', 'wooden', 'surface', 'time', 'happenedthis', 'mean', 'ill', 'buy', 'new', 'charger', 'also', 'could', 'set', 'fire', 'sent', 'hospital', 'electrocution', 'im', 'deduct', 'star', 'charger', 'reseller', 'recall']",received time pain change strap pulse oximeter unavailable despite listed feature due legal case challenge apple inclusion featuremy device come less battery health concern say least probably wont buy seller purchase againother issue seem work fairly well far love able text wrist instead dig phone every time kinda wish application kinda glad doesnt since whole point lowkey disconnect phonesocialsupdatethe watch fine charger include order spontaneously self destruct seemingly overheat randomly four month get watch electrically hot could nearly shock household current happen make contact anything except non conductive wooden surface time happenedthis mean ill buy new charger also could set fire sent hospital electrocution im deduct star charger reseller recall

Apple Watch Series 6,"So, I was ready to get my first Apple watch but had a couple of concerns. First, is that I while I wanted a recent model, I didn't want to spend more than two or three hundred bucks. Second, is that many people mention how easy the regular glass scratches. Third, is that the frosted-metal finish on the standard aluminum case is everywhere and no matter what band you get, they stand out as a smartwatch. Nothing wrong with that, just an aesthetic preference.Ok, so the option offered by Apple is to get a watch with one of the higher grade case materials (stainless steel, titanium, ceramic) which they pair with a sapphire crystal front glass. This takes care of both issues. The stainless steel case, when paired with certain bands, totally passes as a regular watch, and the sapphire crystal is far more difficult to scratch (although they are more brittle, so easier to shatter when dropped).The problem is that the upgraded cases cost way more than the aluminum. That's where buying this watch here really shines. It's just one step down from the latest model, has the stainless steel case with sapphire crystal... all for less than half of what a new one would cost with the upgraded case/crystal. Being refurbished I was fully expecting it to have scratches here and there, but would not have minded unless they were on the glass or if the buttons had any issues, or if the battery were too worn. Well, I'm thrilled to say that the watch I received is just about flawless! No scratches I can see, and the battery health is at 90%.  It does come with an aftermarket band and aftermarket charger, but this is to be expected with refurbs, and both were functional and new. A new leather band cost me about ten bucks (notice in the attached picture how the stainless case helps it pass more as a regular watch with the leather band) and a genuine Apple charger was 20 something, and charges the watch a good bit faster than the included one, so I'll just keep the included one in the car for backup. My plan is to mimic the strategy I use on my phones, which is to not let the battery get below 20% and only charge up to about 80% or so. This extends battery health immensely, compared to letting it get too low or always charging to 100%. All in all, I am very happy with this purchase, and wholeheartedly recommend buying one of these refurbs.",5.0,Positive,"['ready', 'get', 'first', 'apple', 'watch', 'couple', 'concern', 'first', 'want', 'recent', 'model', 'didnt', 'want', 'spend', 'two', 'three', 'hundred', 'buck', 'second', 'many', 'people', 'mention', 'easy', 'regular', 'glass', 'scratch', 'third', 'frostedmetal', 'finish', 'standard', 'aluminum', 'case', 'everywhere', 'matter', 'band', 'get', 'stand', 'smartwatch', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'aesthetic', 'preferenceok', 'option', 'offer', 'apple', 'get', 'watch', 'one', 'high', 'grade', 'case', 'material', 'stainless', 'steel', 'titanium', 'ceramic', 'pair', 'sapphire', 'crystal', 'front', 'glass', 'take', 'care', 'issue', 'stainless', 'steel', 'case', 'pair', 'certain', 'band', 'totally', 'pass', 'regular', 'watch', 'sapphire', 'crystal', 'far', 'difficult', 'scratch', 'although', 'brittle', 'easy', 'shatter', 'droppedthe', 'problem', 'upgrade', 'case', 'cost', 'way', 'aluminum', 'thats', 'buy', 'watch', 'really', 'shin', 'one', 'step', 'late', 'model', 'stainless', 'steel', 'case', 'sapphire', 'crystal', 'less', 'half', 'new', 'one', 'would', 'cost', 'upgraded', 'casecrystal', 'refurbish', 'fully', 'expect', 'scratch', 'would', 'mind', 'unless', 'glass', 'button', 'issue', 'battery', 'worn', 'well', 'im', 'thrilled', 'say', 'watch', 'receive', 'flawless', 'scratch', 'see', 'battery', 'health', 'come', 'aftermarket', 'band', 'aftermarket', 'charger', 'expect', 'refurbs', 'functional', 'new', 'new', 'leather', 'band', 'cost', 'ten', 'buck', 'notice', 'attach', 'picture', 'stainless', 'case', 'help', 'pass', 'regular', 'watch', 'leather', 'band', 'genuine', 'apple', 'charger', 'something', 'charge', 'watch', 'good', 'bit', 'faster', 'include', 'one', 'ill', 'keep', 'include', 'one', 'car', 'backup', 'plan', 'mimic', 'strategy', 'use', 'phone', 'let', 'battery', 'get', 'charge', 'extends', 'battery', 'health', 'immensely', 'compare', 'let', 'get', 'low', 'always', 'charge', 'happy', 'purchase', 'wholeheartedly', 'recommend', 'buy', 'one', 'refurbs']",ready get first apple watch couple concern first want recent model didnt want spend two three hundred buck second many people mention easy regular glass scratch third frostedmetal finish standard aluminum case everywhere matter band get stand smartwatch nothing wrong aesthetic preferenceok option offer apple get watch one high grade case material stainless steel titanium ceramic pair sapphire crystal front glass take care issue stainless steel case pair certain band totally pass regular watch sapphire crystal far difficult scratch although brittle easy shatter droppedthe problem upgrade case cost way aluminum thats buy watch really shin one step late model stainless steel case sapphire crystal less half new one would cost upgraded casecrystal refurbish fully expect scratch would mind unless glass button issue battery worn well im thrilled say watch receive flawless scratch see battery health come aftermarket band aftermarket charger expect refurbs functional new new leather band cost ten buck notice attach picture stainless case help pass regular watch leather band genuine apple charger something charge watch good bit faster include one ill keep include one car backup plan mimic strategy use phone let battery get charge extends battery health immensely compare let get low always charge happy purchase wholeheartedly recommend buy one refurbs

Apple Watch Series 6,"For the cost savings, I got the perfect watch.  Is it free from scratches: no.  Can you see the scratches with your arm held out: yes.  Does it honestly really matter... now that's a personal preference.Prior to purchasing, I thought about my previous stainless steel watches (mechanical).  Very quickly after I got each one, they all got scratches in various locations over time.  So even if I were to plunk down the cash for a new Apple stainless one, it was going to get scratched eventually.  Expectations tempered.Also prior to purchasing, I came up with non-negotiables.  Mainly, if the front crystal was scratched, the back sensors had any scratches, the crown was messed up in any way (difficult to turn, cracked, etc), or if the battery felt it wasn't holding a charge.  It was going to go back if any of those were true.When they dipped to a reasonable price, I bought one.  The one I got (sold by CameraGuyz), has some scratches for sure, mainly on the speaker side of the case, as you can see in the photos, as well as various other places on the case (I did get some stainless polish/repair.  I tried barkeepers friend first, which did help a bit, and between the two, really livened it up).  Battery was good (91%), and the front and back and crown/button were pristine.  Lastly, I called my cell provider and verified that the watch could be hooked up to my plan (had them verify the IMEI wasn't blocked or locked).  Check, check, check!Two weeks in, and still going strong.  I love the look of the stainless, and again, for the money paid, truly an incredible deal.  Highly recommend buying this way.

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"I really wanted to write a good review as the watch itself was as advertised and priced reasonably. Unfortunately that's where it ended. The photo and description on the item I ordered clearly stated that it had the ""Titanium Milanese Band"" and ""USB-C"" charger. Neither was true and I tried to work with them to resolve this issue and they refused, falsely claiming that they were not using false advertising and that Apple requires they use this fake band. The band provided was a cheap Chinese steel knockoff of the magnetic style Milanese Loop used on the standard Apple watch series which doesn't suit this watch, not the Ultra Parachute Style real Titanium band one would expect and was shown in their photo (see image). Also, the USB charger is USB-A (not C) so I have to use an adapter. They did offer to refund the watch, but I needed it for a trip and decided to keep it.

Apple Watch Series 8,"As the saying goes, only time will tell, but for now, on day 3, I can share that the Apple Watch Series 8, 41mm GPS + Cellular, ""Excellent Condition,"" arrived, as advertised. There are several sellers under this listing, my order was fulfilled by Woot & shipped by Prime, for reference. At startup, it had 95% battery remaining, and no visible specs or scratches to either the case or crystal. All prior data/user information was wiped & the device was unlocked. The watch surface was completely clean, even free of fingerprints! Keeping in mind that even though stainless models have a more resilient surface and scratch resistance together with a premium sapphire crystal, it could have shown some signs of wear, but didn't! Also enclosed was a startup pamphlet and USB-A charging pad.Sadly, the Pulse Ox function isn't working though it might have, because the watch was delivered with watchOS v11. That’s to be expected with the copyright case still in litigation. I noticed another reviewer said their watch's Pulse Ox works, but it might depend on OS version or region since the lawsuit involves US models. After the initial deep charge, battery capacity dropped 1%, which is what I'll consider as its starting point.I can say with honesty it looks amazing, and as far as durability, it should be a winner given its now 94% battery capacity. I expected some minor cosmetic flaws, and other than the average plastic band and underwhelming generic charging pad, I’m thrilled by it arriving is such pristine condition. I am going to purchase an Asurion plan of coverage.How I charged it & ease of operation:In saying all of that, it required several online searches to get accurate information beyond the included startup guide and Apple's instructions to learn how to setup the watch. Yes, it was tedious and nerve-racking. No fault of Apple's, their documentation is complete, but bringing a fully drained battery up to operation is beyond the User Manual's scope. As it turned out, the issue was that the battery was indeed completely drained. From what I know now, it entered a state that required a 2-1/2 hour deep-charge. The face showed a massive red thunderbolt and no sign of active charging, alternating with the more encouraging charging cable icon. When the watch connected to MagSafe charging pad it didn't show any sign of active charging. I checked Apple Watch subReddit for guidance & one thread said to be patient while allowing it to charge for about 2-3 hours. Apple's site had additional, step-by-step guidelines that were also helpful, but Reddit's information is what gave me hope because Apple's 30 minute charging recommendation (when the red thunderbolt showed) turned out to be too little time for that sort of battery recovery.If you buy one of these watches, what I would recommend is to read the Apple Watch User Guide in advance, because what information arrived with the watch on the brief, 3-step pamphlet (from Kissa Electronics) doesn't represent the entire process or possibility that the battery might be completely drained. The online Apple Watch User Guide suggested trying different chargers, cleaning the charger & watch back, and other tips, but I wasn't prepared for that sort of experience. Since I couldn't verify if the supplied charger was operational, and thinking of one of Apple’s suggestions, I felt more comfortable using my Nubeno 3-in-1 Folding Charging Station's 3W MagSafe pad over the generic MagSafe that was packed in with the watch because I've been using it for several months for my iPhone 16 Pro & AirPods Pro 2's and knew it was functional.After the deep charge, I was pleasantly surprised to see the red thunderbolt icon had vanished and in its place, the Series 8 watch face. All that was left was an OS update, pairing & cellular setup!! YAY. From that point on, my phone & watch took over the procedure and I was able to complete the setup by registering the watch with my cellular carrier. Pairing & activating cellular was flawless.At $222, from the original list price of $699, I think this offer is a wonderful cost-saving option if you aren't wanting a lighter weight aluminum model or newer series.  I am very pleased with the purchase, and though it's too soon to know, it seems like the watch is a fantastic find.",5.0,Positive,"['say', 'go', 'time', 'tell', 'day', 'share', 'apple', 'watch',

Apple Watch Se,"This is hands down one of the greatest tools in my disposal. I didn't understand the hype behind Apple Watches until I recently got my hands on one. I was not sure what to expect so I went with the smaller 40mm watch.  I can say the hype is real. I originally bought this to track my fitness progress as it is something that I have never done before. This has me addicted to the gym and completing monthly challenges. This is also great when going off the grid such as camping, going off road or hiking. I find myself using the built in compass constantly to prevent getting lost in the wild.The only downside of this watch is the battery life. I would like to track my sleeping pattern; however, this rarely happens as after a day of using it the battery dies. That being said the charging is relatively fast, charging a full battery in about an hour and a half.In conclusion, this is a great product that is well worth the hype around it.

Apple Watch Se,"I like what the watch does, but the battery life is garbage. I charge it every night now to make sure it’s good for the entire next day. That means I don’t get to use the sleep tracker, which is frustrating. Other device manufacturers have figured out how to make better batteries. Garmin even has a solar-charging watch.That said, it has lasted longer than any of my (original company) Fitbits both in hardware and connectivity.

Apple Watch Series 8,"This isn't a long term review, but if anything changes I'll update it.  As of now the watch is amazing.  I see after one person mentioned presentation, that improved greatly with mine lol.  Packaging aside, everything is working great, battery life is 100%.  The entire watch looks and feels brand new from the apple store.  The first day had me seriously concerned about the battery lasting though, but apparently the watch was just doing a lot of downloading and setting up in the background which was decreasing the battery by at least 20% per hour which I thought seemed nuts.  After changing some settings and getting things set up efficiently plus the set up process finalizing, everything is perfect.  Under normal circumstances it's been on for over an hour now with a few text alerts coming through etc. and battery is still 100%.  At this rate it should last a solid amount of time.  The apps on this are really cool.  The health stuff like heart monitoring and blood oxygen levels are awesome to have.  The workout apps are set up pretty nice as well.  It would be nice if there were a better way to do updates and whatnot though than doing it via your iphones bluetooth.  Like youtube reviews etc. mention it's sooooo slow.  I thought something was wrong with the watch at first.  Set up and downloading watchOS 10 take a solid 3-4 hours.  The install is beyond slow doing it via bluetooth.  Going through this thing with a fine tooth comb and getting every single app optimized for battery efficiency etc. took a good 12 plus hours and a ton of youtube videos all mentioning different little tips and tricks.  Lots of troubleshooting occurred too.  The complications on the watches face screen weren't functioning right which required to reset the location and privacy data in the phone plus a couple other steps.  The watch was doing a lot of weird stuff that was destroying it's battery and wasting storage at rapid speeds.  That's all just apple, nothing to do with it being renewed or the seller etc.  They all run the same software in them regardless.  Just being real about it, the set up process of this watch wasn't pleasant and kinda made me disappointed in the purchase initially but once I got that out of the way it's working incredibly well.  Also this being a cellular version, you need to contact your carrier in advance and register this with them via the IMEI number from the phone's about section.  You'll just get errors when trying to set up cellular prior to that.  All in all though, the watch is great,  and I love the design, especially how easy it is to switch out straps of whatever style or color you want.  Those are much cheaper than I expected them to be as well so I immediately grabbed a handful of different options.  Definitely recommend anyone interested in an apple watch to try this.  It shows up in brand new condition, these only came out less than a year ago so even original parts are still very lightly used with a long life ahead of them.  Even with a few frustrations, it gets two thumbs up from me.",5.0,Positive,"['isnt', 'long', 'term', 'review', 'anything', 'change', 'ill', 'update', 'watch', 'amaze', 'see', 'one', 'person', 'mention', 'presentation', 'improve', 'greatly', 'mine', 'laughing out loud', 'packaging', 'aside', 'everything', 'work', 'great', 'battery', 'life', 'entire', 'watch', 'look', 'feel', 'brand', 'new', 'apple', 'store', 'first', 'day', 'seriously', 'concerned', 'battery', 'last', 'though', 'apparently', 'watch', 'lot', 'download', 'set', 'background', 'decrease', 'battery', 'least', 'per', 'hour', 'thought', 'seem', 'nuts', 'changing', 'setting', 'get', 'thing', 'set', 'efficiently', 'plus', 'set', 'process', 'finalize', 'everything', 'perfect', 'normal', 'circumstance', 'hour', 'text', 'alert', 'come', 'and so on', 'battery', 'still', 'rate', 'last', 'solid', 'amount', 'time', 'application', 'really', 'cool', 'health', 'stuff', 'like', 'heart', 'monitoring', 'blood', 'oxygen', 'level', 'awesome', 'workout', 'application', 'set', 'pretty', 'nice', 'well', 'would', 'nice', 'good', 'way', 'update', 'whatnot', 'though', 'via', 'iphones', 'bluetooth', 'like', 'youtube', 'review', 'and so on', 'mention', 'sooooo', 'slow', 'thought', 'something', 'wrong', 'watch', 'first', 'set', 'download', 'watchos', 'take', 'solid', 'hour', 'install', 'beyond', 'slow', 'via', 'bluetooth', 'go', 'thing', 'fine', 'tooth', 'comb', 'get', 'every', 'single', 'application', 'optimize', 'battery', 'efficiency', 'and so on', 'take', 'good', 'plus', 'hour', 'ton', 'youtube', 'videos', 'mention', 'different', 'little', 'tip', 'trick', 'lot', 'troubleshoot', 'occur', 'complication', 'watch', 'face', 'screen', 'werent', 'function', 'right', 'require', 'reset', 'location', 'privacy', 'data', 'phone', 'plus', 'couple', 'step', 'watch', 'lot', 'weird', 'stuff', 'destroy', 'battery', 'waste', 'storage', 'rapid', 'speed', 'thats', 'apple', 'nothing', 'renew', 'seller', 'and so on', 'run', 'software', 'regardless', 'real', 'set', 'process', 'watch', 'wasnt', 'pleasant', 'kinda', 'make', 'disappointed', 'purchase', 'initially', 'get', 'way', 'work', 'incredibly', 'well', 'also', 'cellular', 'version', 'need', 'contact', 'carrier', 'advance', 'register', 'via', 'imei', 'number', 'phone', 'section', 'youll', 'get', 'error', 'try', 'set', 'cellular', 'prior', 'though', 'watch', 'great', 'love', 'design', 'especially', 'easy', 'switch', 'strap', 'whatever', 'style', 'color', 'want', 'much', 'cheap', 'expect', 'well', 'immediately', 'grab', 'handful', 'different', 'option', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'interested', 'apple', 'watch', 'try', 'show', 'brand', 'new', 'condition', 'come', 'less', 'year', 'ago', 'even', 'original', 'part', 'still', 'lightly', 'use', 'long', 'life', 'ahead', 'even', 'frustration', 'get', 'two', 'thumb']",isnt long term review anything change ill update watch amaze see one person mention presentation improve greatly mine laughing out loud packaging aside everything work great battery life entire watch look feel brand new apple store first day seriously concerned battery last though apparently watch lot download set background decrease battery least per hour thought seem nuts changing setting get thing set efficiently plus set process finalize everything perfect normal circumstance hour text alert come and so on battery still rate last solid amount time application really cool health stuff like heart monitoring blood oxygen level awesome workout application set pretty nice well would nice good way update whatnot though via iphones bluetooth like youtube review and so on mention sooooo slow thought something wrong watch first set download watchos take solid hour install beyond slow via bluetooth go thing fine tooth comb get every single application optimize battery efficiency and so on take good plus hour ton youtube videos mention different little tip trick lot troubleshoot occur complication watch face screen werent function right require reset location privacy data phone plus couple step watch lot weird stuff destroy battery waste storage rapid speed thats apple nothing renew seller and so on run software regardless real set process watch wasnt pleasant kinda make disappointed purchase initially get way work incredibly well also cellular version need contact carrier advance register via imei number phone section youll get error try set cellular prior though watch great love design especially easy switch strap whatever style color want much cheap expect well immediately grab handful different option definitely recommend anyone interested apple watch try show brand new condition come less year ago even original part still lightly use long life ahead even frustration get two thumb

Apple Watch Series 8,"I purchased this Apple Watch refurbished with an “Excellent” quality rating. When it arrived it has some white scratches along the aluminum casing. The screen also had some light scratches but was mostly not noticeable unless you really looked. Not a big deal I decided to look past those issues, even though I paid for an “Excellent” quality refurbished device.Upon turning the watch on I notice it glitched out a lot when I touched the screen. I figured it was cause I wasn’t wearing it and was at a weird angle so my touches weren’t registering right.I let it charge as it was on 3% out of the box and it took 4 hours to charge to 50%. It came with the old generation charger (USB not USB-C)  as well without a box if you’re curious.When it finally charged I put it on and set it up. I immediately noticed the screen was not responsive and when it was it was incredibly glitchy. It would tap characters multiple times or just not respond at all. This is consistent every time I go to use the watch.I reached out to Amazon who referred me to the seller to see if they could offer a replacement. They did not. They refused to assist me guiding me to return the device through Amazon and get my money back.After coordinating with Amazon they agreed a return is the best solution and offered me a promo credit on my next purchase for the inconvenience and the sellers inability to resolve the problem.I also activated this device within my phone plan prior to confirming it was fully functional, but this is not anyone’s fault but my own. I’ll call that a personal loss. Just some advice to anyone purchasing an Apple Watch with intentions to activate it within their plan, test drive the watch a bit first.

However, i was only guaranteed that the health would be 80% or higher. I expected it to be more, but i got what i paid for.

I also like it for health tracking. You might want to know that you have to be at least 300 feet or less away from it in order to receive calls and texts. I took it to the water park and the water lock works wonderfully. No issues with that.  Overall, I'd say its a really great product. At the time of typing this, the series 9 is the newest watch.

Apple Watch Se,"We wanted a watch not a phone. This provides what he needs (ability to message and call and be located) but has the ability to do more later.We can set school time hours for the school year so messages don’t get through - except from parents, but can easily make adjustments to that for things like field day or early release. Downtime hours are set for evening as well. It isn’t an internet browser (yay) but does send and receive gifs. This watch does not have all of the health metrics a # series does but he doesn’t need that. It does steps and heart and workouts etc. it doesn’t track blood O2 or arrhythmias which is fine.As much as I think apple is pretty intuitive as a company for set up- that is less so when setting up a family watch. I googled a lot of things. Including how to get parent messages to break through school time. Not intuitive. And it can’t play music if not linked to its own phone.

Apple Watch Series 9,"In my experience, Apple never fails to deliver a quality product. This is my first ever Apple Watch. I got the series , 9, 41 mm. I bought a new one instead of refurbished because I wanted to have all of the guarantees of a new watch. Amazon offered some great options and prices and I ended up getting mine for about $50 less than if I had bought it from the Apple Store. I called Apple and asked them about buying an Apple Watch from Amazon and they said they support all of the retailers who sell their products, but could not guarantee it if it was refurbished so that was why I decided to go ahead and buy brand new. I’m still learning a lot of the details of the watch, but it is so nice. It mimics my phone perfectly plus add some fun Clock faces and additional features for working out and health benefits. I love the functions and the size is just right. You have options to make it very bright or keep it dim. So far I just charge it in the evening.

Apple Watch Series 10,"Watch is not a big upgrade from a series 7. I had a 45mm series 7, and bought a 42mm series 10. I did this bc the 46mm as the bigger size was massive.

I upgraded to have the sleep apnea detection as I was concerned I was dealing with that. I also went from a GPS only to a cellular model. Just hooked it up so I can’t say how that works. Anyway, I like that it’s thinner-tho with a case, again, you can’t really tell. Nothing to write home about, but good quality as expected from Apple. I bought refurbished, excellent condition and it was new in my opinion. Band, charger original Apple products . Zero flaws, 100% battery health, not a scratch or blemish.

Apple Watch Series 8,"Quick Review:Is the watch south of $300? If yes, add it to the cart. Do you hate it? Return it.Justify Your Purchase:1. Do you have your phone around for the most part?2. Do you usually drive places on your own?3. Is this purchase more for structure vs. leisure/fitness?4. Will you be around a polluted or dusty environment?5. Are you experiencing stress, insomnia, or health complications?6. For woman: Do you care about menstrual, ovulation, and symptom tracking while on your cycle?*If yes to 3 questions with no interest in upgrading soon, purchase.==== Review: Overall 4.5/5 =====I hesitated to buy the watch because it was labeled ""renewed."" Ironically enough, the product did me one better by not turning on. I struggled to contact the Seller because of Amazon and not the business. The watch did not work for the first 2-3 weeks because of the charger, but it's perfect now.Trust me when I say the mic quality is impressive. I'm not flashy, but I believe this purchase is worth it just with the mic ALONE. You'll see me eating ramen for the next month to rock this! The watch makes me feel energized and productive.I find myself using the watch more than my phone. There's not one connection issue or call drop like there is on my actual phone. The box looked a little dinked, yet authentic. I assume the previous owner didn't keep the box in shape. No scratches, the product includes a soft band, and the customer service is prompt and understanding.I can only choose 4 or 5, so I decided on 5 because of the merchandiser.==== End Review: Overall 4.5/5 =====Series 7 v 8:The Series 8 has Bluetooth 5.3, and the Series 7 has Bluetooth 5.0.The 8 has temperature sensors that separate your data from outside factors like weather. If you don't care about Dust protection, Crash detection, Ovulation predictions, or System trackers, go for the Series 7 for all the same features for ~10.Pricing:If you want to save cash, go for the Series 6 to save ~$100. It has all the same features as the Series 7. Its only differences are the 1mm screen and a slightly slower chip that won't be noticeable for another 2-3 years. You will also have the option to add a cellular data plan for $10/month to purchase before prices are closer to the initial 7 or 8 models.Cellular Data Plan v Raw Dawg:The data plan is if you are typically 100m away from your phone. For all my struggle babies, 100m is a little more than half a football field or ~4 times the size of a basketball court. Do people run without their phones? Cellular data is ideal for hiking, amusement/water parks, and running because you can leave your phone locked away.",5.0,Positive,"['quick', 'reviewis', 'watch', 'south', 'yes', 'add', 'cart', 'hate', 'return', 'itjustify', 'purchase', 'phone', 'around', 'part', 'usually', 'drive', 'place', 'purchase', 'structure', 'v', 'leisurefitness', 'around', 'pollute', 'dusty', 'environment', 'experience', 'stress', 'insomnia', 'health', 'complication', 'woman', 'care', 'menstrual', 'ovulation', 'symptom', 'track', 'cycleif', 'yes', 'question', 'interest', 'upgrade', 'soon', 'purchase', 'review', 'overall', 'hesitated', 'buy', 'watch', 'label', 'renew', 'ironically', 'enough', 'product', 'one', 'good', 'turning', 'struggle', 'contact', 'seller', 'amazon', 'business', 'watch', 'work', 'first', 'week', 'charger', 'perfect', 'nowtrust', 'say', 'mic', 'quality', 'impressive', 'im', 'flashy', 'believe', 'purchase', 'worth', 'mic', 'alone', 'youll', 'see', 'eat', 'ramen', 'next', 'month', 'rock', 'watch', 'make', 'feel', 'energized', 'productivei', 'find', 'use', 'watch', 'phone', 'theres', 'one', 'connection', 'issue', 'call', 'drop', 'like', 'actual', 'phone', 'box', 'look', 'little', 'dinked', 'yet', 'authentic', 'assume', 'previous', 'owner', 'didnt', 'keep', 'box', 'shape', 'scratch', 'product', 'include', 'soft', 'band', 'customer', 'service', 'prompt', 'understandingi', 'choose', 'decide', 'merchandiser', 'end', 'review', 'overall', 'series', 'v', 'series', 'bluetooth', 'series', 'bluetooth', 'temperature', 'sensor', 'separate', 'data', 'outside', 'factor', 'like', 'weather', 'dont', 'care', 'dust', 'protection', 'crash', 'detection', 'ovulation', 'prediction', 'system', 'tracker', 'go', 'series', 'feature', 'pricingif', 'want', 'save', 'cash', 'go', 'series', 'save', 'feature', 'series', 'difference', 'mm', 'screen', 'slightly', 'slow', 'chip', 'wont', 'noticeable', 'another', 'year', 'also', 'option', 'add', 'cellular', 'data', 'plan', 'month', 'purchase', 'price', 'closer', 'initial', 'modelscellular', 'data', 'plan', 'v', 'raw', 'dawgthe', 'data', 'plan', 'typically', 'away', 'phone', 'struggle', 'baby', 'little', 'half', 'football', 'field', 'time', 'size', 'basketball', 'court', 'people', 'run', 'without', 'phone', 'cellular', 'data', 'ideal', 'hike', 'amusementwater', 'park', 'run', 'leave', 'phone', 'lock', 'away']",quick reviewis watch south yes add cart hate return itjustify purchase phone around part usually drive place purchase structure v leisurefitness around pollute dusty environment experience stress insomnia health complication woman care menstrual ovulation symptom track cycleif yes question interest upgrade soon purchase review overall hesitated buy watch label renew ironically enough product one good turning struggle contact seller amazon business watch work first week charger perfect nowtrust say mic quality impressive im flashy believe purchase worth mic alone youll see eat ramen next month rock watch make feel energized productivei find use watch phone theres one connection issue call drop like actual phone box look little dinked yet authentic assume previous owner didnt keep box shape scratch product include soft band customer service prompt understandingi choose decide merchandiser end review overall series v series bluetooth series bluetooth temperature sensor separate data outside factor like weather dont care dust protection crash detection ovulation prediction system tracker go series feature pricingif want save cash go series save feature series difference mm screen slightly slow chip wont noticeable another year also option add cellular data plan month purchase price closer initial modelscellular data plan v raw dawgthe data plan typically away phone struggle baby little half football field time size basketball court people run without phone cellular data ideal hike amusementwater park run leave phone lock away

Apple Watch Series 8,"I recently picked up a renewed Apple Watch Series 8 from Amazon, and while it was a bit iffy at first, it’s been working great overall. When I first got it, the initializing process took a bit longer than expected, which might have made it feel a little off. The screen did have some signs of wear, with light scratches visible, but since I use it at work every day, it’s picked up a few more. It’s not a huge issue though, as it still functions perfectly.In terms of durability, this watch holds up well. Despite the light scratches on the screen, it’s proven to be pretty sturdy over time. I’ve worn it every day, and it’s taken a few bumps without any major damage. The build quality is solid, and even with the wear and tear from daily use, it still feels like a premium product.The charging ability is solid too. It charges up fairly quickly, and I’ve never had issues with it not charging properly. As for the battery, it started at 97% health when I received it, and it’s dropped to 93% now. Even with the slight decline, the battery still lasts me through a full day of work, so I haven’t had to worry about it running out.The fitness tracker works great. It accurately tracks my workouts, heart rate, and daily activity, and I really appreciate the health metrics it provides. The Always-On Retina display is bright and clear, so I can easily check my stats or notifications during the day. The sound quality for calls and media is decent too. The speaker is loud enough for calls, and I can easily hear notifications or music when I need to.For a renewed model, the Apple Watch Series 8 has been a solid purchase. If you’re okay with a few signs of wear and the minor drop in battery health, it’s a great deal for the price.

Apple Watch Series 6,"Update:  07/06/22Returned the watch.  The microphone intermittently functioned, the scratches were bothering me, and new watches are only $100 more than this beat up thing.  Yes, $100 isn’t cheap, but overall it was worth the extra cost.  My new Apple Watch 7 has a larger screen and no signs of use.  It’s worth the upgrade, especially when Amazon describes the refurbished watch “like new” when that is clearly not the case.  Calls from the refurbished watch only worked half the time, and the speaker sounded muffled.  Just pony up for a new watch, which are discounted right now for an apple 7, and be happy.  Hope this updates helps you decide.Ok, the watch costs less than new, but that’s about where the good stuff ends.  It did include a usb charger (Samsung brand! 😟) generic charging cable, off-brand white strap, and poorly packaged in a generic white box.  Literally nothing was done to “recondition” the watch.  First thing I had to do was clean off the former user’s grime that coated the watch back (yuck!).  This took some soap, water, and a toothbrush to clean out the little crevices.  Screen and case came with minor scratches overall, with one more annoying, more pronounced screen scratch that really bugs me.  Battery was completely depleted, which is not good for lithium batteries.  C’mon, for the money you could at least clean and charge the thing!  It’s not in terrible shape, but very clearly used.  It certainly was not refurbished in any way that I can tell.  Imagine buying the watch from your mom after she wore it for a year and you get the idea about my watch’s condition.  Not abused, but certainly used.I’m torn.  This was not a great purchase, and I’m left wondering if its worth the $150 less than new price.  Hard to say.  Just don’t believe the product description claiming “appears new” because that is far from the truth.  Set your expectations accordingly if you purchase from the “Camera Guyz”.  They just take the watch, toss it in a nondescript box with whatever knockoff bits they have laying around, and mail it to you.

Normal trouble shooting processes were completed, I.e. power cycle, unpair and re pair the watch, checked the volume was turned up, and made sure it wasn’t on silent mode which none of these revitalized my Apple Watch’s speaker. I went about my day as normal, completing several more power cycles and power cycled my phone in hopes that this situation would “self heal”, no such luck.So now, I’m stuck with a certified refurbished in excellent condition Apple Watch with a speaker that isn’t speaking.

I put off writing a review until I'd had it for long enough to feel it would have shown me any faults other buyers might want to know. I haven't found any.I have several different bands. The mesh ones (as other reviews will tell you) tend to get tiny breaks in the links that catch on things, but the bands are inexpensive, so economically replaceable. All the watch faces are fun to try out and change your mind about. The watch interfaces nicely with your phone, so you don't have to try to read tiny little type on your watch (though you can, if you wish).

Apple Watch Series 9,"i purchased a refurbished 41mm stainless steel series 9 apple watch from Russ Enterprises. I was very happy with the quality of the product once it arrived. the watch's battery health is at 100%, there are no scratches on the screen, and there are a minimal amount of scuffs along the top and bottom sides of the watch itself that I don't notice. i've been wearing the watch for about two weeks and i haven't noticed any problems. if I didn't know this was refurbished, i would think it was brand new.I had initially bought this same product directly from amazon for a slightly cheaper price, but the watch i received was highly scratched and scuffed. i returned that one, bought the same product from Russ Enterprises, and was much more satisfied with the quality of their product. I know that i'm relatively lucky and not all refurbished watches will come as pristine as the one I received, but especially after comparing the products from the two sellers, I would definitely recommend buying specifically from Russ Enterprises.",5.0,Positive,"['purchase', 'refurbished', 'mm', 'stainless', 'steel', 'series', 'apple', 'watch', 'rus', 'enterprises', 'happy', 'quality', 'product', 'arrive', 'watchs', 'battery', 'health', 'scratch', 'screen', 'minimal', 'amount', 'scuff', 'along', 'top', 'bottom', 'side', 'watch', 'dont', 'notice', 'ive', 'wear', 'watch', 'two', 'week', 'havent', 'notice', 'problem', 'didnt', 'know', 'refurbish', 'would', 'think', 'brand', 'newi', 'initially', 'buy', 'product', 'directly', 'amazon', 'slightly', 'cheap', 'price', 'watch', 'receive', 'highly', 'scratch', 'scuffed', 'return', 'one', 'buy', 'product', 'rus', 'enterprise', 'much', 'satisfied', 'quality', 'product', 'know', 'im', 'relatively', 'lucky', 'refurbish', 'watch', 'come', 'pristine', 'one', 'receive', 'especially', 'compare', 'product', 'two', 'seller', 'would', 'definitely', 'recommend', 'buy', 'specifically', 'russ', 'enterprise']",purchase refurbished mm stainless steel series apple watch rus enterprises happy quality product arrive watchs battery health scratch screen minimal amount scuff along top bottom side watch dont notice ive wear watch two week havent notice problem didnt know refurbish would think brand newi initially buy product directly amazon slightly cheap price watch receive highly scratch scuffed return one buy product rus enterprise much satisfied quality product know im relatively lucky refurbish watch come pristine one receive especially compare product two seller would definitely recommend buy specifically russ enterprise

Apple Watch Se,"The Apple Watch SE (2nd Generation) [GPS 40mm] with a Silver Aluminum Case and Storm Blue Sport Band is a popular option in Apple's smartwatch lineup. Here's a brief review focusing on its features and potential limitations:Pros:Design and Aesthetics: The silver aluminum case paired with the storm blue sport band offers a sleek and modern look, appealing to a wide range of users. The design is both stylish and functional.Performance: As a 2nd generation model, it boasts improved performance over its predecessor, with faster and more efficient processing capabilities.Health and Fitness Tracking: The watch excels in health and fitness tracking, offering a variety of features like heart rate monitoring, step counting, and workout tracking, making it ideal for fitness enthusiasts.User Interface and Experience: The watchOS provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface, with easy navigation and access to a wide range of apps and functionalities.Battery Life: It offers a decent battery life for a smartwatch, sufficient for daily use without frequent recharging.Cons:Price: While more affordable than some other models in the Apple Watch series, it still carries a relatively high price tag, which might be a consideration for budget-conscious buyers.Limited Compatibility: Best suited for users already within the Apple ecosystem, as some features might not be fully available or optimized when paired with non-Apple devices.No Always-On Display: Unlike the higher-end models, the SE does not feature an always-on display, which means the screen goes dark when not in use.Health Features: While it has robust health tracking, it lacks some of the advanced health features found in the more expensive Apple Watch models, such as blood oxygen monitoring and ECG.In summary, the Apple Watch SE (2nd Gen) [GPS 40mm] with a Silver Aluminum Case and Storm Blue Sport Band is a stylish and capable smartwatch, offering a balanced mix of features and performance. It's an excellent choice for those who prioritize health and fitness tracking, seamless integration with the Apple ecosystem, and a modern design.

Apple Watch Se,"I've had several fitness and smartwatches over the years, but the Apple Watch SE truly stands out. This watch is incredibly accurate in tracking active calories burned, which has been essential for maintaining my calorie deficit eating plan. The heart rate monitoring, especially during my morning cardio workouts, is spot on. The look and fit of the band are excellent, although there's a bit of a learning curve to fastening it securely, but once it's on, it stays put.One minor drawback is the battery life; it does tend to be quite power-hungry. After watching a few YouTube videos and tweaking some settings, I managed to conserve battery life more effectively. However, you'll still need to charge it daily for about an hour. Despite this, the features and accuracy of the Apple Watch SE make it a worthy investment, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable fitness partner and stylish accessory.",5.0,Positive,"['ive', 'several', 'fitness', 'smartwatches', 'year', 'apple', 'watch', 'se', 'truly', 'stand', 'watch', 'incredibly', 'accurate', 'track', 'active', 'calorie', 'burn', 'essential', 'maintain', 'calorie', 'deficit', 'eat', 'plan', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitoring', 'especially', 'morning', 'cardio', 'workouts', 'spot', 'look', 'fit', 'band', 'excellent', 'although', 'there', 'bite', 'learn', 'curve', 'fasten', 'securely', 'stay', 'putone', 'minor', 'drawback', 'battery', 'life', 'tend', 'quite', 'powerhungry', 'watch', 'youtube', 'video', 'tweak', 'setting', 'manage', 'conserve', 'battery', 'life', 'effectively', 'however', 'youll', 'still', 'need', 'charge', 'daily', 'hour', 'despite', 'feature', 'accuracy', 'apple', 'watch', 'se', 'make', 'worthy', 'investment', 'highly', 'recommend', 'anyone', 'look', 'reliable', 'fitness', 'partner', 'stylish', 'accessory']",ive several fitness smartwatches year apple watch se truly stand watch incredibly accurate track active calorie burn essential maintain calorie deficit eat plan heart rate monitoring especially morning cardio workouts spot look fit band excellent although there bite learn curve fasten securely stay putone minor drawback battery life tend quite powerhungry watch youtube video tweak setting manage conserve battery life effectively however youll still need charge daily hour despite feature accuracy apple watch se make worthy investment highly recommend anyone look reliable fitness partner stylish accessory
Apple Watch Se,"For years I put off getting an Apple watch because I didn't think it would compare to my Garmin watches or be as tough as my G-Shocks.  While some of that is true this is still an item that I found to be worth the purchase.  It is my go to watch at the office because it helps me keep up with meetings, texts, phone calls and what my kids are up to (i.e. location services).  Because of the Apple watch I also find that I am not constantly grabbing my phone as most things I can simply turn my wrist to see and respond to.  The only reason it was not a 5 star for me is you pretty much have to charge it each night.  Not a deal breaker for me as I am not looking to sleep in it anyway but better battery life would be nice.

Apple Watch Series 8,"I bought this watch for my 19-year-old daughter for the medical aspects of this watch and also the crash detection. We always worry about our teens and young adults nowadays and this brings me a little peace of mind. She also has a medical condition.I like that it doesn’t need to be charged every 12 hours like my Series 5 model.  The battery was still at 70 percent by the time I went to bed.Compared to the Fitbit, that thing doesn’t need to be charged but every six days. It’s amazing. However, I noticed that the Versa 4 was causing me to lose calls when I would use my earbuds. I’m often times hands-free and when I go to answer with my earbud it would hang up on them instead.I don’t have that happen on this watch.

Fitbit Versa 4,"My orginal review was correct but after getting things set up the way that I want, it is a great actvity tracker.1. Battery Life is amazing! If you are like me you hate when you are working out and the watch dies not recoding the steps or activities. This watch will last for 7 days2. The app is easy to use- If you are serious about measuring your activity great way to see how you are doing for the last several days, weeks, months...3. It measures what I care about steps and activityThe watch is not for you if you want-1. seeing emails and texts (not a strong feature)2. Trying to use it to answer callsI change my three stars to five stars after using it for awhile. The band and the orginal watch setup was not well designed but you can order a band for $10 and change the watch screen (use google to search how to do it, it is not hard but not obvious).The amazing battery life was what pushed it to 5 stars.Orginal Review-I had a Versa 2 and really liked it. I have very basic usages-steps, activity and as a watch. It did a wonderful job. It died and so I bought the Versa 4. 1. the watch ban is cheap!! the versa 2 was nothing great but this one is awful. (so i will have to buy another one to replace the one that comes with it). 2. the new watch face trys to do too much. KISS should have been there moto Keep it simple stupid. 3 the sync with the app seems to be off.

Fitbit Versa 4,"When I first got this, it would not maintain sync.  I updated the firmware on the watch, tried doing a factory reset twice, uninstalled/reinstalled the fitbit app twice, ensured that the app wasn't allowed to go to sleep when in the background... nothing worked.  It would work for a few minutes, then when I tried to command Alexa, it would say connection lost.  I decided to contact support, and they informed me that my app was outdated.  Come to find out, version 4.04 of the bitbit app is too old, and will not work.  The latest version, 4.06.7 had not been released for my phone yet, as is typical ridiculous play store behavior.  Google... are you listening?  When a developer releases an update, you shall IMMEDIATELY make it available to EVERY device!  I manually downloaded the apk and installed it, and everything has been working great since.  Alexa follows my direct orders immediately, phone calls come through, texts come through, and I can sync with ease.Overall, I suppose this is an improvement over the Versa 2.  Screen is a little bigger, but the notification vibrations don't seem to be as forceful, even when set to strong.This uses google wallet instead of google pay as the Versa 2 did, so my AmEx will not work for contactless payment.Phone call feature is nice, seems to work OK.  I can hear them, they can hear me.  You can only answer calls, you can't make them.  The $50 brand x watch I ordered to replace this one before I got the sync figured out was able to do that.  It could also control my camera and music player, neither of which is possible on the Versa 4.Google maps is nice if you walk in unfamiliar areas.  I'll probably never need it, but it's nice.Battery life seems to be improved over the Versa 2, but mine was 2 years old so I'm sure the battery had gradually decreased it's charge capacity.  I used it for several days, and he battery was still at 55%.Skin temperature sensor will one day be nice when it can sync with a smart thermostat and automatically adjust the temperature as needed.  But for now, it's just a novelty and has no purpose.  Yes, I know my skin is hot.  I woke up in a puddle of sweat.  Yup, I'm freezing, so my skin is cold.o2 saturation is nice if you have any relevant health problems.If you want to take full advantage of the watch, get the free ""Overview"" clock face by Chris Blyth.  It gives you current and average heart rate, battery percentage, fully customizable date format, allows for a larger clock that shows seconds, and you can have weather, and 6 other health stats displayed on the main screen, all at once.  I have steps, distance, calories burned, active zone minutes, floors, and BMI/BMR.  It all fits, and is easy to read.  Vast improvement over the default face, which shows no useful information.  I had th is face on my versa 2, and loved it.  So glad it's available for the 4.Bottom line, it's a good watch.  There are cheaper brand x ones out there, but none of them have NFC payment, and not all of them have Alexa.  And, you get what you pay for.  fit & finish feels cheap, the screens get washed out in the sun, finicky alexa integration and so on.  Best to pony up and get a refined product.  Be sure to update your fitbit app.  Their customer support said the latest version should be released within a week, but I circumvented the beurocracy and downloaded it manually.

Fitbit Charge 6,"I use to have the fitbit 3 se and loved it for 3 years and i tried the samsung 4 for all the bells and whistles but the charge lasted a day which to me is counterproductive. I decided to go back to my fitbit since I also enjoyed the platform more for recording all my data such as food ect. I missed the barcode feature when putting in your meals. I use mine more strictly for steps, 24 heart rate, sleep analysis, contactless payments and tracking all my workouts. I'm not a runner anymore so I haven't used the built in GPS but based on technical reviews I didn't miss out. It's a fairly new concept which needs more software updates to be fully functional and not drain the battery life to oblivion. My fitbit actually lasts me a little over 8 days this is with turning the always on display off, txt message notifications off ( I don't see a need for this since I'm not one to utilize too many short message replies). And having the display brightness set to dim and even in full sun I can still see the display very crisply. The contactless payments uses Google pay which if you are already an android user with a Google pay wallet set up was easy and I like that for security reasons it only is set for 24 hour use after putting in your 4 digit code before having to reinput your code. Now the code input is trivial to me I don't like the setup for it. The water resistance is good I haven't showered with the device but the waterlock works well when I wash my hands multiple times a day being a nurse. I have not tested it swimming for the 50 meter water resistance claim. The workout options have improved with more options and now I'm able keep track of my active zone minutes. The heart rate tracking during exercises is said to be more accurate than the charge 5 based on tech data analysis reviews that I researched before hand. The downside is Spotify was removed and replaces with YouTube music in which you will need a subscription for. The 1.4 inch amoled size is perfect if you aren't a huge fan of having a bulky tracker on your wrist. You also now have the option of syncing your device with other heart rate monitoring equipment/workout machines including peloton but for me isn't useful. It has a haptic side button now that was seen in older models which i prefer. Another great feature is the addition of Google maps for those are are runners but again you may compromise the battery life. Since Google bought fitbit there will be more Google geared software. For more health features you now have the eda and ecd scan no BP monitor like on my samsung 4 to my knowledge has pased fda as of yet. You also have a skin temperature sensor like in the fitbit sense how accurate I'm unsure it would need to be tested against something like a NTC thermistor. The sleep analysis data seems overall accurate. I also do use a cpap machine. Overall for the price I think it's a more than suitable tracking device with its more updated hr monitoring compared to other apple watches, garmins and huawei. Still room for improvement such as the built in GPS. I think the GPS should just be mirrored on your phone which is still an option on the charge 6 you can chose dynamic, built in or phone. I would stick with phone to preserve battery but in all I recommend this product.",5.0,Positive,"['use', 'fitbit', 'se', 'love', 'year', 'try', 'samsung', 'bell', 'whistle', 'charge', 'last', 'day',

Fitbit Charge 6,"I had my old FitBit Charge 4 for 5 years. The band broke off at year 2, so I would put it in a pocket or in a sock while I went about my day....worked great, just easy to lose that way. We were on vacation and it just died. I had really gotten used to having a FitBit to track steps (really all I do). Amazon had the Charge 6 for a good price, and it was almost seamless to set this up. I love the ability to change the clock face. It does track sleep but I'm not sure it's accurate. No matter. It tracks my steps, reminds me to move when I am sitting, notifies me if my phone is ringing when my ringer is off, and (bonus) I can see what time it is on my wrist.

Fitbit Charge 6,"Bought January 2024. So, I have had an Apple Watch since 2017. I LOVED it. But I didn’t love the battery time. The things I was interested in, like sleep tracking, I couldn’t do because it needed to charge or I couldn’t use it the next day. My mom has a Fitbit and for years was telling me to get one. After some health issues, I needed to start being more cognizant of my health. I didn’t want to spend another $5-600 on an Apple Watch that at most gets 2 days of battery now. I was interested in the Oura ring, but I have 60 lbs. to lose and those can’t be sized as you lose weight. So I researched and found the Fitbit Charge 6 was my best choice.Mostly pro’s.It is really comfortable. When I fell asleep accidentally with the Apple Watch my wrist was sore after. So far, I’m getting 6-7 days of charge out of it, which is a game changer. I now don’t miss days of tracking because I forgot to charge it.I feel like the screen size is appropriate and it’s well made. I’m not sure about the accuracy, but reviews I’ve watched where people test them they seem close enough. And that’s good enough for me, I want a baseline.You can adjust the haptics for notifications, I have it on the hardest vibration and it’s awesome. It’s easy to read the screen, just 2 taps. It says you can water lock it for swimming/shower but I haven’t utilized that yet.The app… okay so when I purchased this (January 2024) they offered the premium app for 6 months free, then $80 a year. I will be keeping the premium. It still can be used without, but I want ALL the metrics you can get as well as meditations and workouts. It has replaced MyFitnessPal because I can track everything in this app. It also links with my Bluetooth scale. You can track steps, miles, calories, exercise, activity minutes (150 minutes a week as recommended), standing activity by getting up every hour for 250 steps, (it reminds you). SpO2, HRV, skin temp., HR, sleep (including stages). I’m sure I’m forgetting something. I haven’t used the GPS function which I heard drains the battery significantly.Somewhat cons, or things I would appreciate it having. This device is logged in through Google. I do see messages and notifications from my iPhone 13, but are unable to respond which is fine. You can control YouTube music, but not your Apple Music. It’s Just an adjustment from my Apple Watch. I’m also not able to sync it with Apple Maps because I hate Google maps. And I haven’t figured out how to use that between my phone and the Fitbit yet even after watching tutorials. I wish they had more watch faces to choose from, I think there was about 12?. I just felt like the one I picked was as close to what I wanted, but it wasn’t. The time takes up a large portion of the screen which I feel like is unnecessary. What I feel the app is lacking is something to track when you’ve taken your meds. If they did, this app would literally be a one stop shop for my health/fitness tracking. Note: a comment someone made about med tracking was just set an alarm. The problem is that if you are someone like me that is never at the same place everyday, you could turn the alarm off and then forget later whether or not you took them. It’s a really quick fix they could do.I HIGHLY recommend the Charge 6, I wish I had listened to my mom and got it a while ago. The few things I gave up by switching from my Apple Watch is minor. I’m not missing them other than Apple Maps and Music.",5.0,Positive,"['buy', 'january', 'apple', 'watch', 'since', 'love', 'didnt', 'love', 'battery', 'time', 'thing', 'interested', 'like', 'sleep',

What I really like about this tracker is the smaller size.  When my Charge 5 died (tried to wash it off under the faucet), I looked into the Charge 6.  Reviews were not reassuring.  So this one had more positive reviews and thought I’d give it shot.  So far it’s been great.  Easy to use, display responds well to touch, screen is legible, and it supports just what I need.  Plus, it’s less $$ than the new Charge.  At this point very happy with my purchase.  Recommended. Will follow up with updates as needed.Update 5-10-24. So within three days battery dropped to 19%.  A disappointment given the description states up to 10 days.  So I made a few changes in the watch configuration and fully recharged.  After36hours battery is at 66%.  A week would be acceptable but anything less a disappointment.Update 5-13-24. Turned off always on display.  Battery at 44% after 6 days, not bad.  Happy I bought this tracker over the Charge 6.Update 6-1-24 Ok, I really like this tracker.  Soooo glad I bought it over the Charge 6.  It has yet to disappoint me and Im getting at least 8-9 days from a charge.  Best part is I like the small profile and simplicity of the display.  I see the large display watches and trackers and wonder why anyone would want such a clunky device on their wrist.  Now if you wants apps, fancy displays, emergency calling, and all parameters on one screen, this tracker is not for you.  So glad I made this purchase.1-25-25. So the original Fitbit functionality was great throughout the past 9 months until the hinge point of the strap failed.  The plastic where the pin secures the strap to the watch fractured.  What to do?  I tried some epoxy, worked for a few weeks.  So I just ordered a new watch.  Unfortunately, the watch gave me less than one year of service.  Had it not been for its otherwise excellent performance I would have considered abandoning Fitbit.  But I went and ordered a new one.  Seems the watch is a disposable item with a life expectancy of less than a year.  Too bad, seems few things in life have consistent longevity.  I’ll have to see how long this one keeps me happy.  I’m not going to deduct a star at this point.  We’ll just have to see how this goes.4-11-25  I really like this device.  it has performed well.  I've been reading a few negative reviews.  Seems people expect too much from a small rather inexpensive fitness watch.  This device is great as a tracker but is not without fault.  Keep that in mind and you won't be disappointed.  I think others feel they should get the equivalent of an expensive electrocardiogram or sleep results that you can only get from visiting a sleep center.  Ain't gonna happen.  Just use the device as it is intended, as a tracker.  Overall, once the tracker has accumulated enough data on your habits, it will serve as a reliable reflection of your exercise and health.  I think it is worth it and would buy another.7-10-25  A few more months of use.  No complaints.  Good tracker.  I sync it up with my iPhone and iPad.  Sometimes it goes ok other times I need to pair it again.  But not a major issue as it does catch up with the latest data.  I rely on this compact tracker quite a bit for my steps, distance walked, exercise time, and general sleep quality.  it also seems stop on with my resting heart rate.  I still like it very much and would buy again.",5.0,Positive,"['ive', 'previously', 'charge', 'like', 'good', 'thing', 'come', 'end', 'typical', 'life', 'span', 'little', 'year', 'im', 'ok', 'really',

Fitbit Inspire 3,"I don’t really write reviews super often but I have to this time.First of all, I’ve had this for about a year, and it does what it says it does. It’s a good counter for steps, it monitors my heart rate, it notifies me when I get a text. It’s nothing special but no complaints. If that was the whole story, I wouldn’t be writing this.Background, I’m exceedingly forgetful. I lose stuff all the time and I’ve lost this bad boy many times but I always find him. I lost him recently but just couldn’t find him. Until this morning. When I found him dangling in the dryer that had been running for 2 hours on high. After going through the washer on heavy the night before.I grabbed him and realized that this time I had really messed up, he was more than lost this time, he was lost to the world. But for you know whats and giggles, I plugged him into the charger.He works. He looks completely normal. Nothing is off.In a time when technology is so fragile, when we are constantly fighting planned obsolescence, this little Fitbit is a reminder that sometimes technology can go above and beyond what is expected.

Fitbit Sense 2,"I’ve had the Fitbit Sense 2 for a couple months now, and I’ve been really impressed with what it offers. I’ve tried a few smartwatches over the years, but this one stands out because it actually helps me stay on top of my health without being overwhelming.What’s working well:Stress tracking: The built-in sensor that tracks stress throughout the day has been more useful than I expected. It lets me know when I’m a bit too tense and reminds me to take a breather.Sleep tracking: Super detailed and pretty accurate. It’s not just telling me how long I slept, it’s breaking it down into stages and helping me figure out why some nights feel more restful than others.Health features: Between heart rate, skin temperature, and blood oxygen tracking, I feel like I’ve got a better grip on how I’m doing overall. It’s not medical-grade, of course, but it’s enough to be helpful.Battery life: I easily get 5–6 days per charge, which is great since I wear it overnight for sleep tracking.Comfort and design: It looks good and wears comfortably. Lightweight and low-profile, which I appreciate.Things to keep in mind:It’s not a full-blown smartwatch with tons of apps or customization options. It’s built for health tracking, and it stays in that lane.You can’t type out full text messages on it, just use quick replies or voice-to-text. That hasn’t been an issue for me, but it’s worth knowing.If you're looking for a smartwatch that focuses on wellness and helps you build better habits, this is a great pick. It doesn’t try to do everything, but what it does, it does really well.

Fitbit Sense 2,"I purchased this watch primarily for its continuous heart monitoring, ECG app, sleep monitoring, plus some basic fitness like steps and stairs.It was easy to install. I was pleased to be able to turn off the GPS and Alexa which may have been good for an extra day of battery life. I was able to turn off the fitness nags. I've been running and working out over 40 years and don't need nags. I was also able to skip the Premium service since I don't want a monthly bill and don't want other nagging.There are a huge number of watch faces available. I focused only on free watch faces. One thing that wasn't clear is that apparently you can only install 6 faces on the  watch. When I found a better choice, it wouldn't install and had no useful explanation of why not. I ended up looking specifically for watch faces that included a battery indicator (surprisingly not universal!) and basic fitness figures. The hard part was finding watch faces that increased the font size of the battery % and fitness figures so they were more easily legible to older eyes.The biggest problem is with the watch band. I have a narrow wrist and bands with holes like the OEM band are never spaced in a way that fits well. So I ordered a new band that is metal mesh and uses a clamp to fix the length. That works to get a comfortable fit, but is a pain to put on. Good thing I only take the watch off once a day! So I tried another watch band that had a folding clasp, like my old watch band, and is adjusted in length by removing links. The whole process of removing links was a serious pain, requiring a magnifying ring light and great patience. And the link removal did not yield a snug and comfortable fit, just as with the OEM watch band. Back to the band that works, for now.Update. I just discovered it is possible, apparently, to get an adapter from my old watch band that attaches to the watch with pins to the FitBit clamp system. I'm hoping that will allow me to use my old watch band which was excellent.Further update:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN1RVM5W?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsThis adapter took a long time to arrive all the way from China, but it worked perfectly. My old watch band was a 20mm band with adjustable sizing clamp and a folding clasp to take it on and off:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CY5D2LB/ref=pe_2313400_740551120_em_1p_0_lm?th=1Now I have the best of all worlds. A good watch and it is easy to put on and take off with a snug fit.

Fitbit Sense 2,"Amazing. One of my favorite purchases I made in a while.The app is incredible, I have a pixel 9 pro and the Fitbit app was already installed.

Fitbit Google Ace Lte,"Finally, after failing twice with Gizmo watches for my older kids, we found success with this watch for my 3rd child. It is simply the best kid's smartwatch we've owned BY FAR.Pro's: This watch looks great, performs above expectations and my daughter loves it.1. The sound quality is more than adequate on the other callers end. It's not perfect on the Fitbit end but it's very close when it comes to clarity.2. The fact that my daughter has to meet certain fitness goals (steps) in order to unlock any game features is such a great idea. She will go out of her way to meet the step goal every day and every month just so she can be earn new games. It's so cool.3. School mode allows the parents to put the watch in a Do Not Disturb mode during school hours in order to keep them from being distracted but still allowing them to accumulate steps4. It looks great5. The touchscreen is responsive and simple to use6. The texting is easy and convenient. Allowing her to talk to text and also send vocal recordings is awesome.7. The tracking feature is very accurateCons:1. The battery drains pretty quickly. It is of course, affected by how much she uses it, but on average it only lasts around 24 hours. Either way, we bought a charger stand made specially for the device and she easily charges it while she sleeps.2. I wish we could just simply press once to toggle school mode. Instead you have to go into settings and find it. It won't allow a single call or text go through in this mode. I bet you're thinking ""That's what it's supposed to do."" You're right, but in an actual emergency while in school mode, she would have no way to reach us and vice versa. I wish there was a simple way to toggle it on both ends. For example, the other day my oldest son dropped my daughter off at her friend's house the other day. Unfortunately, the friends weren't home but my son had already left her there. She's 9, so she freaked out when she realized she was alone. This happened on a snow day so school was cancelled. The watch would not allow my daughter to call us for help. Even though there was no school, the watch was still is school mode. (After crying a while, she's doing great now btw).All of that said, this is well worth the cost!",5.0,Positive,"['finally', 'fail', 'twice', 'gizmo', 'watch', 'old', 'kid', 'find', 'success', 'watch', 'rd', 'child', 'simply', 'best', 'kid', 'smartwatch', 'weve', 'own', 'farpros', 'watch', 'look', 'great', 'performs', 'expectation', 'daughter', 'love', 'sound', 'quality', 'adequate', 'caller', 'end', 'perfect', 'fitbit', 'end', 'close', 'come', 'clarity', 'fact', 'daughter', 'meet', 'certain', 'fitness', 'goal', 'step', 'order', 'unlock', 'game', 'feature', 'great', 'idea', 'go', 'way', 'meet', 'step', 'goal', 'every', 'day', 'every', 'month', 'earn', 'new', 'game', 'cool', 'school', 'mode', 'allow', 'parent', 'put', 'watch', 'disturb', 'mode', 'school', 'hour', 'order', 'keep', 'distract', 'still', 'allow', 'accumulate', 'step', 'look', 'great', 'touchscreen', 'responsive', 'simple', 'use', 'texting', 'easy', 'convenient', 'allow', 'talk', 'text', 'also', 'send', 'vocal', 'recording', 'awesome', 'track', 'feature', 'accuratecons', 'battery', 'drain', 'pretty', 'quickly', 'course', 'affect', 'much', 'us', 'average', 'last', 'around', 'hour', 'either', 'way', 'buy', 'charger', 'stand', 'make', 'specially', 'device', 'easily', 'charge', 'sleep', 'wish', 'could', 'simply', 'press', 'toggle', 'school', 'mode', 'instead', 'go', 'setting', 'find', 'wont', 'allow', 'single', 'call', 'text', 'go', 'mode', 'bet', 'youre', 'think', 'thats', 'suppose', 'youre', 'right', 'actual', 'emergency', 'school', 'mode', 'would', 'way', 'reach', 'u', 'vice', 'versa', 'wish', 'simple', 'way', 'toggle', 'end', 'example', 'day', 'old', 'son', 'drop', 'daughter', 'friend', 'house', 'day', 'unfortunately', 'friends', 'werent', 'home', 'son', 'already', 'leave', 'shes', 'freak', 'realize', 'alone', 'happen', 'snow', 'day', 'school', 'cancel', 'watch', 'would', 'allow', 'daughter', 'call', 'u', 'help', 'even', 'though', 'school', 'watch', 'still', 'school', 'mode', 'cry', 'shes', 'great', 'btwall', 'say', 'well', 'worth', 'cost']",finally fail twice gizmo watch old kid find success watch rd child simply best kid smartwatch weve own farpros watch look great performs expectation daughter love sound quality adequate caller end perfect fitbit end close come clarity fact daughter meet certain fitness goal step order unlock game feature great idea go way meet step goal every day every month earn new game cool school mode allow parent put watch disturb mode school hour order keep distract still allow accumulate step look great touchscreen responsive simple use texting easy convenient allow talk text also send vocal recording awesome track feature accuratecons battery drain pretty quickly course affect much us average last around hour either way buy charger stand make specially device easily charge sleep wish could simply press toggle school mode instead go setting find wont allow single call text go mode bet youre think thats suppose youre right actual emergency school mode would way reach u vice versa wish simple way toggle end example day old son drop daughter friend house day unfortunately friends werent home son already leave shes freak realize alone happen snow day school cancel watch would allow daughter call u help even though school watch still school mode cry shes great btwall say well worth cost
Fitbit Google Ace Lte,"Prepare for your child to send you a boat load of poop emojis, haha.Pros- Very fun fast UI with lots to do and explore, encouraging kids to move in fun ways- Bright clear screen- Games require children to first move and be active before playing or the game is active itself- GPS location works very fast. Somehow even faster than Find My for iPhones (works off WiFi).- Text messages, calls and voice messages are quick and responsive (works off WiFi).- Dedicated ACE parental app works very well on iPhone, with good parental controls- Peace of mind of a “closed” ecosystem. My kids can’t message anyone.Neutral- Data plan is independent of any carrier.- Battery life of meh, but it charges very fast. It’ll get though about a day depending on screen brightness and use.Cons- Fitbits historical reputation for reliability and support is very sub-par with some of their devices. Time will tell. This device is well made and operates smoothly so far.Games- Fitness challenges- Scout the fitness coach- Decorate a house with items purchased by movement/activity- Golf and other mini gamesAs a parent I wanted to be able to keep on touch with my kids as they go to friend’s houses, field trips, etc. I also want them to feel that I’m still accessible when they’re away somewhere. My kids are 10 and 7. I feel age 6-13 is the perfect age range for a device like this.This watch costs a good amount more than a Gizmo or other watches. The cost is similar to an Apple Watch SE. But this Fitbit is a purpose-made device for kids unlike the Apple Watch. The Fitbit encourages movement and play. It’s genuinely fun UI is more appealing to kids than the utilitarian Apple Watch UI. In my opinion the Fitbit is also safer to use, limiting their ability to communicate with anyone except myself, my wife, and their siblings.I sincerely hope Fitbit follows the fun gamification philosophy for adult Fitbits as well.

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,This thing is just not great for how expensive it is. The battery life is TERRIBLE. I basically had to turn off all of the smart watch features to keep the battery from needing to be charged every day. Defeats the purpose of a smart watch. The sleep tracker never detects sleep accurately. After 8h of sleep it pops up that I only slept 45 minutes. I'm pretty sure I would feel horrible if I had only gotten 45 minutes of sleep. The 02 sensor works sometimes and then other times it doesn't. Just overall a real piece of garbage for being so expensive. I'm going to return it and get a Garmin.

Fitbit Inspire 3,"I really love this watch. It has a slim profile and a nice little touch screen. It tells the time. I can see my phone's notifications easily so I don't have to pull out my phone each time. I like the heart rate tracking function. I don't use most of the other activity functions but it has a pretty good step counter too. It has a find phone function that works well as long as you are within Bluetooth range. I've needed that a couple times so far. I'm not crazy about the stop watch feature because you can't start it then go back to the other menus, like looking at the time, without stopping the stop watch. If you can, I haven't figured it out. Battery life is good, I usually charge it once a week or so. It's been completely water resistant when I shower and even had a water lock you can turn on so the water droplets don't trigger touch input. It seems durable enough for regular wear and use, but I wouldn't test crushing it on purpose. App pairing was pretty easy the first time but when I got a new phone I had a little trouble unpairing and repairing to the new phone, I ended up factory resetting it but it isn't really a problem because all your info is stored in the app and cloud. Sleep tracking seems pretty accurate. I do wish I could customize the features a little more, like it does activity tracking with ""zone minutes"" but I really don't care about that, but it still shows up as I tap through the metrics on the watch home screen. Same with calorie burning. Not sure how accurate the calorie burning tracker is.All in all it's a great watch.

Fitbit Inspire 3,"I mainly bought this fitbit to monitor my nightly sleep quality, although the overall health monitoring is a plus. 4 sleep stages are monitored: Deep, Light, REM, and Awake. Since it's all monitored at the wrist, the accuracy is unknown; however, the desired 10-20% of deep sleep (of the total) appears to be attained. Also, patterns can be seen, such as decreasing deep sleep if caffeine has been ingested. For O2, it only measures average variance; I wish it would give absolute reading over time like an SPO2 monitor that can be shown on a time chart. Also, the data can be downloaded to local computer, but it is tedious to use for a charting app, and is separated into various folders. It appears that only the fitbit app can use the data easily. It also monitors steps automatically, and exercise (start/stop manually). Other things are monitored, like cardio load, daily exercise, active zone, burned energy, etc. Weight can be input automatically with another app sync.

Fitbit Versa 2,"I've had various Fitbit products over the years, and have really liked them, and Fitbit customer service has been great to me.  This is an upgrade from my Charge 2.  The other watch I considered was the Apple 4 (or now 5), but it's twice the price at $399.  The Apple had a EKG (really ECG) that I liked, but was not sure it would be too helpful for me.  And the Fitbit has sleep tracking a feature that the Apple Watch does not come with.  And the battery life on the Fitbit Versa 2 is a lot better with 4-5 days vs. Apple's less than one day (18 hours).The screen is beautiful, a HUGE upgrade.  Lots of clock choices.  There is an always on screen, but I chose to keep it off for now, it uses more power, and it's a very basic black and white, simple screen.  And not sure I always want the screen on, there are times like in a theater or in a dark room where it would be distracting.  A big plus is you can turn auto screen off at night, so it does not come one when you move in your sleep.  A very useful feature, that should save some battery life too.I needed to call customer service as I was having problems getting it added on my Fitbit app.  Since the watch is brand new (released September 15), it needs the latest Fitbit app for it to work.  After that was fixed, there was a bluetooth issue, but after turning it off and on, we were in business.A wonderful upgrade for me.EDIT:  I want to add, the watch bands are so much better than previous one's I've used on Fitbit watches.  I'm guessing they are no different than those on the previous Versa, but they are so much easier to use than those on the Charge 2.

Fitbit Versa 2,"Love the watch.  The size is perfect.  The screen/resolution is crystal clear.  The selection of bands is great (though changing bands is a bit challenging).  The fabric band that comes with the Special Edition version is great.  Classes it up a fit.  Have also ordered a sport band to wear while playing soccer, swimming, etc.  The device includes nearly all desired features needed for a fitness/smart watch.  It does not have built-in GPS but rather uses connected GPS.  Some may see this as a deal breaker; others will recognize the battery savings that this affords.  And so far, the watch performance has been excellent.There are some reviews that describe Versa failure after getting it wet.  I have successfully showered with the watch with no problem.  I have not yet had a chance to try it in the pool.  Based on the specs it should be fine, but time will tell.  The Versa is not recommended to be worn in hot tubs.As Fitbit has long been a leader in activity tracking, I won’t spend time on those features.  Compared to the Samsung watch that I’ve worn … step counting, heart rate info, calories and sleep tracking all seem to be in line with my historical measurements.  A big benefit is that the Fitbit app is much more robust then the Samsung health app with significantly more data to analyze.The watch software and the battery consumption on both watch and linked phone need some attention.  I’m still trying to determine the optimal settings to achieve a balance of desired performance versus battery life.  With current settings, I can average about 3 days before needing to charge give or take a half day depending on usage.  I’m currently using the always on display which is nice.  It does consume some battery, but so far has not been too heavy of a drain to make the feature unusable.If you choose to use the music app to control music playing on the phone, then expect a massive battery hit.  This functionality requires linking an additional bluetooth connection called Fitbit classic.  It’s my experience that this connection continuously drains the battery on both the watch and the phone -- as much as 20% while sleeping.  That is with the watch in sleep mode and the phone on do not disturb.  I have removed this connection and will control music the old-fashioned way.  Note that this applies ONLY to playing music on the phone and not to connecting to bluetooth earphones.Another setting offered in the Fitbit app is “All-Day Sync.”  This feature constantly updates the data -- activity, heart rate, etc. -- from the watch to the phone.  Sounds good, but it also is a battery hog and I have it disabled.  As far as I know, syncing can be done one of two ways -- either via the all-day setting or manually when you open the app.  I’m currently choosing to update manually.  The developers need to add an option so the devices can be set to sync on a user-defined interval -- hourly, every six hours, daily, etc.  A setting like this exists for nearly every other phone app that requires data to be synced.  Weather apps are the first that come to mind.I am a Samsung user -- Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Buds (wireless earphones).  I can tell you that the Galaxy Buds will not work with the Versa 2 watch (as of 11/26/2019).  The Buds will link, but they will not play audio.  Something to do with different types of bluetooth used in the devices.  The issue is discussed in several online forums, but no word from Fitbit or Samsung if it will ever be addressed or fixed.  The watch does pair to the S10 without issue and works perfectly well.  All notifications are received timely and the bluetooth connection is much better/stronger than with my previous Samsung watch.  It easily stays connected at 30-40 feet.There are a couple of issues that need to be addressed related to phone notifications on the watch.  First, Gmail is the only client that is available as the ""default"" mail application.  Or, at least it is in my Fitbit app.  I can select to be notified by other email apps from my phone, but Gmail is the only app that can be set to receive ""special"" notification treatment according to the Fitbit app.  Secondly, alarms on the phone (and I use quite a few) are NOT available to notify on the Versa.  This feature would be a big plus to me.  You can set 8 alarms on the Versa.  However, each alarm uses some battery, and I would simply be duplicating alarms on multiple devices.  For example, I would not remove an alarm from my phone as I may need it while the watch is charging or not being worn.To correct other reviews that I've seen, music CAN be uploaded and stored on the watch.  The process requires using the desktop app and is a bit slow, but it works.  IF I had wireless headphones that connected properly, then I could play music direct from the Versa without the phone.One other small issue is that weather info does not exist on the clock face by default.  Third party clock faces can be installed, but I’ve found that they often require a separate setting for weather updates, which then only work if the All-Day Sync option is enabled.  I’m continuing to search for alternatives to see what options exist.There are quite a few apps available for download and use on the watch.  I haven't found any to be all that relevant or helpful to me.  At least not yet.  But the platform and functionality are there to use if desired.Also, I need to mention that the Alexa integration is great.  We have a heavy investment in Echo devices in our household, so to have the same functionality on my wrist is a great bonus.If, like me, you are apple averse, then this is one of the best smart watches available that I have found.  And very affordable.  At this point, I would rate it 8 out of 10.  And I would certainly increase that rating with continued additions to and improvement in the software, connectivity and watch features.**UPDATE 12/9/2019**Fitbit released a firmware update a few days ago which added some great features.  The Versa now saves your 5 most recently used clock faces and you can change them on the fly without having to go to the app.  Though there are tons of clock faces to choose from, one of the drawbacks with Fitbit is that you cannot flag, save or otherwise have access to your favorite faces.  You have to keep a manual list of the names or just remember so that you can find them again.  There needs to be a way to store a list of favorite faces and apps so that you can access and install them quickly.Other updates include that you can now customize the action of the side button, the sleep score is displayed on the watch, the list of exercises to choose from has expanded, and by reports the heart rate data has been improved.So I've learned that one of the tricks to manage battery life and connectivity is to restart the watch after making certain changes, such as switching to a new clock face.  You may notice that the Versa stops sending notifications or is not syncing to the app.  I've found that after a quick restart, the watch works perfectly again.  Maybe it's a software glitch, but at least there is an easy workaround.  And if you leave the watch alone, then these issues should not occur.For full functionality of the watch, including some features of many clock faces, I have re-enabled the All-Day Sync setting.  The watch and app perform much better with the setting enabled.  And unless I receive a ton of notifications or am constantly playing with the settings, I am now getting 4 to 5 days of battery life which is great.  This could also very well have something to do with the recent software update.  I am not currently using the always on display.  I estimate that AOD cuts the battery life by 30 to 50 percent.Also, before you make a decision with the help of reading these spectacular reviews, you might gauge the quality of the reviews.  This watch is by no means perfect and may not be the best choice for you, but you should decide that for yourself.  Then return it if you're not satisfied.  This is an electronic device and there can be duds.  Some buyers have expressed frustration after receiving a device that was dead on arrival.  Completely understandable.But there are many 1-star reviews that are not from a literate source.  A two word review that reads ""hate it"" is not helpful.  One review reads only ""no fitbit pay"" which is completely untrue.  The Versa absolutely has Fitbit Pay.  Also, I'm intrigued that apple phone users don't just pair their phone with an apple watch.  Not sure why they are shocked that the Versa does not work as seamlessly for them as a product designed by their phone maker.  Bottom line ... be your own judge.As referenced in my original review, I have updated my rating of the Versa 2 to a 9 out of 10, based on performance and recent software updates.  Hopefully my positive experience will continue.",5.0,Positive,"['love', 'watch', 'size', 'perfect', 'screenresolution', 'crystal', 'clear', 'selection', 'band', 'great', 'though', 'change', 'band',

Fitbit Versa 2,"I use this in my every day life now that I own it, it helps me manage my phone calls and texts really well.As for the fitness aspect of it, it's decent, but lacking in a lot of aspects as well. The step tracking is nearly completely inaccurate: turning in my sleep after midnight counts steps for the next day, I can wake up with up to 200 steps already taken, and trust me, that's not sleepwalking. Not only that, but when I go through a particularly intense car ride (my coworker... loves to hit well over the speed limit sometimes. And in alaska, you get ice heaves in the road, which can make for a VERY bumpy ride.) I end up with my daily stairs count going up.The sleep tracking could be better, it's based on heart rate so you have to really go under for it to start tracking, which might mean a few minutes of sleep are shaved off as you get to homeostasis.The battery is exactly as advertised so far, it lasts about 3-4 days before I recharge it, and could probably go at least a little bit longer than that depending on use.My main complaint is Alexa: she's totally useless trapped in this tiny little watch. ""Set a timer for 10 minutes"" ""I'm afraid I can't do that Dave"" ""Why not"" ""Please stop screaming at me"" the conversations go on, but nothing ever gets done with Alexa, she's just kind of *there* for when you want to force it to shut off by pressing the button for a long time.TL;DR Good for recording a basic outline of how active you really are in your day, exercise and sleep tracking are decent but wonky and more inaccurate as you go on, and Alexa is useless go get an echo or something if you want a useful Alexa device.",4.0,Positive,"['use', 'every', 'day', 'life', 'help', 'manage', 'phone', 'call', 'texts', 'really', 'wellas', 'fitness', 'aspect', 'decent', 'lacking', 'lot', 'aspect', 'well', 'step', 'track', 'nearly', 'completely', 'inaccurate', 'turn', 'sleep', 'midnight', 'count', 'step', 'next', 'day', 'wake', 'step', 'already', 'take', 'trust', 'thats', 'sleepwalk', 'go', 'particularly', 'intense', 'car', 'ride', 'coworker', 'love', 'hit', 'well', 'speed', 'limit', 'sometimes', 'alaska', 'get', 'ice', 'heave', 'road', 'make', 'bumpy', 'ride', 'end', 'daily', 'stair', 'count', 'go', 'upthe', 'sleep', 'tracking', 'could', 'better', 'base', 'heart', 'rate', 'really', 'go', 'start', 'track', 'might', 'mean', 'minute', 'sleep', 'shave', 'get', 'homeostasisthe', 'battery', 'exactly', 'advertise', 'far', 'lasts', 'day', 'recharge', 'could', 'probably', 'go', 'least', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'depend', 'usemy', 'main', 'complaint', 'alexa', 'shes', 'totally', 'useless', 'trap', 'tiny', 'little', 'watch', 'set', 'timer', 'minute', 'im', 'afraid', 'cant', 'dave', 'please', 'stop', 'screaming', 'conversation', 'go', 'nothing', 'ever', 'get', 'do', 'alexa', 'shes', 'kind', 'want', 'force', 'shut', 'press', 'button', 'long', 'timetldr', 'good', 'record', 'basic', 'outline', 'active', 'really', 'day', 'exercise', 'sleep', 'track', 'decent', 'wonky', 'inaccurate', 'go', 'alexa', 'useless', 'go', 'get', 'echo', 'something', 'want', 'useful', 'alexa', 'device']",use every day life help manage phone call texts really wellas fitness aspect decent lacking lot aspect well step track nearly completely inaccurate turn sleep midnight count step next day wake step already take trust thats sleepwalk go particularly intense car ride coworker love hit well speed limit sometimes alaska get ice heave road make bumpy ride end daily stair count go upthe sleep tracking could better base heart rate really go start track might mean minute sleep shave get homeostasisthe battery exactly advertise far lasts day recharge could probably go least little bit longer depend usemy main complaint alexa shes totally useless trap tiny little watch set timer minute im afraid cant dave please stop screaming conversation go nothing ever get do alexa shes kind want force shut press button long timetldr good record basic outline active really day exercise sleep track decent wonky inaccurate go alexa useless go get echo something want useful alexa device

Fitbit Versa Lite Smartwatch,"I stopped using my Fitbit just last week & I've never been more happy.For a company to continue to churn out more expensive & feature-laden ""activity"" watches throughout the years, it's almost unfathomable why it would degrade its user experience year after year.It has been a love/hate relationship ever since I bought the original Versa (after upgrading from a Charge given to me by a friend, & up until then I thought Fitbits were useless, trendy gadgets) because when the watch & app/software work, it's a very useful tool with a lot of data & information to help keep a person motivated & track their progress... but the inconsistency of the heart rate monitor, problems with syncing, app updates that are forced upon users otherwise their watch stops working with the app, non-existent customer service and/or totally inefficient customer care made life with a Fitbit one of frustration.Due to these factors & probably more, I vowed to myself to never spend another dime on a terrible company like Fitbit...but my Versa died in early 2020 (with an almost offensive lack of customer support to try & help) & I read some good things about the Samsung Galaxy activity watch so I switched & started using that, but with a terrible app & an even worse heart rate monitor & active time logger I broke my vow & purchased this Vera Lite.Even worse than the Versa, the heart rate monitor & problems with syncing on the Versa Lite I soldiered on because the app data & statistics are very helpful even if there are some discrepancies.But the final straw & what made me finally jump ship was the firmware upgrade pushed out late September/early October, as I had seen multiple complaints on the new ""zone minutes"" by beta testers posted on Fitbit's forum... yet Fitbit still forced this upgrade out to its user base, and as soon is it went out to, I'm assuming, thousands of users, the forum was flooded with average users confused & angry & wanting the old ""activity minutes"" back instead of this new ""zone minutes"" garbage.Not to mention all the complaints about their Fitbits not syncing anymore, getting bricked & staying on the Fitbit startup logo, not turning on at all, Fitbit ""updating"" their list of compatible phones so that users having problems now after the upgrade were officially SOL despite their watch & phone being compatible before... this all made me very scared so I dismissed the upgrade as long as I could (maybe 10-12 days), closing out the banner at the top of the app EVERY single time I opened it or refreshed the screen, but of course, after so many days my watch stopped syncing with my Samsung Ultra+ (& also my old Samsung S8, which I always used as a backup to sync with when the Fitbit was being temperamental with my Ultra+) & I had no choice but to upgrade the firmware.And exactly what you'd expect to happen did in fact happen: my watch wouldn't sync with either of my phones at all anymore...& I wound following the god-awful advice that is copy & pasted on Fitbit's forums for almost every single issue a user has, which is a long list of absolutely inconvenient & obtuse set of instructions that seem more long-winded & complex than dismantling an atomic bomb.I did the first couple of steps, anyway... & then my phone never was able to re-sync with the Fitbit & I gave up...I downloaded a step-tracker because I have my phone in my pocket 95% of the time anyway, it seems quite accurate, & MyFitnessPal gives the option to add exercises with caloric expenditure calculated for you already & now I'm finally free.",1.0,Negative,"['stop', 'use', 'fitbit', 'last', 'week', 'ive', 'never', 'happyfor', 'company', 'continue', 'churn', 'expensive', 'featureladen', 'activity',

Fitbit Versa Lite Smartwatch,"I thought I did my research well enough on this device, but I was mistaken. I really wanted to love this smartwatch/fitness tracker. I don't have a lot of needs, but I need them all met, and based on the spec sheet and advertised featureset this should cover everything.What I liked about this device:- Long battery life- Lightweight- Gets all my app notifications- Fitness trackingWhat the marketing material doesn't say:- Setup is a nightmare. The device ships with a firmware version that needs to be plugged into a PC in order to be able to update itself to a firmware version that can update OTA; except Windows 10 doesn't recognize the device when plugged in and Fitbit doesn't have drivers available on their website. Then once you get the device updated, there's still a slew of connectivity issues getting the device to pair properly with your phone.- The app notifications are inconsistent at best. There aren't many apps I actually want notifications from, but the few I do want I need them consistently. Sometimes they come through and everything is great, and other times they don't come at all and the troubleshooting steps to fix them is to reinstall the Fitbit software, reconfigure the device (and all of its settings), and restart both my phone and the watch.Here's the kicker: these are problems occurring in the first 24 hours! I haven't even had the device for a full day yet and I'm having all these problems. My last smartwatch, an LG G Watch R, was made in 2014 and didn't have any of these problems. It's 2020 Fitbit, this level of inadequacy is unacceptable.This device is a sleek and stylish fitness tracker, and does those tasks well enough, but if that was all I wanted there are better devices (even better Fitbit devices) that do that job. I bought the Versa Lite because I needed app notifications, and having to reconfigure the device daily isn't going to work out for me.I'm giving this a few more days to see if things stabilize before I return it.---EDIT: I've owned this for a week. The setup process is a nightmare because it ships with a buggy version of the firmware, and there's no way to force or sideload the update. You just have to wait DAYS until the device finally decides to update. After the update, many of the problems went away.Coincidentally, I got myself a new phone about a day after I got the update and once I paired the FitBit to my new phone things that never worked on my old phone suddenly worked on the new one.Pre-update + old phone: 2/5 starsPost-update + old phone: 3/5 starsPost-update + new phone: 4/5 starsI'll be updating my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars because once it's fully updated it's everything I wanted from it, but the horrible out-of-the-box experience cannot be overlooked.

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,"Had the Charge 2 for a while and loved it. Then switched to the latest apple watch at the encouragement of a few friends. While that apple watch was nice for the few months I wore it, I found I was not using a lot of the features in it that may have been why it was double the cost of the Versa. On the apple watch I found the battery would not last more than 36 hours and the phone app was no where near what Fitbit had in terms of activity and sleep tracking as well as just overall display of the many data points.When the Versa came out I said why not try it, hearing how slim it was and the extended battery life. It was that or go back to my Charge 2 that is also a fantastic tracker. My goal was to get back to the Fitbit app. I love this watch/fitness tracker and know this is going to be a huge hit for Fitbit. The app I love is now back in my life for the detailed activity and sleep tracker and the battery life is nearly as good as my Charge 2. I have gotten five days of battery life on the Fitbit Versa already - this is with a 45 minute workout on each of those five days included. At the end of the five days I was at 28% remaining, telling me I had another day or two of charge remaining. The texts all come through, the watch rings when I get a all on my iPhone, the screen is crystal clear, the watch itself is very slim compared to apple(no bump on the underside), there must be hundreds of clock faces to choose from, and it has all the apps I could think of needing in the watch store (the store is already noticeably growing). This is the fitness tracker\watch to get. Very impressed and kudos to Fitbit for a well thought out fitness focused watch that is a true competitor to the apple watch.Just a quick comment on the setup of the Versa. I saw a few comments here about how the setup took 30 minutes or so to complete with an update. My comment is so what? I just put my Versa on the charger, used the app to update it, walked away, came back and wha-la - it was done!

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,"I had an original Huawei smart watch that I loved every thing about except battery life. I could get a day out of it if I only used it for a watch and notifications. If I tried to make use of many apps on it then I could forget it lasting a whole day. It was nice to have Google assistant to control my smart home but unfortunately it quit taking a charge so I started looking for something new.I decided battery life was important for me as I couldn't use many of the ""smart"" features anyway on the Huawei due to battery life impact. And I wanted to have better fitness integration also.I decided to go with the Fitbit Versa and I am glad I did. It is well documented how well the battery life and fitness tracking work so I will not say more than it does a better job than I expected and I love the sleep tracking!I want to talk about the smart watch side of the Versa. Of course I wish I could talk to it and use Google assistant but I will give it up for battery life. I wanted to be able to control music and podcasts playback from my watch and was worried how this was going to work. All I had to do was go into settings and enable notifications from the apps I want to control and then I can start a play list or podcast on my phone. From the watch I only have swipe down, open the notification, and the controls are there! I used to build my own watchfaces on the Huawei watch with the ""watch maker"" app. I found a similar app in the fitbit app store called ""maker"". I haven't tried it yet as I am happy with the fitbit watch face I am using for now, but I am happy to the option is there for when I get bored and want to change things up later. It was nice being able to control my smartthings lights with the Google assistant on the Huawei but I can use my phone if needed and I have Alexa and Google home all over my house for that so it is less important. There is an app called ""switchr"" that will let me press buttons on my Versa to control them but I have not figured it out yet. That's my fault not the Versa as I have not used IFTTT much and I need to fix things on that end.Overall this is the perfect watch for me. It has all of the smarts that I care about. Of course Fitbit has the fitness part down as that's what they are known for. And I get the best of both worlds with great battery life.

Fitbit Sense Advanced Smartwatch,"UPDATE: 2 FULL YEARS later practically to the date. My SENSE crapped out. Was a good Smartwatch up until it just started not working (only showed fitbit icon, intermittent vibration, would work for a few hours, then go back to showing nothing. Was a quick death). Not changing rating as all these gadgets are basically throw aways. Now back to original review:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Probably want to select reviews based on ""most recent"" as that will provide you with most up to date and relevant information pertaining to this product. I acquired my Fitbit Sense in June 2021, it has not yet been a month, but so far so good with 24/7 use. I am slow to check out and use all the features, but what I have interacted with so far has been stellar.I have been using Fitbit products since April 2015- kinda have a love/hate relationship with this brand. I use the activity tracker constantly, and I greatly enjoy the app. So I have stuck with it as I upgraded over the years (Charge x2, Blaze x2, Versa 2, and now Sense). As with many Fitbit users, there is a known frustration with the products. Despite some of my own qualms, and having the ability to spend whatever I want on any fitness tracker I want, I still end up (so far) with this brand. Mostly because I haven't found a tracker and app that I totally like better. I even have a Garmin, but I find that so far off base of accuracy (save for HR), that it is a glorified watch. Garmin seems to do best for actual intended activities (going for a run, going for a long walk, going cycling) where it seems to not be accurate in steps for any other part of the day (only counts about 1/3 of actual steps unless engaged in a longer duration activity, and even then it takes a few minutes for it to start). Also, the app seems to have a lot of info, but doent really tell me anything. That being said, when it was time for me to buy another fitness tracker--I went from Versa 2 to Garmin.. back to Fitbit. I went with the Sense because the price was right, and it was an upgrade over the Versa 2.  After my underwhelming experience with the Garmin, I would have happily taken over a 2nd hand Charge from 2015. At least my steps would be accurate.Ok, so back to the Sense. WOW, the visual on the screen is really clear and precise. Even way more so over the Versa 2, and I had no issues with that. Set up was EASY, and QUICK.  Basically, just like in adding any other fitbit, just let it pair and it will very quickly be all set and ready to go. I didnt have any weird upselling offerings, or at least nothing that wasn't fantastically easy to opt out from. Nothing shady that I saw.ONE POINT that I DO think is important to know is that if you happen to have a Versa 2 (Not sure if this also happens with regular Versa, Versa Lite, or Versa 3), but this could not be added alongside my Versa 2. I had to take the Versa 2 offline in order to add this Sense. I know this is the case with trying to add more than one of the same products, yet I have always been able to have several Fitbits paired no problem, as long as they were different models. SO, I guess the Fitbit app sees Sense and Versa 2 as the same. Not a big deal as my Versa 2 had essentially died after I wore it on a hot humid day and my sweat killed it (then I brought it back to life after putting it in a bag of rice for about a week, Then afterward the battery was never the same. It drained to nothing daily.. and I needed to not have to worry about daily charging.. hence my picking up a Garmin in the interim to see if I liked them enough to spring for a more fancy model--nope-- and ended up buying the Sense.)Hope it lasts. I love the look. The band is way better than the old pin style. Swapping out bands is so much quicker, easier, less need for super fine motor skills. LOVE the charger. It just sort of magnetizes to the fitbit. No need to clip in.SP02 wasn't the main feature I was drawn to, but in order to have accurate use it seems a special clock face is needed, and that clock face will drain battery quicker (from what I have read). That being said,Battery life has been excellent for me.Love being able to add other apps, and features.  Scrolling is easy, turning face on/off is not complicated.HEART RATE is accurate. I have tested it against my garmin, two blood pressure devices, and a doctors appointment. All saying the same.Also, I the voice assistant is great. You can choose GOOGLE Assistant, OR Alexa. This is why selecting most recent reviews on this sort of stuff is important, as the early release of Sense did not have Google Assistant, but would soon with an update. True, and they followed through as I have it.AT THIS TIME, I have ZERO issues, concerns with this Fitbit Sense. I will be back to update as I learn more, or if I have anything worth sharing that is bad. I keep up with my reviews as needed.",5.0,Positive,"['update', 'full', 'year', 'later', 'practically', 'date', 'sense', 'crap', 'good', 'smartwatch', 'start', 'work', 'show', 'fitbit', 'icon',

Fitbit Sense Advanced Smartwatch,"The watch is great with calories, zone minutes and steps! It also records quality of sleep, which is great to keep track of. The only problem I have is the distance, which seems to be an issue. The watch has a problem distinguishing between miles and kilometers, and doesn’t record my 5 miles until I’ve walked 8.05 miles (8.05 kilometers=approximately 5 miles). Fitbit seems to be aware of this issue, but has not corrected it.

Fitbit Sense Advanced Smartwatch,"Updated Review:I initially gave it a 4 Star rating but just changed it to 5 Stars. I was having difficulty with viewing the daily rating of my Oxygen while sleeping. Some times it would register, other times it would not. I finally discovered that it was measuring my O2 level all the time. The results does not show up right away as you have to wait for a short time to appear.It did show me an upward trend in my temperature, resting heart rate, temperature variability with a downward trend in my Heart Rate Variability (HRV) when I came down with a nasty cold. I could trace it to the date it started.Original Review:The watch is pretty stylish. Comparing it to my sister's huge Samsung watch, this watch is sleeker and filled with more health features than hers.For accuracy, it is pretty good, but not perfect. I walked exactly 100 steps by counting them out, and the Sense showed 102. I'm pretty impressed with that. The sleep feature seems accurate when it measures the time fell asleep until the time I woke up. Even though it may not be totally accurate against more accurate medical-grade devices, it does give me a baseline and I can measure my progress from that. The heartbeat rate is pretty much on target but I haven’t tested it above 120 where some people have issues with it being accurate.What I find inaccurate: 1) the stairs counter. It misses counting about 4 out of 5 times. If I go down the stairs to the main floor and then back up again, I count 32 steps. 2) I find the SpO2 function pretty useless. First, it is not anywhere close when compared with two actual SpO2 devices. Secondly, sometimes it records while sleeping and other nights it fails to record for no known reason. There are a number of similar complaints and frustration on the Fitbit forum about this same problem. Also, you must use their clock face to record, which I find inconvenient. So, if you are thinking about getting this watch primarily for that feature, I would caution you.Other than that complaint, the watch is quite nice. The charging device is genius, you bring it near the watch, and it instantly connects. Charging times are very short, so that's a big plus. If you use it to record your sleep and then throughout the day, you might get 2 to 3 days between charges.Nice to have the texting and phone calls feature. Sometimes when I have my phone on vibrate only, I miss the call, but now with the Sense, I feel the vibration on my wrist notifying me of who it is. I can read a partial window of the text message too. When my phone is not on vibrate, I can text the person back through the voice feature. I can answer the call and talk to them through my watch; however, you have to hold the phone near your ear to hear them as the speaker is pretty weak.There is a learning curve if you are a first-time Fitbit user. This is true with the watch and with the App. The App is filled with many graphs and features. It will take some time to learn where they all are located, but eventually you will be able to navigate and find them. Speaking of navigation, if you swipe down on the watch to delve deeper into an app, you can swipe back up, but you cannot go back to the previous feature or forward to the next. You must press the button to go back home first where you must start your navigation over. I hope Fitbit improves upon this feature in the future.The silicone watch band was quite difficult to clasp and unclasp. It wasn't the most comfortable either, possibly because my wrist was in between the sizing holes. The nice feature of the band is that it only takes a couple of seconds to change them out. I purchased a nice elastic one-piece band that allows me to take the watch off and put it back on within 2 to 3 seconds. Here is the Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KFFSHBH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1 and there are two sizes. I do recommend this band as it comes in a variety of colors and patterns.So, in conclusion, would I recommend this watch? I would say yes as long as you are not needing it for the SpO2 feature which I find unreliable.",5.0,Positive,"['update', 'reviewi', 'initially', 'give', 'star', 'rating', 'change', 'star',

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,"This is my third Fitbit in one year.  Beware of Fitbits....  Bought the first one for my wife for Christmas, about 6 months ago.  It died within two weeks.  So I reached out to Amazon, and was able to get a replacement due to how quickly it failed.  So I started using the second one, that one failed after a couple of months, in March, just beyond the return window.  I was not able to get a replacement due to timing....  so I bought a refurbished one.  Now I am in June, and the refurbished onehas now failed.  So this is the third failure of a fitbit I was using within 6 months, and only one of the failures was fast enough to generate a warranty replacement.

They said there’s nothing they can do because the first person that purchased it bought it in 2020 or 2021 and the warranty is gone. I didn’t even buy it until 2024 of January and it already broke by the time it was January 2025. so. It said nothing about an expiredcwatranty when I bought the watch. Normally, I always buy brand new but I did not want to spend top dollar on something that I knew would break anyway. I pleaded with them to replae it or be able to buy one for half price or 75% off if they did not replace it for free. All they offered was a 35% off coupon and that is not acceptable.

Fitbit Versa 2,"I was a little bit wary of buying a used product. However, my Fitbit game in absolutely perfect condition. There are no signs of wear whatsoever, not even the tiniest scratch! The display is just stunning and so pleasing to look at. So far, the battery life has been incredible. It came at around 56% when I first turned it on, and is at 51% now 24 hours later. The step tracking, heart rate monitor,  and calories burned seems to be good so far, and are all very convenient features to be able to see so easily and quickly. I have not yet used the sleep tracking function yet. I really like being able to see texts, calls, and the time without needing to carry my phone with me everywhere I go, especially at work when I'm frequently moving around but need to watch the time closely. Pairing the Fitbit with my phone was seamless and fast. Also, the watch just looks so pretty and compliments any outfit well. Even just wearing the watch has motivated me to get more movement in. I'm not sure if I will try to go swimming with this watch any time soon, just in case. Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this purchase.

Fitbit Versa 2,Fitbit is in pretty good condition for being refurbished.  Some light scratching on the face that you can really only see in the right light.  .Taking away a star because the band that came with is nearly impossible to put on the watch.  It's too wide and the silicone has to be squished for there to even be a chance to get it on the watch.  I did have another band from a previous Fitbit that worked perfectly.And also the battery doesn't last as sling as I'd like.  Fully changed to 90% after using the workout function for 35 minutes.  And then drains slightly throughout the day.  I have to charge it every few days or so.  My other Fitbit would last over a week on a charge.

Google Pixel Watch 3,"This is a fantastic watch.  I've been a long-time Fossil smartwatch user.  My Fossil Gen 6 watch started acting up, and I recently learned that Fossil has exited smartwatches.  Once I switched to the Pixel 3, I was thrilled and do not miss my Gen 6 at all.  I should have switched sooner.My 2nd Fossil replacement alternative was the OnePlus 2.  The Pixel looked better (to me) and has Wear OS 5 which is the most recent version.  It was hard to decide between the two using online descriptions and reviews, but I am happy with my choice.  The Pixel battery life is better than the Fossil, even with the always on display, and easily gets me though the day.  The charge may not last as long as the OnePlus 2, but I do not wear it overnight and instead put the watch on the charger, so the extra battery life is not an issue for me.  Others may see this differently.The Pixel 3 screen is MUCH brighter and sharper than the Fossil, the processor is faster, and the watch operation is intuitive and easy to learn.  Activating the watch, setting it up, and switching from the Fossil was quick and easy since most of the apps and info are tied to my Google account.Long-time irritants with the Fossil were how the end of the watch band kept flopping loose from its holder band, and how the crown button constantly activated when I sharply bent my wrist.  The Pixel fixes both of these issues.  The Pixel watch band is a bit tricky to attach at first (YouTube helps), but it works MUCH better than the Fossil and is more comfortable.  The Pixel has a nice feature where you can rotate the watch display 180 degrees (make it upside down) so you can wear the crown button on the left side of the watch.  No more accidental app activations, restarts, or 911 calls!My primary watch use is for business to monitor emails and texts, and to see/screen/take phone calls.  All these work beautifully, and are handled much better than with the Fossil.  Even the weather app is upgraded in the new OS, and there is a timer that can be added to the tiles.  I use my watch secondarily for the health features, and I was sad (at first) to learn Google Fit would not be on the Pixel.  I used Fit on the Fossil to track steps and distance walked.  The new FitBit basic version is a true upgrade and gives me all the info I had before, plus a lot more.  I did not opt for the free Premium FitBit trial.I bought and recommend a set of the plastic watch covers for scratch and impact protection, and a charging stand.  Both work great.",5.0,Positive,"['fantastic', 'watch', 'ive', 'longtime', 'fossil', 'smartwatch', 'user', 'fossil', 'gen', 'watch', 'start', 'act', 'recently', 'learn', 'fossil', 'exit', 'smartwatches', 'switch', 'pixel', 'thrill', 'miss', 'gen', 'switch', 'soonermy', 'nd', 'fossil', 'replacement', 'alternative', 'oneplus', 'pixel', 'look', 'well', 'wear', 'os', 'recent', 'version', 'hard', 'decide', 'two', 'use', 'online', 'description', 'review', 'happy', 'choice', 'pixel', 'battery', 'life', 'well', 'fossil', 'even', 'always', 'display', 'easily', 'get', 'though', 'day', 'charge', 'may', 'last', 'long', 'oneplus', 'wear', 'overnight', 'instead', 'put', 'watch', 'charger', 'extra', 'battery', 'life', 'issue', 'others', 'may', 'see', 'differentlythe', 'pixel', 'screen', 'much', 'brighter', 'sharper', 'fossil', 'processor', 'faster', 'watch', 'operation', 'intuitive', 'easy', 'learn', 'activate', 'watch', 'set', 'switch', 'fossil', 'quick', 'easy', 'since', 'application', 'info', 'tie', 'google', 'accountlongtime', 'irritant', 'fossil', 'end', 'watch', 'band', 'keep', 'flop', 'loose', 'holder', 'band', 'crown', 'button', 'constantly', 'activate', 'sharply', 'bent', 'wrist', 'pixel', 'fix', 'issue', 'pixel', 'watch', 'band', 'bit', 'tricky', 'attach', 'first', 'youtube', 'help', 'work', 'much', 'well', 'fossil', 'comfortable', 'pixel', 'nice', 'feature', 'rotate', 'watch', 'display', 'degree', 'make', 'upside', 'wear', 'crown', 'button', 'leave', 'side', 'watch', 'accidental', 'application', 'activation', 'restart', 'callsmy', 'primary', 'watch', 'use', 'business', 'monitor', 'email', 'texts', 'seescreentake', 'phone', 'call', 'work', 'beautifully', 'handle', 'much', 'well', 'fossil', 'even', 'weather', 'application', 'upgrade', 'new', 'os', 'timer', 'add', 'tile', 'use', 'watch', 'secondarily', 'health', 'feature', 'sad', 'first', 'learn', 'google', 'fit', 'would', 'pixel', 'use', 'fit', 'fossil', 'track', 'step', 'distance', 'walk', 'new', 'fitbit', 'basic', 'version', 'true', 'upgrade', 'give', 'info', 'plus', 'lot', 'opt', 'free', 'premium', 'fitbit', 'triali', 'buy', 'recommend', 'set', 'plastic', 'watch', 'cover', 'scratch', 'impact', 'protection', 'charge', 'stand', 'work', 'great']",fantastic watch ive longtime fossil smartwatch user fossil gen watch start act recently learn fossil exit smartwatches switch pixel thrill miss gen switch soonermy nd fossil replacement alternative oneplus pixel look well wear os recent version hard decide two use online description review happy choice pixel battery life well fossil even always display easily get though day charge may last long oneplus wear overnight instead put watch charger extra battery life issue others may see differentlythe pixel screen much brighter sharper fossil processor faster watch operation intuitive easy learn activate watch set switch fossil quick easy since application info tie google accountlongtime irritant fossil end watch band keep flop loose holder band crown button constantly activate sharply bent wrist pixel fix issue pixel watch band bit tricky attach first youtube help work much well fossil comfortable pixel nice feature rotate watch display degree make upside wear crown button leave side watch accidental application activation restart callsmy primary watch use business monitor email texts seescreentake phone call work beautifully handle much well fossil even weather application upgrade new os timer add tile use watch secondarily health feature sad first learn google fit would pixel use fit fossil track step distance walk new fitbit basic version true upgrade give info plus lot opt free premium fitbit triali buy recommend set plastic watch cover scratch impact protection charge stand work great

Google Pixel Watch 3,"I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.  When my Fitbit Versa died I waited a while before buying another. Instead I tried a couple of cheaper watches but didn't like the app they used.  I missed the Fitbit app.  I didn't want to order another Versa so I decided to try the Google Pixel 3 even though the watch was round and not square as my previous watch.

Fitbit Sense Health & Fitness,"I have order 4 of the Fitbit Sense 1 watches and had to return all of them.  This watch is obsolete likely due to Fitbit not updating it's software to operate correctly with legacy products.  There are many know problems with this watch and they are likely the reason Fitbit created the Sense 2.1) The button designed to pull you back to the home screen rarely works.2) The heart rate monitor is wildly inaccurate which leads to inaccurate measurements with exercise, sleep and the other cardio functions.The screen shots are of stairmaster sessions I had.  I wore a chest strap heart rate monitor and that device showed my heart rate moving from about 100 to 150 in a linear path.  At no point did my heart rate drop more than a few beats.  You can see the Fitbit charts depict an implausible scenario.  This has been the case with all 4 of the Sense watches I have had.I have followed suggestions found on the internet Appling water between the watch and my skin; wearing the watch tighter, looser, over the wrist and under the wrist.

Fitbit Sense Health & Fitness,"I upgraded to the Fitbit Sense after my Versa 2, which I loved, died. I thought that, since it was a newer product, that it would be better. It still has all the functions I liked on the Versa 2 and I do like the addition of stress monitoring and skin temperature tracking. Also, now I don't need a special clock face to have SPO2 monitoring, which is good. But overall, I was greatly disappointed.First, it regularly loses connection with the phone/app, even when the phone is less than five feet away. I am also seeing a lot more sync errors than I saw with the Versa 2. Sometimes, even when the watch has synced and I can see things like my sleep score in the app, it won't show on the watch for hours.Some of the features I was looking forward to, like snore detection and SPO2 monitoring, are a battery suck. The watch is advertised as having 6+ days of battery life, but my initial experience had me needing to charge it every day. After several attempts to find the problem through customer service, I was told to turn off the snore monitoring. This increased the life to about 5 days. It makes no sense to me that they would not make sure that the battery supports the use of a built-in function. I have also had several issues with the watch somehow, on its own, opening the exercise app and getting stuck there. The only way to get out of it has been to restart the watch.The watch band is another problem. The design of the band for the newer smart watches is awful. As seen in pictures, instead of the end of the band being secured under a loop, this one has a tuck under design so that the end is sandwiched between the strap and your skin. This design is uncomfortable and has caused a lot of chafing on my wrist. This is something that I never experienced with the Versa 2 watch band. The only good thing I can say about this new design is that it is easier to change the band as it just clips in rather than needing to fuss and fumble with the pins on traditional watch bands.I am mostly happy with the Sense. It does what I need it to and the issues I have faced are not enough to keep me from getting another Fitbit product in the future. I just hope the issues I am having, and those I have seen in others' reviews, are addressed in future product designs.",3.0,Neutral,"['upgraded', 'fitbit', 'sense', 'versa', 'love', 'die', 'think', 'since', 'new', 'product', 'would', 'better', 'still', 'function', 'like', 'versa', 'like', 'addition', 'stress', 'monitoring', 'skin', 'temperature', 'track', 'also', 'dont', 'need', 'special', 'clock', 'face', 'spo', 'monitor', 'good', 'overall', 'greatly', 'disappointedfirst', 'regularly', 'loses', 'connection', 'phoneapp', 'even', 'phone', 'less', 'five', 'foot', 'away', 'also', 'see', 'lot', 'sync', 'error', 'saw', 'versa', 'sometimes', 'even', 'watch', 'sync', 'see', 'thing', 'like', 'sleep', 'score', 'application', 'wont', 'show', 'watch', 'hourssome', 'feature', 'look', 'forward', 'like', 'snore', 'detection', 'spo', 'monitoring', 'battery', 'suck', 'watch', 'advertise', 'day', 'battery', 'life', 'initial', 'experience', 'need', 'charge', 'every', 'day', 'several', 'attempt', 'find', 'problem', 'customer', 'service', 'tell', 'turn', 'snore', 'monitoring', 'increased', 'life', 'day', 'make', 'sense', 'would', 'make', 'sure', 'battery', 'support', 'use', 'builtin', 'function', 'also', 'several', 'issue', 'watch', 'somehow', 'opening', 'exercise', 'application', 'get', 'stuck', 'way', 'get', 'restart', 'watchthe', 'watch', 'band', 'another', 'problem', 'design', 'band', 'new', 'smart', 'watch', 'awful', 'see', 'picture', 'instead', 'end', 'band', 'secure', 'loop', 'one', 'tuck', 'design', 'end', 'sandwich', 'strap', 'skin', 'design', 'uncomfortable', 'cause', 'lot', 'chafe', 'wrist', 'something', 'never', 'experience', 'versa', 'watch', 'band', 'good', 'thing', 'say', 'new', 'design', 'easy', 'change', 'band', 'clip', 'rather', 'need', 'fuss', 'fumble', 'pin', 'traditional', 'watch', 'bandsi', 'mostly', 'happy', 'sense', 'need', 'issue', 'face', 'enough', 'keep', 'get', 'another', 'fitbit', 'product', 'future', 'hope', 'issue', 'see', 'others', 'review', 'address', 'future', 'product', 'design']",upgraded fitbit sense versa love die think since new product would better still function like versa like addition stress monitoring skin temperature track also dont need special clock face spo monitor good overall greatly disappointedfirst regularly loses connection phoneapp even phone less five foot away also see lot sync error saw versa sometimes even watch sync see thing like sleep score application wont show watch hourssome feature look forward like snore detection spo monitoring battery suck watch advertise day battery life initial experience need charge every day several attempt find problem customer service tell turn snore monitoring increased life day make sense would make sure battery support use builtin function also several issue watch somehow opening exercise application get stuck way get restart watchthe watch band another problem design band new smart watch awful see picture instead end band secure loop one tuck design end sandwich strap skin design uncomfortable cause lot chafe wrist something never experience versa watch band good thing say new design easy change band clip rather need fuss fumble pin traditional watch bandsi mostly happy sense need issue face enough keep get another fitbit product future hope issue see others review address future product design

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,"I have bought every Fitbit that the company made to include this one. I even bought the scale and two sets of Flyers. I really enjoy each watch and I am a big fan of Fitbit’s. I enjoy the look of the Versa and the feel of it. It is lighter the the Ionic, which is a great watch too. Amazon delivered it at a timely matter. No problems with Amazon at all. However, after ordering the Versa, I found out that you cannot have two watches (I have the ionic and this one now) working simultaneously on one account. I did not know this until after I ordered the watch and tried to cancel the order upto 3 hours later but it was too late. In order for me to wear them both using the same account is to sync all the latest stats then delete the one watch and put the other watch on the account. This takes over about 30 minutes for the switch over time and you must have WiFi. The second  watch then states that you walked zero steps but your phone app states the correct amount of steps added from both watches. I walk over 42,000 to 45,000 steps per day. I need to walk a certain amount of steps per hour to achieve this total. After switching watches, I would need my phone app to see if I am achieving my hourly goal. I cannot do this at times because I cannot have my phone while I work.  Also, a very tiny dislike to this watch, is that there are not a lot of watch faces for this watch but give it time, it’s the newest one they have so there could be more coming in the future.  If I could give Amazon 4 stars, I would but I gave Fitbit only one star (wish I could give it only 1/2 of one) for not being able to run two watches simultaneously on one account.

Fitbit Versa Lite Edition Smart,"This is actually a replacement for a previous Versa Lite which gave up after a fairly long life. I get compliments for the color which is always nice.

Fitbit Versa Lite Edition Smart,"Initially, I loved this watch. I was given a Versa watch before this, but it fell apart; literally it came apart after a year and I'm not rough with watches at all. But, I really enjoyed it so I bought this one (Versa Lite) in August 2020. Sigh. It worked great. It was really doing a good job motivating me with my steps and fitness. Then a week ago, I made the fatal mistake of updating to the constantly suggested firmware. Before the update, my watch stayed charged at least 4 days, after the update it would need recharging every 12 hours. Then just a day ago it started only holding a charge for 2 hours or so. And now, today, my Fitbit just completely died. I'm really disappointed that after 5 months and $110, my Fitbit died. I can't bring myself to purchase another one even though I really love it because after a quick Google search, the reduced battery charge after completing firmware updates seems to have been an ongoing issue since at least 2016. But in my case, all they did was convince a guaranteed lifetime customer to seek a different product, which is very disheartening considering how much I really loved their Versa brand.UPDATE: I called Fitbit, they troubleshot my watch, confirmed I was still under warranty and gave me a choice of 50% off an upgraded watch or send another replacement of my current watch for free. I like my current watch, so I opted for that. If your watch is giving you problems or dies and it's been less than a year since you purchased it, call them and they will help you find the best solution.

Fitbit Versa Lite Edition Smart,"The screen is now AMOLED, yielding brighter colors and deeper blacks.The glass cover no longer has a bezel, giving it a smooth, low profile and premium look.The optical sensor on the bottom is bigger and doesn't protrude from the case, making it more comfortable on the wrist.The music and exercise buttons are gone.

Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things.

Google Pixel Watch 2,"Item Purchased: Black Pre-Owned Google Pixel Watch 2The watch arrived in a resealed, open-box Google Pixel Watch 2 package. It included both watch band sizes and a USB-C charging cable, but no wall outlet—so if you don’t already have a USB-C wall charger, you may want to pick one up.The watch face was pristine and the device was very clean—overall, in excellent condition.Out of the box, the watch had a 34% charge and paired easily with my OnePlus phone. Even at that battery level, the battery saver mode held up well through a full 8-hour shift.Today, after a full charge, I used the watch mainly to track steps, check time, monitor health, and control media. I don’t get a lot of notifications or spend much time fiddling with it, and by the end of my 8-hour shift, the battery was still at 78%.

Google Pixel Watch 2,This watch is an upgrade from any Fitbit model in my opinion.

Google Pixel Watch 2,"So I quickly learned after getting the watch a few days ago to go into the watch's settings, click battery, and turn on the battery saver. To have your watch come on, you gently tap the screen or press the crown button. This has greatly improved the battery life. But YOU shouldn't have to do that with a watch that costs this much.On the plus side, you can change just about every setting imaginable, and the Fitbit is a nice touch (despite most of the good features behind a subscription service). That's called Google greed. You'll get used to it. They're a monopoly for a reason. Using it to make and receive calls is awesome. Got a call the other day and was able to talk as I washed the dishes. No earbuds are required. The person who called me said the audio was great.I highly recommend this if you don't mind the craptacular battery life. I'm surprised they didn't fix it with a software update. Something is feasting on the power. Or they went with the lowest bidder for parts.Oh, if you have fat fingers or medium-sized ones, forget about the keyboard. LOL. You'll need a stylus (yes they work). The speech-to-text is very good but you have to remember to say ""period"" or ""comma"" when composing messages. If you don't, it'll be one long sentence without proper punctuation. You can even say ""heart emoji"" and it'll insert that. You can also go back and edit the message with your fingers and use the keyboard to correct mistakes. I'll update my review if needed and the longer I use it. Oh, the ECG works and is very cool.

Google Pixel Watch 2,"I had to replace my aging Galaxy S3 Frontier which is at it's end of life. I love that watch! I was going to get either a Galaxy S6 Pro or a Pixel Watch 2. After much soul searching, I knew I had to make a decision. so the gambler in me decided to try something new.  I'm glad I did!Now clearly, a watch released less than 6 months ago is going to out perform one released 6 or 7 years ago. But  the improvement in performance is remarkable.It's faster responding, pairs quickly and easily with my Pixel 6a smartphone, and has superior software.It's really the software that makes the smartwatch useful and productive. And to Samsung's credit, they kept my old war horse's software current.  But, the Fitbit software is much more modern than Samsung Health. It can scan barcode label on food packages when I record what I eat and it is much more flexible in terms of how the nutrient servings list is recorded.  And that means less manual calculations when trying adjust servings from grams to, say, ounces.Heart monitoring is more accurate, stair climbing is much more accurate, and sleep monitoring is actually usable. It might be the advancements in sensor quality rather than the software algorithms. But I do trust the results more.Charging the battery is FAST.  I get about 36 hours of life from the battery, on about 45 minutes of charging. Twenty minutes of charging while I shower in the morning will give me about 12 hours of battery life.  The wireless magnetic charger is a little different from the Samsung watch, but it is very functional. The user needs to make sure that the crown and stem is parallel to the power cord, and once the watch is about an inch away from the charger, the charger is drawn to the watch magnetically and it leaps up and connects to the watch. This is not BS on my part, it happens everyday. Only once has this connection not been made perfectly.The PW 2, is smaller and lighter, physically.  It's about the size of a traditional men's mechanical dress watch. My ancient eyes can see the slightly smaller screen with ease.  My arthritic gorilla fingers akso have no problem manipulating the screen.  It is comfortable to wear long term, even to bed, for sleep monitoring.  It offers a more classy and elegant appearance than the larger and sportier S6 Pro.I was comfortable with the new user interface within a day or two; so I think people coming from another brand won't have a huge learning curve. Like the Pixel Smartphones, Google uses a simple and uncluttered interface that I found very intuitive.I am quite pleased with my purchase,and can recommend it to others.",5.0,Positive,"['replace', 'age', 'galaxy', 'frontier', 'end', 'life', 'love', 'watch', 'go', 'get', 'either', 'galaxy', 'pro', 'pixel', 'watch', 'much', 'soul', 'search', 'knew', 'make', 'decision', 'gambler', 'decide', 'try', 'something', 'new', 'im', 'glad', 'didnow', 'clearly', 'watch', 'release', 'less', 'month', 'ago', 'go', 'perform', 'one', 'release', 'year', 'ago', 'improvement', 'performance', 'remarkableits', 'faster', 'respond', 'pair', 'quickly', 'easily', 'pixel', 'smartphone', 'superior', 'softwareits', 'really', 'software', 'make', 'smartwatch', 'useful', 'productive', 'samsungs', 'credit', 'keep', 'old', 'war', 'horse', 'software', 'current', 'fitbit', 'software', 'much', 'modern', 'samsung', 'health', 'scan', 'barcode', 'label', 'food', 'package', 'record', 'eat', 'much', 'flexible', 'term', 'nutrient', 'serving', 'list', 'record', 'mean', 'less', 'manual', 'calculation', 'try', 'adjust', 'serving', 'gram', 'say', 'ouncesheart', 'monitoring', 'accurate', 'stair', 'climb', 'much', 'accurate', 'sleep', 'monitoring', 'actually', 'usable', 'might', 'advancement', 'sensor', 'quality', 'rather', 'software', 'algorithms', 'trust', 'result', 'morecharging', 'battery', 'fast', 'get', 'hour', 'life', 'battery', 'minute', 'charge', 'twenty', 'minute', 'charge', 'shower', 'morning', 'give', 'hour', 'battery', 'life', 'wireless', 'magnetic', 'charger', 'little', 'different', 'samsung', 'watch', 'functional', 'user', 'need', 'make', 'sure', 'crown', 'stem', 'parallel', 'power', 'cord', 'watch', 'inch', 'away', 'charger', 'charger', 'drawn', 'watch', 'magnetically', 'leaps', 'connects', 'watch', 'b', 'part', 'happen', 'everyday', 'connection', 'make', 'perfectlythe', 'pw', 'small', 'lighter', 'physically', 'size', 'traditional', 'men', 'mechanical', 'dress', 'watch', 'ancient', 'eye', 'see', 'slightly', 'small', 'screen', 'ease', 'arthritic', 'gorilla', 'finger', 'akso', 'problem', 'manipulating', 'screen', 'comfortable', 'wear', 'long', 'term', 'even', 'bed', 'sleep', 'monitoring', 'offer', 'classy', 'elegant', 'appearance', 'large', 'sporty', 'proi', 'comfortable', 'new', 'user', 'interface', 'within', 'day', 'two', 'think', 'people', 'come', 'another', 'brand', 'wont', 'huge', 'learn', 'curve', 'like', 'pixel', 'smartphones', 'google', 'use', 'simple', 'uncluttered', 'interface', 'find', 'intuitivei', 'quite', 'pleased', 'purchaseand', 'recommend', 'others']",replace age galaxy frontier end life love watch go get either galaxy pro pixel watch much soul search knew make decision gambler decide try something new im glad didnow clearly watch release less month ago go perform one release year ago improvement performance remarkableits faster respond pair quickly easily pixel smartphone superior softwareits really software make smartwatch useful productive samsungs credit keep old war horse software current fitbit software much modern samsung health scan barcode label food package record eat much flexible term nutrient serving list record mean less manual calculation try adjust serving gram say ouncesheart monitoring accurate stair climb much accurate sleep monitoring actually usable might advancement sensor quality rather software algorithms trust result morecharging battery fast get hour life battery minute charge twenty minute charge shower morning give hour battery life wireless magnetic charger little different samsung watch functional user need make sure crown stem parallel power cord watch inch away charger charger drawn watch magnetically leaps connects watch b part happen everyday connection make perfectlythe pw small lighter physically size traditional men mechanical dress watch ancient eye see slightly small screen ease arthritic gorilla finger akso problem manipulating screen comfortable wear long term even bed sleep monitoring offer classy elegant appearance large sporty proi comfortable new user interface within day two think people come another brand wont huge learn curve like pixel smartphones google use simple uncluttered interface find intuitivei quite pleased purchaseand recommend others
Garmin Vívoactive 5,"I decided to order a Garmin Vivoactive 5 when my Fitbit Versa expired on me in Nov.2024.  It took a couple of weeks for it to arrive, mainly due to the holiday season, but it has been worth it.  The battery life on it is much longer than what I previously had on Fitbit, and there are a lot of features available.  It will take a while to familiarize yourself with so many features, but once you do they will be worth it.  If you use it to monitor your workouts, as I do, there are many categories of workouts that it will evaluate, running, walking, strength workouts, biking, cardio, etc.  You get great data on your sleep patterns, morning reports, weather updates, etc.  What I enjoy is that when you download the Garmin app on your phone you can use your data from Garmin to enter into competitions with other Garmin members.  Fitbit, once bought out by Google, began to eliminate a lot of the groups and competitions you could be involved in, so Garmin was a breath of fresh air in this.  The band on the watch feels great and the watch looks stylish.  I am sure that there are a ton more features out there that I have not even gotten to yet, but my impressions on a Garmin smartwatch is that they are definitely worth the money if you enjoy using a smartwatch daily.",5.0,Positive,"['decide', 'order', 'garmin', 'vivoactive', 'fitbit', 'versa', 'expire', 'nov', 'take', 'couple', 'week', 'arrive', 'mainly', 'due', 'holiday', 'season', 'worth', 'battery', 'life', 'much', 'longer', 'previously', 'fitbit', 'lot', 'feature', 'available', 'take', 'familiarize', 'many', 'feature', 'worth', 'use', 'monitor', 'workouts', 'many', 'category', 'workouts', 'evaluate', 'run', 'walk', 'strength', 'workout', 'bike', 'cardio', 'and so on', 'get', 'great', 'data', 'sleep', 'pattern', 'morning', 'report', 'weather', 'update', 'and so on', 'enjoy', 'download', 'garmin', 'application', 'phone', 'use', 'data', 'garmin', 'enter', 'competition', 'garmin', 'member', 'fitbit', 'bought', 'google', 'begin', 'eliminate', 'lot', 'group', 'competition', 'could', 'involve', 'garmin', 'breath', 'fresh', 'air', 'band', 'watch', 'feel', 'great', 'watch', 'look', 'stylish', 'sure', 'ton', 'feature', 'even', 'get', 'yet', 'impression', 'garmin', 'smartwatch', 'definitely', 'worth', 'money', 'enjoy', 'use', 'smartwatch', 'daily']",decide order garmin vivoactive fitbit versa expire nov take couple week arrive mainly due holiday season worth battery life much longer previously fitbit lot feature available take familiarize many feature worth use monitor workouts many category workouts evaluate run walk strength workout bike cardio and so on get great data sleep pattern morning report weather update and so on enjoy download garmin application phone use data garmin enter competition garmin member fitbit bought google begin eliminate lot group competition could involve garmin breath fresh air band watch feel great watch look stylish sure ton feature even get yet impression garmin smartwatch definitely worth money enjoy use smartwatch daily
Garmin Vívoactive 5,"I really like that you can turn the heart rate on or off, gps, on or off etc basically turning all emfs so you can wear it without those harmful effects and only turn them on when working out. The battery life works well and long. My husband and I have the same watch and wear it together. Occasionally his will say he ran a little further (for example mine will say I ran 1 mi while his will say .9 or 1.1) I have noticed the longer distances make the accuracy closer to the same.

Garmin Vívoactive 5,"Four stars out of five - it does a lot of things very well, but lacks some features that I thought it had because of the description on the Garmin web page - most notable the inability to track respiration during workouts.  It does track respiration all day, so this must just be a software issue to get you to buy a more expensive version.  The watch faces are a little finicky to design, but there are a lot of them on the Connect IQ shop (some free, some not).I've worn an A brand watch that works seamlessly with my iPhone since they first came out.  I would say that that watch is an outstanding smart watch with a mediocre fitness tracker.  This Garmin Vivoactive 5 (they now have the 6 released) is an excellent fitness tracker with an average smart watch.  It pairs with the Garmin App and gives you much better granularity into your fitness metrics.  It has a solid battery life - my first test lasted six days before it went into low battery mode and I used it for about 12 hours of workouts (which is a battery drain).  The best feature for me is that it allows me to put all my workouts (including my cycling with a Garmin 1030)  into one location, Garmin Connect.Overall, it isn't a replacement for my smart watch, but it is a great entry level fitness tracker.  I'm planning on using it for several months to completely understand all the features, then I may try going for a high end Garmin watch as a replacement for my trusty A-watch.

Garmin Forerunner 55,"I've had this watch for almost a month and its been fantastic. GPS and heart rate are accurate, display is sharp (albeit not AMOLED level crisp), and the stats are just what I need/want. The question for you is will this watch meet your needs, wants, and lifestyle?With the release of the Forerunner 165, it *seems* the 55 isn't a great choice. The 165 has an AMOLED display, an altimeter, and a few more bells and whistles for about 40 bucks more. The upgraded screen and altimeter make it seem like an easy choice to set down the extra 40 (or 100 for portable music). However, the 55 still offers a nice value and solid features:I've found the display on this watch to be fine (even with so-so near vision). Its already helped me knock time off my pace and train for an upcoming marathon. The data provided by the 55 is detailed:  the body battery, sleep data, VO2 max, fitness age, stress, running cadence, and more are probably a bit more than I want and encompass all that I need. I always run with my phone (as a Zombie's Run fan and need to be in-touch with the outside world) so having a music option or do-it-all watch isn't necessary.While I haven't pulled a formal training plan (I'm following the Zombie's, Run! marathon trainer which I've used before to good effect), I *could* pull a plan to my 55. Further, the 55 ""knows"" when I've gone hard on a run or had a bad night's sleep and recommends a rest day or lower effort run. All good stuff!TL:DR - the 55 is a great option for a beginner runner or experienced runner who wants some data but knows (or is honest with themselves) that they probably won't dive into too deep (e.g. pace, cadence, body battery, and sleep are all they want with a few more goodies). Its also a great choice for the person who wants a dedicated GPS watch but wears other watches during their day and is having trouble justifying a special purpose purchase.I'm still in the return window for my 55 and I'm going to keep it. The 40 dollar (+ tax) isn't a huge hurdle but I can't say that the 165 gives me enough more to turn in the 55. I'm very happy with this watch because *it meets all my needs an wants* if the same is true for  you, go ahead and order this but if you want the sharper display, a bit more data, and an altimeter (really, the only thing I miss on my 55) then save up some more and go that way.",4.0,Positive,"['ive', 'watch', 'almost', 'month', 'fantastic', 'global positioning system', 'heart', 'rate', 'accurate', 'display', 'sharp', 'albeit', 'amoled', 'level', 'crisp', 'stats', 'needwant', 'question', 'watch', 'meet', 'need', 'want', 'lifestylewith', 'release', 'forerunner', 'seem', 'isnt', 'great', 'choice', 'amoled', 'display', 'altimeter', 'bell', 'whistle', 'buck', 'upgrade', 'screen', 'altimeter', 'make', 'seem', 'like', 'easy', 'choice', 'set', 'extra', 'portable', 'music', 'however', 'still', 'offer', 'nice', 'value', 'solid', 'featuresive', 'find', 'display', 'watch', 'fine', 'even', 'near', 'vision', 'already', 'help', 'knock', 'time', 'pace', 'train', 'upcoming', 'marathon', 'data', 'provide', 'detailed', 'body', 'battery', 'sleep', 'data', 'vo', 'max', 'fitness', 'age', 'stress', 'run', 'cadence', 'probably', 'bite', 'want', 'encompass', 'need', 'always', 'run', 'phone', 'zombie', 'run', 'fan', 'need', 'intouch', 'outside', 'world', 'music', 'option', 'doitall', 'watch', 'isnt', 'necessarywhile', 'havent', 'pull', 'formal', 'training', 'plan', 'im', 'follow', 'zombie', 'run', 'marathon', 'trainer', 'ive', 'use', 'good', 'effect', 'could', 'pull', 'plan', 'know', 'ive', 'go', 'hard', 'run', 'bad', 'night', 'sleep', 'recommends', 'rest', 'day', 'low', 'effort', 'run', 'good', 'stufftldr', 'great', 'option', 'beginner', 'runner', 'experience', 'runner', 'want', 'data', 'know', 'honest', 'probably', 'wont', 'dive', 'deep', 'example', 'pace', 'cadence', 'body', 'battery', 'sleep', 'want', 'goody', 'also', 'great', 'choice', 'person', 'want', 'dedicated', 'global positioning system', 'watch', 'wear', 'watch', 'day', 'trouble', 'justify', 'special', 'purpose', 'purchaseim', 'still', 'return', 'window', 'im', 'go', 'keep', 'dollar', 'tax', 'isnt', 'huge', 'hurdle', 'cant', 'say', 'give', 'enough', 'turn', 'im', 'happy', 'watch', 'meet', 'need', 'want', 'true', 'go', 'ahead', 'order', 'want', 'sharp', 'display', 'bit', 'data', 'altimeter', 'really', 'thing', 'miss', 'save', 'go', 'way']",ive watch almost month fantastic global positioning system heart rate accurate display sharp albeit amoled level crisp stats needwant question watch meet need want lifestylewith release forerunner seem isnt great choice amoled display altimeter bell whistle buck upgrade screen altimeter make seem like easy choice set extra portable music however still offer nice value solid featuresive find display watch fine even near vision already help knock time pace train upcoming marathon data provide detailed body battery sleep data vo max fitness age stress run cadence probably bite want encompass need always run phone zombie run fan need intouch outside world music option doitall watch isnt necessarywhile havent pull formal training plan im follow zombie run marathon trainer ive use good effect could pull plan know ive go hard run bad night sleep recommends rest day low effort run good stufftldr great option beginner runner experience runner want data know honest probably wont dive deep example pace cadence body battery sleep want goody also great choice person want dedicated global positioning system watch wear watch day trouble justify special purpose purchaseim still return window im go keep dollar tax isnt huge hurdle cant say give enough turn im happy watch meet need want true go ahead order want sharp display bit data altimeter really thing miss save go way

Garmin Venu 3S Soft Gold,"I got the Garmin Vesu 3s to replace an apple watch to track heart rate after I noticed my apple watch showing out of the norm readings only a year after purchasing. I  never would use a watch for medical advice, but it is nice to be able to note my basic heart rate for my chronic illness. I was advised to try the Garmin because it was built more for athletes and I chose the Vesu 3s because it can do an ECG. I am happy to report that I do like it better than an apple watch! It is slightly larger than the apple watch, which I don't prefer, and the band isn't as nice as the apple watch either, but the watch is more superior in my opinion. I like that the watch face can be customized more than the apple watch and so far it has been pretty spot on with my heart rate (I cross check its data with other methods of tracking heart rate to get a good idea). I am OBSESSED with the fact that it stays charged for so much longer and I can wear it to sleep. Don't love the charging as much. I wish it had a pad it could sit on to charge like an apple watch. It also has a whole host of other health functions to use as well. They give you a USB-C charger and I had to buy a specific converter for it; the chord also isn't long enough and finding a replacement that is longer is something you have to go search for.

Garmin Instinct 2,"I’ve had smart watches I was issued through the military before so that’s nothing new to me. This is therefore a more I formed review. When I got this watch I was pleasantly surprised by ease of use with respect to swapping through the menus and selecting what you need. Does take some time perhaps to memorize where to go for each item but that is to be expected. I mostly wanted this for the GPS with outdoor activity and the heart rate and fitness features. (Fitbit only ever broke after 3 months, that is to say stopped working out of the blue). The compass is on point and the heart rate monitor is spot on as well. One of the coolest things about this is that it connects to an app and you can look for even better watch faces that have exactly what you want to see on them instead of just the default, that’s the kind of support GARMIN gives with this. I got the watch face that displays heart rate, so I don’t have to swap through menus or use the app to see it in real time. The fit is great and the battery life is as well. You should be aware that some features use up more battery than others, such as active GPS etc, so if you use that you can expect the battery to drain a little bit more quickly. The only adjustment I needed to make was the charging cable, I needed to pinch the lip of the plug with needle nose pliers ever so GENTLY just to adjust them the tiniest amount so it seated properly in the watch which is one of the pictures.

Garmin Instinct 2,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but I thought I'd chime in about this. (Just a regular old customer here--no connection to Garmin or Amazon.) My point of view might be uncommon for Garmin owners: I actually don't think of myself as a Smartwatch guy and have actually turned down free Apple Watches (as holiday gifts) on two occasions. No interest in texting on my wrist. I'm a ""watch guy"" in the more traditional sense--a big fan of mid-tier to high-end mechanical watches. But I wanted one techy watch for when I bike and work out and for a long backcountry hike where GPS was going to be necessary. I've owned this watch for a couple months now and have put it through its paces: swimming (it's highly water-resistant), biking, lifting, and (as mentioned) in the wilderness. It hasn't disappointed.Set up is easy and intuitive: if you can handle using an iPhone, you should have no problem making your way through the process. Downloading the smartphone app on your device and syncing it is worth the trouble, in my opinion. Among other things, it will allow you to keep on top of software updates, control your music while working out (without having to touch your phone), and get whatever alerts (like texts or Ring notifications) you might want to opt into. I have it set up so that the Garmin app only seeks out my watch when I open the app---don't want this thing constantly searching and draining my phone battery when I'm not even wearing the watch.I do still fumble through the different buttons trying to remember what does what, but it is getting better. I usually only wear this for a few hours at a time a few days a week; if I wore it more regularly, I'm sure I would be far more fluent by now. And the good news is, you really can't mess anything up by pressing the wrong button.There's tons of customization that you can do (during setup or just whenever) to rearrange the main screen, add or remove activities and options, etc. For an entry-level smartwatch, it's impressively featured!Battery life is utterly insane. I charged it before a 10-hour hike where the GPS was going the entire time--that was in early May. Since then I've worn it several times for many collective hours, sometimes in GPS mode, sometimes not, and I only had to charge it again today--in mid June. Granted, I power it down whenever I'm not using it, but still, you get a lot of time out of a single charge. I have the solar version, and I suppose that extends the battery life in a limited way---can't say I've tested that or noticed strong evidence of it, but I'll take Garmin's word for it.The GPS tracking feature works very well once you get it dialed in to your preferences, which isn't tricky to do. If you get lost, you can flip to the screen where your track is: it's just a squiggly line on the screen---there's no map background on this plain-Jane, smaller, black and white display---but with pretty minimal brainpower, you can use it to retrace your steps, no problem. No chance of getting lost with this thing on, as long as you've got a signal---and I've never had any trouble acquiring one. Beyond that, just having it on your wrist as a trip computer, tracking how long you've been at it, how many miles you've covered, your elevation, etc, is really nice. It allowed me to provide very specific answers every time my kid asked ""how many more miles do we have to go?"" Note, though, that you'll need to activate the GPS mode when you start your hike (or ride or whatever). And you'll want to shut if off when you're done in order to extend the battery life.Nice to have the heart-rate and pulse oximeter features. Also reassuring to have the ""incident reporting"" feature, or whatever it's called. Thankfully haven't had to use it, but I've read positive customer reviews from folks who have. It's a comfort to know that my wife will get an instant alert on her phone if I crash my bike, for example. And I believe the alert will include my exact location.As for the watchy-watch stuff: this thing is very well built. It feels robust, but is as light as a feather. I mean, you can really forget you have it on, especially if you're accustomed to wearing a luxury sports watch that weighs more than 100g. I haven't tried swapping out the rubber strap, but I see no reason why you couldn't put it on a NATO or something if you wanted to. The integrated strap itself feels like it's good quality, though I imagine it will eventually need to be replaced after a few years of putting it on and taking it off.The overall look is very rugged and ""tactical."" At least with the black model, there's nothing refined or luxurious about it at all.The main thing I want to say about it as a watch per se is that the size is perfect, at least for me. A lot of these smartwatches nowadays are enormous: 45mm and super-thick. To me they look absurd. This one is about 40mm, which is by no means small, but it's sensible and while definitely ""sized"" for a man, could work well as an oversized unisex option. Point is, when I'm wearing it, it just feels like a normal watch, proportioned like several of my other, mechanical watches---not like a giant wrist computer. It calls no attention to itself. The screen isn't tiny or anything: the display is plenty readable. It's not touchscreen, it's not full color, you can't watch videos on it---if you want all of that, look at a different model. This is one of those ""everything you need, nothing you don't"" items. (Though, again, it has a pretty surprising array and number of features---most of which I've never used.)Big fan.",5.0,Positive,"['dont', 'write', 'lot', 'review', 'think', 'id', 'chime', 'regular',

Garmin Instinct 2X Solar,"I've been using the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar in Graphite for a while now, and it's been an outstanding experience. This rugged GPS smartwatch has not only met but exceeded my expectations with its solar charging capability, built-in flashlight, and multi-band GNSS support.The solar charging feature is a game-changer. It significantly extends the battery life, ensuring that I rarely have to worry about charging the watch manually. This is incredibly convenient, especially during long hiking trips or outdoor activities where access to power sources is limited. The watch face is designed to maximize exposure to sunlight, efficiently converting it to energy and keeping the watch powered for days on end.Durability is a hallmark of the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar. Its rugged build can withstand all kinds of rough treatment, from bumps and drops to extreme weather conditions. I've used it in heavy rain, on dusty trails, and under the scorching sun, and it has performed flawlessly in every scenario. The graphite color not only looks sleek but also masks dirt and wear, keeping the watch looking new.The built-in flashlight has proven to be more useful than I initially thought. It's powerful enough to guide me through dark paths during night treks and convenient when I need to find something in my backpack after dusk. This feature adds an extra layer of utility, making the watch an indispensable tool for any adventure.As for navigation, the multi-band GNSS support ensures accurate location tracking in even the most challenging environments. Whether I'm in a deep valley, near tall buildings, or under thick canopy, the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar maintains a precise signal, giving me confidence in my location and route.The user interface is intuitive, and syncing with my smartphone is seamless, providing me with notifications, weather updates, and other essential information. The range of activity tracking features is impressive, from standard fitness metrics to specialized outdoor activities, all accurately monitored and recorded.The Garmin Instinct 2X Solar is a top-tier smartwatch that stands out for its solar charging, durability, and precise navigation. It's the perfect companion for anyone who loves the outdoors or needs a reliable timepiece that can handle the rigors of adventure.

Garmin Instinct 2X Solar,"This is the perfect activity watch/smartwatch for me. It can’t call or text from the watch itself, but those are features I rarely used on my Apple Watch anyway. It’ll still show you if you have a text, call, or any other notification but is geared toward being more of a great activity watch than a phone on your wrist.What’s great about this is how jam-packed with features it is. They took a ton of stuff that previously was only available in the fenix and epix watches and brought it to this instinct 2x solar. It has sleep tracking, activity tracking (with customizable screens for each activity), training readiness, heart rate, vo2 max, blood oxygen level, etc.  Most apps charge money for the amount of detail this watch and app give you about your day to day and activities, but there’s no subscription on this. It’s all freeAnd it constantly checks heart rate. My old Apple Watch would check periodically but you could never glance down and see what the current hr was without tapping on the icon and waiting. With this watch it constantly is reading heart rate and keeps a graph showing the history (which you can have show on the watch face if you want).The battery is awesome, something like 40 days with how I have mine set up. And the solar charging actually works. I’ve heard that past versions it didn’t help all too much, but this one it really makes a difference. I added 2 days to my battery life from just a few hours in direct sunlight.The only places where this watch is lesser are the display and the navigation. If detailed maps and touch screen/oled screen are important to you, then go with the fenix or epix models. The navigation on this watch can be useful as it includes the trackback feature where it’ll guide you back on the path you came in on, line-of-sight tracking (keeps you on path if you have to go like down in a valley or around an obstacle where you might lose sense of direction), and you can even pre-load courses to follow later. However, it’s a pretty bare-bones navigation map. It has a pointer for your watch and a line showing the path and that’s about it. The epix and fenix watches have nicer displays, color, touchscreen, and more detailed maps which help a lot with navigation but you also sacrifice a significant amount of battery life for those features. And they’re double the price of this one.All in all, I think this is the perfect middle point for a watch. It has all the features from the top of the line ones that I need, along with crazy battery life and a decent price. If you don’t need detailed navigation but want great gps and activity tracking at half the cost of some of those other watches, this is a great option.",5.0,Positive,"['perfect', 'activity', 'watchsmartwatch', 'cant', 'call', 'text', 'watch', 'feature', 'rarely', 'used', 'apple', 'watch', 'anyway', 'itll', 'still', 'show', 'text', 'call', 'notification', 'gear', 'toward', 'great', 'activity', 'watch', 'phone', 'wristwhats', 'great', 'jampacked', 'feature', 'take', 'ton', 'stuff', 'previously', 'available', 'fenix', 'epix', 'watch', 'bring', 'instinct', 'x', 'solar', 'sleep', 'tracking', 'activity', 'track', 'customizable', 'screen', 'activity', 'training', 'readiness', 'heart', 'rate', 'vo', 'max', 'blood', 'oxygen', 'level', 'and so on', 'application', 'charge', 'money', 'amount', 'detail', 'watch', 'application', 'give', 'day', 'day', 'activity', 'theres', 'subscription', 'freeand', 'constantly', 'check', 'heart', 'rate', 'old', 'apple', 'watch', 'would', 'check', 'periodically', 'could', 'never', 'glance', 'see', 'current', 'hour', 'without', 'tap', 'icon', 'wait', 'watch', 'constantly', 'read', 'heart', 'rate', 'keep', 'graph', 'show', 'history', 'show', 'watch', 'face', 'wantthe', 'battery', 'awesome', 'something', 'like', 'day', 'mine', 'set', 'solar', 'charge', 'actually', 'work', 'ive', 'heard', 'past', 'version', 'didnt', 'help', 'much', 'one', 'really', 'make', 'difference', 'added', 'day', 'battery', 'life', 'hour', 'direct', 'sunlightthe', 'place', 'watch', 'less', 'display', 'navigation', 'detail', 'map', 'touch', 'screenoled', 'screen', 'important', 'go', 'fenix', 'epix', 'model', 'navigation', 'watch', 'useful', 'include', 'trackback', 'feature', 'itll', 'guide', 'back', 'path', 'come', 'lineofsight', 'track', 'keep', 'path', 'go', 'like', 'valley', 'around', 'obstacle', 'might', 'lose', 'sense', 'direction', 'even', 'preload', 'course', 'follow', 'later', 'however', 'pretty', 'barebones', 'navigation', 'map', 'pointer', 'watch', 'line', 'show', 'path', 'thats', 'epix', 'fenix', 'watch', 'nicer', 'display', 'color', 'touchscreen', 'detail', 'map', 'help', 'lot', 'navigation', 'also', 'sacrifice', 'significant', 'amount', 'battery', 'life', 'feature', 'theyre', 'double', 'price', 'oneall', 'think', 'perfect', 'middle', 'point', 'watch', 'feature', 'top', 'line', 'one', 'need', 'along', 'crazy', 'battery', 'life', 'decent', 'price', 'dont', 'need', 'detailed', 'navigation', 'want', 'great', 'global positioning system', 'activity', 'track', 'half', 'cost', 'watch', 'great', 'option']",perfect activity watchsmartwatch cant call text watch feature rarely used apple watch anyway itll still show text call notification gear toward great activity watch phone wristwhats great jampacked feature take ton stuff previously available fenix epix watch bring instinct x solar sleep tracking activity track customizable screen activity training readiness heart rate vo max blood oxygen level and so on application charge money amount detail watch application give day day activity theres subscription freeand constantly check heart rate old apple watch would check periodically could never glance see current hour without tap icon wait watch constantly read heart rate keep graph show history show watch face wantthe battery awesome something like day mine set solar charge actually work ive heard past version didnt help much one really make difference added day battery life hour direct sunlightthe place watch less display navigation detail map touch screenoled screen important go fenix epix model navigation watch useful include trackback feature itll guide back path come lineofsight track keep path go like valley around obstacle might lose sense direction even preload course follow later however pretty barebones navigation map pointer watch line show path thats epix fenix watch nicer display color touchscreen detail map help lot navigation also sacrifice significant amount battery life feature theyre double price oneall think perfect middle point watch feature top line one need along crazy battery life decent price dont need detailed navigation want great global positioning system activity track half cost watch great option
Garmin Instinct 2X Solar,"I got it 100 days ago and have only charged it 5 times. I've used the GPS and activity tracking for about 125 hours, and ran over 135 miles, including 2 spartan races. The band is very durable and lets me tighten it as much as needed to keep most mud out, though the mud during one race did prevent it from tracking my HR properly for about 10 minutes. The watch itself is also durable, and it's activity tracking is as accurate most other Garmin trackers I've used. The GPS is fairly accurate though it does leave the trail by about 3 meters in the foliage (though you can make it more accurate if you want). The solar panel works very well and the battery lasts far longer than I need. The first charge lasted 32 days (charging at 10-20% battery).

Garmin Epix Pro,"As a long time Garmin user I must say this Epix 51mm is amazing. I've owned the Fenix 3HR, 6X and 7X. All were fantastic watches in their own ways. I always wanted the 51mm size in AMOLED, and now the Epix offers that.  The battery life is simply amazing and in smart watch mode, I get longer life than my 7X. The screen is AMAZING much like an Apple Watch or Samsung watch.  This is NOT a smart watch in the sense of Apple or Samsung. This is a fitness/outdoor watch. You're not going to make phone calls, watch videos etc on this watch. This is geared for folks who value health metrics. Overall, I'd say this watch is the best Garmin has to offer.  The new HR appears better than the older generation. It's able to lock on and read HR during strength training workouts. The older models struggled in that area like most wrist based HRM. Steady state cardio workouts, the HRM is spot on! It's an expensive watch, but worth every penny in my opinion.

Garmin Epix Pro,"Really an amazing piece of machinery. Huge battery, built in flashlight (that I use pretty regularly), tons of info and even apps at your fingertips.Two things it does NOT have: 1. microphone / speaker: you cannot make or receive phone calls, and it cannot make any sound.

I'm too big and old to run like that, so it doesn't measure my VO2max.

That said, it succeeded in tracking most of my movement skiing in a blizzard, so not bad!But here's the thing: two years old, the battery life is down to 6 days with no exercise.

Garmin Forerunner 265,"What you have on your wrist is a phenomenal computer with 100's of thousands of man hours in the writing of code and algorithms to take all the data from the sensors and turn it into a comprehensive health guide for physical fitness.  And Garmin, along wth Polar and Apple and Suunto and all the other lesser known brands, have barely scratched the surface of the possibilities to harness computing power on your wrist.  They haven't even begun to tie in AI to take the data and give you your own personal narrative for how to optimize your health and fitness.  One could write a book on all the potential for this technology in this field.But as to the implementation...The menus need some work...Garmin Connect, where one can build an app and upload it to the watch to run weight lifting routines or HIIT exercises needs a very lot of work.  It works but it's crude and basic.  For instance, if you want to track HRR [Heart Rate Recovery] after an excercise you have to remember to hit stop immediately, hit the lower right button to gain access to a set of options and then scroll to track HRR over the next two minutes.  All the while you are losing heart beats to count.  Really?  Why isn't that option in the GC app maker so you can add it to the app you are building?  And why, when you do a repetitive set that has work-rest and you repeat that x number of times do they insist on ending with a rest period.  The last period should be a work period.  And why can't the tie their lame audio beeps to your phone where you can customize the sounds you want to hear when doing a HIIT routine, eg?But, for all my grousing, I love being able to track my sleep and quality of sleep, my HR, HRV, time to recover, quality of the workout, time in HR Zones, Anaerobic and Aerobic quality, Body Battery, Stress, Intensity minutes, Training Status, Training Readiness, etc.  Too many things to mention.  And I've just scratched the surface in learning how to use it over these last 5 months.  I'm really excited about how they will integrate AI into this journey.  I would love to have an AI bundled with the watch that I could talk to through my phone.

Garmin Fēnix 8,"I had the fenix 3 and loved it, but the screen was impossible to read most of the time.  This was a major problem for me and probably most users.  I then switched to a apple watch.  I really liked the easy of use, but felt that the tracking of activities was not that detailed and the battery life completely sucked.  I purched my second apple watch and had it just over a  year and went swimming with it.  It asked to track and open water swim and I said yes.  It then died from getting wet.  At that point, I was done with apple and was looking for something that was more dependable and had a long battery life.  Every did a ton of research and found that most of watches work well, but almost none have all the features I was looking for (long battery life, looks good, bright display, customized watch face, detailed tracking of activities, durable, water proof and compatible with IOS.  There were few that did all of these and found that I really liked the look of the fenix 8 AMOLED.  I have had it about 3 weeks and love it.  There is a little bit of a learning curve with the menu and trying to find were some of the things are.  Also depending on the activities, depends on what you need to do.  Like with lifting, it will track weight, reps and set you do.  Which is really nice.  Also, with some of the activities it will track your actual movement on a map.  I did softball and did not hit that well, so it showed most of my movement from home to first.  Golf is also nice, because you can track your score, Get distance to pin, a map of the hole/hazards and if you get the subscription you can play virtual rounds.  I also found that the garmin gps was more accurate then the course gps.  Battery life is so nice and the watch looks great too.  With the always on feature and tracking everything, I get around 11-15 days between each charge.  IWatch I would have to charge mid day to handle a full day of activities.  With the Garmin, it will also track my sleep/rest whic is something that I did not get because of battery life with the IWatch.

Garmin Fēnix 8,"I really wanted this watch to be the one that finally helped me move away from the Polar strap I’ve been using for years.Overall this is a beautiful watch.  Once you learn all the buttons and functions, it’s truly amazing.  That being said, I seriously question its accuracy…especially for $12001.  It consistently says my resting heart rate is in the 90s.  Occasionally it would show 70s which is a significant difference.  My OH1 strap usually has me in the 60s2.  Sleep score and stage measurements are off.  My typical sleep pattern almost always has me waking up in the middle of the night and up for about an hour before I fall back asleep again.  The “awake” measure was NEVER accurate.  For example:  I was up last night for ~40 min and it shows I was awake for 17 min. This makes me question whether or not it’s accurately measuring the other stages.Otherwise, the watch is beautiful and was a tough thing to give up.

Garmin Vívosmart 5,"Was always an avid Fitbit 5 user but the quality of Fitbit has declined. I have gone through two in the past two years. So far the positives on the Vivosmart 5 (cost comparable) are the all-in-one protective band, sleek design (a little bit narrower than the Fitbit 5). The functions are impressive, accurate and limitless but not simple to use. Initial set-up is a breeze, step by step on the band and app but there are no instructions after that so plan on spending some time getting to know your Vivosmart 5, don’t get frustrated it may take 4 or 5 days but once you figure it out your going to love it, I do. Some functions will not appear for a couple of days as data must be gathered to generate results. Biggest draw back is no found logging. They work in conjunction with My Fitness Pal, which wants you to pay premium to use almost any of their features, yuck and the syncing between the two is not great, so there is never a accurate breakdown of calories in/out without bouncing back and forth between the apps.

Battery life is a week or more unless you have features like full time pulse ox or other power hungry features turned on.The main issue with it is that the sleep tracking is more limited and less reliable than the next model up (vivoactive 5) and there are currently some problems with the “body battery” feature unless they can fix the firmware.In particular, it doesn’t do “nap tracking” but then again the nap tracking even on more expensive models is currently rather inaccurate with things like sitting in a recliner reading while awake being detected as a “nap”.Basically this is the model you want if you just need the essential features of a fitness/health tracker, don’t want to be paying for subscriptions, and don’t need stuff like ConnectIQ apps (most of which aren’t that useful).

Garmin Epix Gen 2,"I've owned several Garmin watches over the last few years, starting with the  The main reason that I purchased this watch, starting with the first Instinct, and then up to the Fenix 6.  They all had impressive battery life and ruggedness that the Samsung and Iwatch don't. As my eyes age though, the screen on the other Garmin watches was difficult to read in low light, and you had to push a button to use the backlight.  The Epix fixes all that for me.  The large OLED screen is bright enough to see in any light, and with a flick of the wrist, the screen wakes up.  Though the touchscreen works well, old habits die hard and I tend to use the physical buttons more than the screen. They work exactly the same as the Fenix. The usual suite of Garmin software and apps makes it a useful ecosystem to be in.  The fitness tracking appears to be accurate, and while the sleep tracking may not be, it does seem consistent for me at least.  I don't generally use the built-in mapping, because I usually have my phone and it drains the battery quickly, but the times I have used it, the maps look great and track properly. There are tons of watch faces to help customize as well.  The bands are the same as the Fenix watches (not sure about the 8) so there are plenty of replacements on Amazon.  And they are the easiest bands to change out as well.  The battery is usually about 2 weeks at most, which is sufficient for me; it charges quickly and though it's not a month, it will do.  The one complaint I would have is the charger itself.  I dislike proprietary chargers, only in that I have to have an extra cable in my bag that already has plenty of extra cables.

Garmin Epix Gen 2,"I had a Fenix and sold it to purchase an Apple Watch Ultra which I still have and enjoy using. However, while the AWU is a great smartwatch and has far better interaction, notification and connection to other Apple devices the AWU has horrendous batter life and it's fitness tracking is not as good as Garmin. Both watches have their place and I'll keep the AWU as it does have it's place.Regarding the Epix G2, the amoled screen is excellent, bright vibrant color, works well enough in direct sun and still, even with AOD enabled allows for multi-week battery. Compared to a day and a half on the AWU this is amazing. Workout tracking, step tracking and mapping are great and work as well as the AWU. Also I prefer that the Epix is round, watches should be round. Once the weather gets better I am looking forward to comparing the Epix G2 to my Garmin Edge 1000, if the EG2 works well enough as a cycling computer I'll likely sell the Edge as I don't need two cycling computers.Overall I'm very happy with the watch, it does many things excellent, some things good.

Garmin Enduro 3,"The Garmin Enduro is a significant upgrade from the Fenix 6 Sapphire. The primary issue I had with the Fenix was its limited battery life, which the Enduro addresses remarkably well. I can now enjoy nearly 3 weeks of consistent heavy usage, compared to the 3 days I had with the Fenix 6S. This improvement eliminates the frustration of starting a workout only to find my watch running low on juice.The Enduro 3 also introduces several new features that enhance the user experience. Training Readiness and Endurance Score, both absent from the Fenix 6, are particularly useful for me. I can now assess my training readiness and plan my workouts accordingly, or opt for a rest day if the analytics tell me that a rest day would be more beneficial. Additionally, the sleep tracking on the Enduro 3 seems more refined and accurate.Despite its larger size (10mm more), I find the Enduro 3 lighter than my old Fenix. However, I don’t mind the extra bulk since it offers more features and improves the solar charging capability over the Garmin watches with smaller faces. A notable difference to the Fenix 8 (which I looked at closely before choosing the Enduro) is that the  Enduro 3 lacks voice features. But, as currently implemented, I consider the voice feature a gimmick that I would rarely use. I would only consider voice functionality if Garmin integrated a cellular connection and call-making capabilities, but that hasn’t been announced for the Fenix line.  Hopefully, that is something they are considering adding since I’d like to do workouts near my home without dragging along my cell phone.Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with the latest version of the Enduro by Garmin. While it may be larger, its lightweight design and exceptional battery life make it an ideal choice for my need of a no-frills fitness tracker with remarkable battery life.

Garmin Enduro 3,"I've had a Fenix 3, a Fenix 5, a Bulova Precisionist, a Citizen Eco-Drive, a high-end ProTrek, and two Apple Watches in the last several years.  In a way, the Apple Watches were way ahead of everyone else, in that they can do EVERYTHING.  At the same time, though, the Apples were a little fragile, and are tightly tethered to being recharged.  The Eco-Drive and the ProTrek had the advantage of solar power, which allows them to keep going when the power is out for extended periods, including cataclysms of various sorts, but they didn't do very many things, including no heart rate.I don't remember now why I sold the Fenix 5, but I remember being impressed with its durable construction, its multiplied resources for exercise and outdoor use, plus amazing battery life.  Garmin has been working on solar power for several years, now, and the new Enduro 3 maximizes battery life plus it has the same software and capabilities of the Fenix 8--with the exception of a MIP screen instead of AMOLED, no speaker or microphone, and no diving capabilities (though it is waterproof to 10 ATM).  Some reviewers say the Enduro 3 is the best watch Garmin has ever made.I encourage you to check the specs on the Enduro 3.  It really is quite remarkable.  It's light, and easy to wear all the time.  It's G-Shock quality, with sapphire glass and all the bells and whistles of Garmin's latest OS.  It would be nice to have the glitter of AMOLED, but those screens eat batteries, and battery life was my central criterion.  I also wanted a digital watch, not an analog one, and satellite nav with good maps.  Check.The Garmin store can't be compared to Apple's for add-ons, but I have found the Falcon Z and the BIG EASY watch faces to provide all the customization I really need.

Garmin Fēnix 7,"I bought this watch to replace my Samsung Galaxy 4 watch.The battery life is enormous. With normal use, it'll last maybe 2-3 weeks. I'm not that active of a person. I'm actually probably not the audience this watch is geared towards but I got it anyways bc I wanted a smart watch that would have a charge lasting more than a day.It does exactly what I want, lasts more than a day. Nice big display.I don't like that the display isn't super bright. However, I actually bought the Forerunner 965 to try out. The interfaces were almost the same, except the Forerunner was more beautiful. When I move my hand to look at the time though, bc the Fenix is a MIP display, it is truly always on. I can at least see it. The forerunner though would be off, sometimes wouldn't turn on unless I wiggles my wrist a smidge. It's something little, I know.But, for my needs (I work in a hospital, sometimes get blood or other patient biohazardous fluids on it during procedures), it works great. I can wash it very very thoroughly. If it can survive 5ATM of pressure it can definitely handle a thorough cleaning.The band that came with it is nice. I usually losen it one or two notches overnight. The sleep tracking, which is not the primary purpose of the watch, is pretty good. I think my old Fitbit Charge 3 was more accurate for sleep timings than Samsung Galaxy 4.... And that was more accurate than the Fenix. But overall, good enough for my needs. It doesn't keep track of naps though. Supposedly there is an update coming soon to fix that.The brightness could be better BUT in direct sunlight I can definitely read it.The built in flashlight is clutch. I love that feature. I don't remember the Forerunner 965 having it but I tried both simultaneously for a week and might have just forgotten.Location is extremely accurate for me. No issues. I only used it near my house. Primarily to track my location to send to wife in case of medical emergencies while walking. Very very happy with it.Again, my use case is slightly different than the typical for the audience this is meant for. I'm not a health fanatic. Just an average person. I walk maybe 2-3 miles a day. I don't go on mountain trails that often. I don't go biking.

Garmin Fēnix 7,"Purchased this watch to replace a dying Garmin Vivoactive 3. Having some gift card monies to spend, I really wanted a Fenix even though I knew it was much more watch than I really needed.  As usual, I over researched watches (reviews, YouTube videos, etc) but narrowed my search to the Fenix 7x Pro and the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  Although the Apple Watch is a great watch, ultimately it didn’t meet my needs as much as the Garmin.As mentioned before, the Fenix exceeds my needs but what I’ve experienced thus far, I know I made the correct choice. Naturally because it is a much more advanced watch than my outgoing Vivoactive, the features are more accurate. GPS is spot on, HR is surprisingly good, stairs counter is much more accurate, and the rep counter when strength training is much better.  I’ve been using the sleep tracker…I really don’t know the accuracy of the feature but it’s interesting all the same. I anticipate using the map features while hiking/biking once the weather improves.  I probably don’t need to mention battery life but this watch is probably second to none. I’m going from charging every other day to going several weeks on a charge.A concern of mine was the case size of the watch. My Vivoactive was 42mm (I believe) and this Fenix is 51mm. A couple coworkers have Apple Watch Ultra 2’s and I thought the size was reasonable at 49mm. Still not certain, I went to a local store that carries Garmin watches and tried on a Fenix 8 at 51mm. My decision was made after that.  It is a big jump in watch size but I was able to accustom myself to the watch very quickly. Being a larger case, all the provided data can be viewed easily instead of being smushed onto a smaller screen.My one an only dislike of the watch is the watch band.

Garmin Fēnix 7,"I purchased this watch back in November 2024, mainly for its super accurate heart rate monitoring, especially given my history of V-tach and my implanted ICD. I was particularly interested in its newly added ECG capabilities, and in regards to obtaining an accurate heart beat readings per minute during exercise.I primarily use it for walking and swimming. For walking, the tracked distance is accurate, as is the GPS. I particularly like the lap tracking, which is based on distance, pace, and other metrics.For swimming, I used it this past week in my pool, and it accurately captured the time and distance swum. An added benefit was its resistance to seawater—specifically, the Dead Sea, where the salinity is extremely high. I was in the water for 20 minutes then came out and rinsed it well with fresh water. It resumed working like a charm. One thing to note about using the watch in sea water: it is highly advisable not to press any of the side buttons while under water.I love this watch and will most likely upgrade to future models as needed.",5.0,Positive,"['purchase', 'watch', 'back', 'november', 'mainly', 'super', 'accurate', 'heart', 'rate', 'monitoring', 'especially', 'give', 'history', 'vtach', 'implant', 'icd', 'particularly', 'interested', 'newly', 'add', 'ecg', 'capability', 'regard', 'obtain', 'accurate', 'heart', 'beat', 'reading', 'per', 'minute', 'exercisei', 'primarily', 'use', 'walk', 'swim', 'walk', 'tracked', 'distance', 'accurate', 'global positioning system', 'particularly', 'like', 'lap', 'track', 'base', 'distance', 'pace', 'metricsfor', 'swimming', 'use', 'past', 'week', 'pool', 'accurately', 'capture', 'time', 'distance', 'swum', 'add', 'benefit', 'resistance', 'seawaterspecifically', 'dead', 'sea', 'salinity', 'extremely', 'high', 'water', 'minute', 'come', 'rinse', 'well', 'fresh', 'water', 'resume', 'work', 'like', 'charm', 'one', 'thing', 'note', 'use', 'watch', 'sea', 'water', 'highly', 'advisable', 'press', 'side', 'button', 'wateri', 'love', 'watch', 'likely', 'upgrade', 'future', 'model', 'need']",purchase watch back november mainly super accurate heart rate monitoring especially give history vtach implant icd particularly interested newly add ecg capability regard obtain accurate heart beat reading per minute exercisei primarily use walk swim walk tracked distance accurate global positioning system particularly like lap track base distance pace metricsfor swimming use past week pool accurately capture time distance swum add benefit resistance seawaterspecifically dead sea salinity extremely high water minute come rinse well fresh water resume work like charm one thing note use watch sea water highly advisable press side button wateri love watch likely upgrade future model need

Garmin Approach R50,"Had to return it as I tried to work with Garmin Support to figure out why and was getting no where.For lower iron shots it was not bad.  Actually, SW, GW and PW it calculated distance out a bit longer than reality.Mid irons was pretty much spot on.Where it suffered the most was long clubs like Driver & 3W.. and a little bit with other longer clubs - but not as bad as the driver.Was having to swing like a gorilla to get 225 at best.  So not sure if it was just a bad unit or not, but was not getting the right feedback from the support team.  Ball speed on the 225 was at 140 mph.  Which is really not possible.  And yes, there are many other factors too, but when you take into account a 10 degree launch angle - most all other factors still don't equate to 225 total distance.One really positive note - never missed a ball I hit with the 3 camera system.  Was very solid there.When I intentionally wants to go left to right or right to left, it picked that up well too.  Shanks to fat, etc..  all pretty solid.Has a camera system that allows you to play this back on the screen so you can see the ball impact from the club.This is a sticker system, them you get stickers to put on the top middle of each club to help with club head speed.One really solid feature is that you do NOT need a computer in order to hook this up to a projector - comes with it's own HDMI port.This product has a LOT of promise!  It's kinda a one of a kind product in the space right now.  You'll see a lot of GREAT reviews of it.  And I'm sure most of them are solid/legit reviews.  But I had to report my frustration and findings just to be fair.  After all, if you want to play golf using the Garmin Golf SUBSCRIPTION plan you need to get (99 a year or around 20 bucks a month) you want to be able to get off the tee further than 200 to 225 yards or otherwise you're in for a very long day.Btw, one other thing I did not like was the resolution and the practice round treatment.  I want a launch monitor that shows a crisp clean ball flight away from the ground up and this did not give me that.  It really should be much higher resolution.Now the amount of data points you get is very impressive.  Along with the camera view of ball impact, as well, this picks up all ball contacts and even putting - yes, putting works here too.Btw, Home Tee Hero (Garmin Subscription Required and you get over 43k of courses) you don't put, you have two circles one that covers the outside of the green which is you hit in that you get 2 strokes putting (gimme) and a smaller circle that gets you 1 stroke putting (gimme).",2.0,Negative,"['return', 'try', 'work', 'garmin', 'support', 'figure', 'get', 'wherefor', 'low', 'iron', 'shot', 'bad', 'actually', 'sw', 'gw', 'pw', 'calculate', 'distance', 'bit', 'longer', 'realitymid', 'iron', 'pretty', 'much', 'spot', 'onwhere', 'suffer', 'long', 'club', 'like', 'driver', 'w', 'little', 'bit', 'longer', 'club', 'bad', 'driverwas', 'swing', 'like', 'gorilla', 'get', 'best', 'sure', 'bad', 'unit', 'get', 'right', 'feedback', 'support', 'team', 'ball', 'speed', 'miles per hour', 'really', 'possible', 'yes', 'many', 'factor', 'take', 'account', 'degree', 'launch', 'angle', 'factor', 'still', 'dont', 'equate', 'total', 'distanceone', 'really', 'positive', 'note', 'never', 'miss', 'ball', 'hit', 'camera', 'system', 'solid', 'therewhen', 'intentionally', 'want', 'go', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'left', 'pick', 'well', 'shank', 'fat', 'and so on', 'pretty', 'solidhas', 'camera', 'system', 'allow', 'play', 'back', 'screen', 'see', 'ball', 'impact', 'clubthis', 'sticker', 'system', 'get', 'sticker', 'put', 'top', 'middle', 'club', 'help', 'club', 'head', 'speedone', 'really', 'solid', 'feature', 'need', 'computer', 'order', 'hook', 'projector', 'come', 'hdmi', 'portthis', 'product', 'lot', 'promise', 'kinda', 'one', 'kind', 'product', 'space', 'right', 'youll', 'see', 'lot', 'great', 'review', 'im', 'sure', 'solidlegit', 'review', 'report', 'frustration', 'finding', 'fair', 'want', 'play', 'golf', 'use', 'garmin', 'golf', 'subscription', 'plan', 'need', 'get', 'year', 'around', 'buck', 'month', 'want', 'able', 'get', 'tee', 'yard', 'otherwise', 'youre', 'long', 'daybtw', 'one', 'thing', 'like', 'resolution', 'practice', 'round', 'treatment', 'want', 'launch', 'monitor', 'show', 'crisp', 'clean', 'ball', 'flight', 'away', 'ground', 'give', 'really', 'much', 'high', 'resolutionnow', 'amount', 'data', 'point', 'get', 'impressive', 'along', 'camera', 'view', 'ball', 'impact', 'well', 'pick', 'ball', 'contact', 'even', 'put', 'yes', 'put', 'work', 'toobtw', 'home', 'tee', 'hero', 'garmin', 'subscription', 'require', 'get', 'k', 'course', 'dont', 'put', 'two', 'circle', 'one', 'cover', 'outside', 'green', 'hit', 'get', 'stroke', 'put', 'gim', 'small', 'circle', 'get', 'stroke', 'put', 'gim']",return try work garmin support figure get wherefor low iron shot bad actually sw gw pw calculate distance bit longer realitymid iron pretty much spot onwhere suffer long club like driver w little bit longer club bad driverwas swing like gorilla get best sure bad unit get right feedback support team ball speed miles per hour really possible yes many factor take account degree launch angle factor still dont equate total distanceone really positive note never miss ball hit camera system solid therewhen intentionally want go left right right left pick well shank fat and so on pretty solidhas camera system allow play back screen see ball impact clubthis sticker system get sticker put top middle club help club head speedone really solid feature need computer order hook projector come hdmi portthis product lot promise kinda one kind product space right youll see lot great review im sure solidlegit review report frustration finding fair want play golf use garmin golf subscription plan need get year around buck month want able get tee yard otherwise youre long daybtw one thing like resolution practice round treatment want launch monitor show crisp clean ball flight away ground give really much high resolutionnow amount data point get impressive along camera view ball impact well pick ball contact even put yes put work toobtw home tee hero garmin subscription require get k course dont put two circle one cover outside green hit get stroke put gim small circle get stroke put gim

Garmin Forerunner 970,"This watch is awesome for the things it is capable to do for a runner, such as myself.I've moved on from a Samsung Watch 5(Samsung fan), to this and I have not been disappointed!I'd say it is pretty pricy, and this is my first time ever owning such a watch. I had picked this(2nd best) over Garmin's Fenix 8 (Their top watch), due to me not really wanting to pay a little extra for the extra features such as the Solar Charging or Longer battery life, because I don't mind charging my watch ever so often and I am not outside THAT much for it to make a difference. At least 2 hours at most for my training. The watch will last me a long enough (~10 to 14days) without charging and I am happy with that versus me having to charge my Samsung watch like 1.5x a day which was getting annoying. The quality of the watch is amazing, the Glass is supposed to be stronger than the Gorilla kind and the material of the bezel makes it look so premium. The charging speed is also pretty good, I don't realize how fast it charges but I know it's quick (~1hr) from 0 to 100.The sensors it has seems pretty good and capable of tracking my daily results.

Garmin Forerunner 970,"I really like how light and comfortable the 970 is compared to Enduro and Fenix watches. It's also very full-featured. 5-day battery life with AOD is okay, and it charges quickly. (15 days without AOD.)The AMOLED display looks great indoors in medium-to-bright light, and outdoors if it's overcast. In active mode, it's okay-not-great in bright sunlight. Both active and AOD can be a bit too bright in the dark. The one real fault here is that the AOD practically disappears in bright sunlight.The touchscreen is extremely overly sensitive at times. A slight accidental brush of the screen with my sleeve can start rearranging my glance widgets! Sometimes it's so hypersensitive I just have to disable the touch screen for a bit. Everything is fine with the touch screen disabled. This is the biggest flaw, and I hope it can be fixed with software updates. I used the Enduro 3 for a few weeks and its touch screen was just fine, not hyperactive like the 970.Aside from the glitchy touch screen and the AOD that's invisible in bright sunlight, I like the 970 and am keeping it.

Garmin Forerunner 55,"I love Garmin and this 55 forerunner is awesome. It's great for any sport. You can add or remove activity options. There's a nice size bank to choose from. It holds a lot of health info. I can monitor my period on it, stress, sleep, activity, etc. one of the things I like is, it can detect when you go for a walk or a run or a ride and logs it, even if you forget to log the activity. It also lasts long. I've had it for more than a year. You can set what notifications get sent to the watch (which apps can do that). It has even training coaches that you can utilize for different sports. You can join different challenges from different sports. It also holds a charge for over a week mostly. Typically 10 days and if you're not that active, even closer to two+ weeks.

Garmin Forerunner 55,"I needed a heart rate monitor but saw how many more features this watch had over a fitbit, so for the same or less than the larger fitbit,  I bought the renewed version of the 55.  I loved it - for 1 day.  Then I immediately realized I needed something newer and more to really get the most out of the potential for all of the apps  The 55 is: too dim, needs the backlight on or activated all the time, battery lasted like, 4 days running with display, running breathing apps, etc. it has small fonts and icons that make it hard to see, (like the watch hands overlap the heart rate if you have that screen enabled - the overall diameter of the screen is just too small), and limited extra apps that the newer Garmin fleet has and diminished functionality of parallel apps.I returned with the 90 day refund policy and upgraded to the 165.  Now I really, really love what I've got.My opinion if it helps: if you are strapped and can only get the 55, get it. But, trust me, you will return it and get at least a 165 if you have the extra $120 (ish).  I debated over getting the 255, but, after reading the reviews (Tom's) and looking at the screen shots, really, if you are used to a smart phone at all, you will want the 165 with the AMOLED over the MIP of the 55 and 255.  The touch screen on the 165 also makes navigating through the deeper menus much easier as does turning on the display if the accelerometer doesn't activate it as needed. Of course any model higher is going to rock and roll.  I don't mind the mix of hard buttons and screen swipes.  I think it's a good combo.Too early to comment on battery life, but, so far, I like the watch enough, I honestly don't care if I can get 3 days out of it.  Def way less ""fanboy"" than an apple watch.  All reviews say it's much more geared to fitness as well.

Garmin Fenix 5S Plus,"I am sixty-nine year old person who likes to work out.  I bought this watch after a year of research deciding that for my uses a reconditioned watch suited my needs and budget.  Is this watch perfect, no it isn't, but I love recording my workouts and checking my results.  The watch pushes me beyond my already tendency to be obsessive.  It is also very accommodating telling me my fitness age, which i am sure is off a bit, but I can dream it is accurate.I think the map when I am hiking on the watch is too small to be really useful so I use the Gaia app instead which is great.  The watch also pleasantly adds 25 meters to my swim workout which i appreciate, though I know better.The adjusted steps that the watch sets as a goal can be annoying as sometimes you simply want to relax.  As far as the battery, if you are not going backpacking, the battery has not had a problem lasting the day even while recording multiple activities, usually no more than three though...isn't retirement nice.For all these critical elements that I have written about they are insignificant to me.  I am  not goings to the Olympics so my training does not need to be honed to split seconds. The reconditioned watch is extremely reasonable for what it does.

Garmin Swim 2,"This watch replaced a Garmin Venu Square that stopped charging. Since this watch is more expensive I picked up the 3-year warranty on this one.Pros: Simple to use. Outside rim of the watch protects the bezel nicely. Looks good. Accurate GPS built in. HR monitor matches well with built-in HR in exercise equipment. Looks pretty good for a fitness tracker.Cons: Only one Cardio option. Pricier than the more flexible Venu Square. Can't customize display for fitness use. No Walk event tracking.I have been sticking with Garmin because I need accurate HR monitoring in the water, and most trackers disable their HR on swim functions. These seem to do a good job with that, and if you are an avid swimmer this would be a great watch for you. It has swim tracking and logging functions that I don't use, so I can't speak to those.With this watch being so much more expensive, you don't need your smartphone for the GPS to function, but I'm a little disappointed that there's only one, generic Cardio event for tracking. Otherwise there's Pool Swim, Open Water Swim, Cycling, and Running. I suppose you could use the Running Event to track a walk or hike.Wish List: Break Cardio event into a variety of events only distinguished by there name, for more easy history analysis in the Garmin Connect app. I would like to customize what's shown on the display screens during a recording event. For instance, when swimming I want to see distance, elapsed time and HR on the main screen. Instead, all you can see is the interval distance and time, with unused space at the bottom.So, all that being said, I like this watch. While there are some things I wish it would do, generally speaking it just works. I like not having to mess with a screen protector like I've had to with my earlier, raised bezel models. If you don't mind that, always have your smart phone on you, and need more flexibility, check out the Venu Square, but get the protection plan!",5.0,Positive,"['watch', 'replace', 'garmin', 'venu', 'square', 'stop', 'charge', 'since', 'watch', 'expensive', 'pick', 'year', 'warranty', 'onepros', 'simple', 'use', 'outside', 'rim', 'watch', 'protect', 'bezel', 'nicely', 'look', 'good', 'accurate', 'global positioning system', 'build', 'hour', 'monitor', 'match', 'well', 'builtin', 'hour', 'exercise', 'equipment', 'look', 'pretty', 'good', 'fitness', 'trackercons', 'one', 'cardio', 'option', 'pricier', 'flexible', 'venu', 'square', 'cant', 'customize', 'display', 'fitness', 'use', 'walk', 'event', 'trackingi', 'stick', 'garmin', 'need', 'accurate', 'hour', 'monitoring', 'water', 'tracker', 'disable', 'hour', 'swim', 'function', 'seem', 'good', 'job', 'avid', 'swimmer', 'would', 'great', 'watch', 'swim', 'track', 'log', 'function', 'dont', 'use', 'cant', 'speak', 'thosewith', 'watch', 'much', 'expensive', 'dont', 'need', 'smartphone', 'global positioning system', 'function', 'im', 'little', 'disappointed', 'there', 'one', 'generic', 'cardio', 'event', 'track', 'otherwise', 'theres', 'pool', 'swim', 'open', 'water', 'swim', 'cycle', 'run', 'suppose', 'could', 'use', 'run', 'event', 'track', 'walk', 'hikewish', 'list', 'break', 'cardio', 'event', 'variety', 'event', 'distinguish', 'name', 'easy', 'history', 'analysis', 'garmin', 'connect', 'application', 'would', 'like', 'customize', 'whats', 'show', 'display', 'screen', 'record', 'event', 'instance', 'swimming', 'want', 'see', 'distance', 'elapse', 'time', 'hour', 'main', 'screen', 'instead', 'see', 'interval', 'distance', 'time', 'unused', 'space', 'bottomso', 'say', 'like', 'watch', 'thing', 'wish', 'would', 'generally', 'speak', 'work', 'like', 'mess', 'screen', 'protector', 'like', 'ive', 'early', 'raise', 'bezel', 'model', 'dont', 'mind', 'always', 'smart', 'phone', 'need', 'flexibility', 'check', 'venu', 'square', 'get', 'protection', 'plan']",watch replace garmin venu square stop charge since watch expensive pick year warranty onepros simple use outside rim watch protect bezel nicely look good accurate global positioning system build hour monitor match well builtin hour exercise equipment look pretty good fitness trackercons one cardio option pricier flexible venu square cant customize display fitness use walk event trackingi stick garmin need accurate hour monitoring water tracker disable hour swim function seem good job avid swimmer would great watch swim track log function dont use cant speak thosewith watch much expensive dont need smartphone global positioning system function im little disappointed there one generic cardio event track otherwise theres pool swim open water swim cycle run suppose could use run event track walk hikewish list break cardio event variety event distinguish name easy history analysis garmin connect application would like customize whats show display screen record event instance swimming want see distance elapse time hour main screen instead see interval distance time unused space bottomso say like watch thing wish would generally speak work like mess screen protector like ive early raise bezel model dont mind always smart phone need flexibility check venu square get protection plan
Garmin Swim 2,"Update 16June2022: I just want to give a shout out for Garmin phone support. I was having trouble getting GPS to find satellites this summer, and it was losing track mid swim.  Mary Beth at Gamin support walked me through several paths to finally get the find time down to under a minute. She was patient and seemed genuinely interested in solving my problem -- a rare event from support lines these days. I'm still loving my Swim 2 after nearly a year.------- original review --------------My earlier Garmin Forerunner 310XT wrist GPS takes forever to achieve satellite lock, and it showed me zipping back and forth while I was open-water swimming, so I needed something new. It's all in the software, because a watch on your wrist will lose a satellite or two while it's under water, and the software needs to adjust for this and not think you have zoomed at high speed to the point where it regains satellite lock. Garmin has been working on this issue for some years, (as have others) and I'm very pleased with the results.I also borrowed an Apple watch for a few open-water swims. Tracking was excellent, but it has a feature that locks out any screen actions while swimming, making it somewhat difficult to control. Also, the Garmin is really built for swimming, so it has many more swimming metrics besides speed that make tracking your progress easier. The other advantage is that the Swim 2 software interface is very smooth on a PC, whereas you have to interact with an Apple watch with an iPad, Mac, etc. (There may be options for the interface that I'm not aware of.)The real killer for my use of the Apple watch was that it was less reliable reading my pulse while swimming. Both Apple and Garmin use optical pulse measurement, which is a bit dicey in the water (both say to adjust the band tight but comfortable), but often I would finish a swim to find that the Apple watch had not recorded my pulse at all. The Garmin may make some mistakes occasionally, but it keeps doing the best it can.Controlling the Garmin is not as intuitive as the Apple watch, but once I got used to it I didn't start activities unintentionally or make similar mistakes too often.On balance, the Garmin Swim 2 is a keeper and has replaced my Timex Triathlon as my main watch. The alarm, timer, and stopwatch features are more flexible than the old Timex and get a lot of use.",5.0,Positive,"['update', 'june', 'want', 'give', 'shout', 'garmin', 'phone', 'support', 'trouble', 'get', 'global positioning system', 'find', 'satellites', 'summer', 'lose', 'track', 'mid', 'swim', 'mary', 'beth', 'gamin', 'support', 'walk', 'several', 'path', 'finally', 'get', 'find', 'time', 'minute', 'patient', 'seem', 'genuinely', 'interested', 'solve', 'problem', 'rare', 'event', 'support', 'line', 'day', 'im', 'still', 'love', 'swim', 'nearly', 'year', 'original', 'review', 'earlier', 'garmin', 'forerunner', 'xt', 'wrist', 'global positioning system', 'take', 'forever', 'achieve', 'satellite', 'lock', 'show', 'zip', 'back', 'forth', 'openwater', 'swim', 'need', 'something', 'new', 'software', 'watch', 'wrist', 'lose', 'satellite', 'two', 'water', 'software', 'need', 'adjust', 'think', 'zoom', 'high', 'speed', 'point', 'regain', 'satellite', 'lock', 'garmin', 'work', 'issue', 'year', 'others', 'im', 'pleased', 'resultsi', 'also', 'borrow', 'apple', 'watch', 'openwater', 'swim', 'track', 'excellent', 'feature', 'lock', 'screen', 'action', 'swim', 'make', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'control', 'also', 'garmin', 'really', 'build', 'swim', 'many', 'swim', 'metric', 'besides', 'speed', 'make', 'track', 'progress', 'easy', 'advantage', 'swim', 'software', 'interface', 'smooth', 'pc', 'whereas', 'interact', 'apple', 'watch', 'ipad', 'mac', 'and so on', 'may', 'option', 'interface', 'im', 'aware', 'ofthe', 'real', 'killer', 'use', 'apple', 'watch', 'less', 'reliable', 'reading', 'pulse', 'swimming', 'apple', 'garmin', 'use', 'optical', 'pulse', 'measurement', 'bit', 'dicey', 'water', 'say', 'adjust', 'band', 'tight', 'comfortable', 'often', 'would', 'finish', 'swim', 'find', 'apple', 'watch', 'record', 'pulse', 'garmin', 'may', 'make', 'mistake', 'occasionally', 'keep', 'best', 'cancontrolling', 'garmin', 'intuitive', 'apple', 'watch', 'get', 'use', 'didnt', 'start', 'activity', 'unintentionally', 'make', 'similar', 'mistake', 'oftenon', 'balance', 'garmin', 'swim', 'keeper', 'replace', 'timex', 'triathlon', 'main', 'watch', 'alarm', 'timer', 'stopwatch', 'feature', 'flexible', 'old', 'timex', 'get', 'lot', 'use']",update june want give shout garmin phone support trouble get global positioning system find satellites summer lose track mid swim mary beth gamin support walk several path finally get find time minute patient seem genuinely interested solve problem rare event support line day im still love swim nearly year original review earlier garmin forerunner xt wrist global positioning system take forever achieve satellite lock show zip back forth openwater swim need something new software watch wrist lose satellite two water software need adjust think zoom high speed point regain satellite lock garmin work issue year others im pleased resultsi also borrow apple watch openwater swim track excellent feature lock screen action swim make somewhat difficult control also garmin really build swim many swim metric besides speed make track progress easy advantage swim software interface smooth pc whereas interact apple watch ipad mac and so on may option interface im aware ofthe real killer use apple watch less reliable reading pulse swimming apple garmin use optical pulse measurement bit dicey water say adjust band tight comfortable often would finish swim find apple watch record pulse garmin may make mistake occasionally keep best cancontrolling garmin intuitive apple watch get use didnt start activity unintentionally make similar mistake oftenon balance garmin swim keeper replace timex triathlon main watch alarm timer stopwatch feature flexible old timex get lot use
Garmin Swim 2,"I have worn the watch for a week.  There are many things I like about it, including the app.  However, after digging around the Garmin website, I realized that the watch and app do not automatically record pool swims when the lap time is over 1 minute 30 seconds for a 50 meter lap.  I am a senior and my best lap times for 50 yards are around 1 minute 40 seconds, which would yield a 1:54 50 meters.  Therefore, the hour-long swim does not auto register.  I have to add it to the app manually after the swim.  If I use the pool swim function on the watch at the beginning of the swim, it registers correctly.  Maybe everyone else knows about the speed issue, but I don't recall seeing it in the watch description or even in the app documention, without digging down several layers.  As mentioned in other reviews, it also does not register walks, other than steps.  I use the bike function on the watch to record my walk times, distance and routes.

Huawei Watch Gt 5,"I’ve tried several smartwatches—Garmin, Amazfit—but the HUAWEI GT5 stands out as the one I truly love. From the moment I put it on, the comfort, style, and intuitive interface made it feel like it belonged on my wrist.

I just don't see where other reviewers are having issues. The watch is awesome and the battery lasts a surprisingly long time compared to other watches I've tried.The only thing I recommend is, when you register everything, make sure to say you are in a different country besides the USA.

Huawei Watch Fit 3,"I have been wearing this watch for a full week and can honestly say this is way better than my older Apple Watch.  My Apple Watch 3 was going on 5 yrs old and was no longer holding a charge for more than 6 hours. I wanted a new smart watch but was hesitant to shell out $400 for a new Apple 10.  After a lot of research I decided to try the Huawei Fit 3 but I was concerned there were few reviews posted from a US based user.  So here’s my take on this interesting watch:Pros:  1.  Amazing battery life.  After first full week of daily usage, battery was at 33%.  Let’s see an Apple Watch match that.  2.  Seamless connection with my Apple 14 phone.  Leave the Health app open on your phone and it works perfectly.  I took a 2 mile walk with my new and old watches shortly after getting the Huawei, and both tracked the same exact distance .  3.  History of your exercise and health records tracks closely with those used by Apple.  Looks a bit different from Apple but the data is there.  4.  The watch face I have posted a photo of is great- it provides me with all the data I want on a smart watch on one screen- steps, bpm, weather, time,  date, battery life and  even Sp02.  5.  Price- I paid $155 for this watch and to me, this is a way better value than a $400 Apple 10.  6.  Accessories.  I purchased watch face covers and bands specific to the Fit 3 and they are interchangeable just like my old Apple 3.Cons:  No way to control your music or podcasts from the Huawei watch like you can on an Apple Watch.  For some folks, I can see why this could be a deal breaker, but not for me.I hope this review helps anyone considering this watch in the US.  After 1 full week, I have no regrets opting for the Huawei Fit 3 over other watches made by Apple, Garmin and Fitbit.

Huawei Watch Ultimate Smartwatches,"First of all, the watch by itself looks gorgeous.  They could have been amazing in terms of functionality. But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label.

Huawei Watch Gt 4,I have been an Apple person since the early 2010s and have had 3 Apple Watches. My last one was about 5 years old and the battery was terrible - I literally had to charge it throughout the day just to get through. My boyfriend and I got each other this watch for Christmas and they were easy to set up. So far the battery life is awesome. Day 2 and I’m still at 83%. My phone notifications - text and calls come through fine. I never really replied to text on my watch so I just use my phone. I think for the money the value is awesome - so much cheaper than an Apple Watch and has all of the same qualities! The screen size is big but very clear and super comfortable to wear. So far I am very happy! Now I have only had for 2 days so I will come back to update but so far so so happy with the purchase!,5.0,Positive,"['apple', 'person', 'since', 'early', 'apple', 'watch', 'last', 'one', 'year', 'old', 'battery', 'terrible', 'literally', 'charge', 'throughout', 'day', 'get', 'boyfriend', 'get', 'watch', 'christmas', 'easy', 'set', 'far', 'battery', 'life', 'awesome', 'day', 'im', 'still', 'phone', 'notification', 'text', 'call', 'come', 'fine', 'never', 'really', 'replied', 'text', 'watch', 'use', 'phone', 'think', 'money', 'value', 'awesome', 'much', 'cheap', 'apple', 'watch', 'quality', 'screen', 'size', 'big', 'clear', 'super', 'comfortable', 'wear', 'far', 'happy', 'day', 'come', 'back', 'update', 'far', 'happy', 'purchase']",apple person since early apple watch last one year old battery terrible literally charge throughout day get boyfriend get watch christmas easy set far battery life awesome day im still phone notification text call come fine never really replied text watch use phone think money value awesome much cheap apple watch quality screen size big clear super comfortable wear far happy day come back update far happy purchase

Huawei Watch Gt 5,"Ordering was easy but returning is impossible. The watch was too expensive for the quality. It would not connect to my phone , the strap was too large and uncomfortably odd with the  ceramic coating, the face was hard to read and a lot smaller than expected.

There are no instructions and what little there is does not reflect on the phone  and the watch lost power very quickly while trying to get it set up when it was stated that it has a battery life of 7 days. I only got 45 minutes.The pictures of the watch made it look way more elegant than it does in person.  The ceramic watch band looks strange and feels cold on the skin.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"My Galaxy (4) watch was ready for an upgrade!I always do my research and read the reviews before I buy a product. This purchase was no different. I was somewhat concerned with a number of reviewers complaining that the battery was not good and didn't last long. So, I want to address that concern first.With all of my watches I never use the Always on Display function. I realize that the watch faces are beautiful on the Galaxy Screen. However, those beautiful bright LED's use power. If you leave them on all the time you can expect maximum battery drain. I have everything turned on except the AOD. Yesterday I used my watch a lot as I was playing and experimenting with all the cool features. Wore it through the night to monitor my sleep. This morning at 6 a.m. I had used a total of 27 percent of battery power for a 24 hour period! At this rate of power usage I can expect 3+ days of use. Battery life doesn't concern me at all.SETUP (Stars*****)I was expecting to make a trip to my service provider because I use the LTE version. I figured I could do all the setup minus the phone provider portion at home. I was extremely impressed with the setup/switch procedure. Simple, straight forward and quick!I was pleased at how simple and easy the setup was. As soon as I was done I needed to let my dogs out for a walk. While I was out walking the girls my Watch rang! I answered it and had a nice conversation. The switch feature swapped over and set up all of my LTE functions without the need to spend half a day at my phone providers location!DIGITAL RING VERSUS PHYSICAL (Stars *****)I never really liked the physical ring all that much. The new digital ring is awesome! Good job Samsung!CHARGING (Stars *****)Charges extremely fast with the little charger that comes with the watch. This small charger is great for travel. I ordered a couple more.FITNESS (Stars *****)I'm still using them and can only say that so far they are still the award winning excersize App/sensors they have always been.AI (Stars *****)Wow! This opens up a whole new experience with my watch. I use Alexa to do so many things now. The ability to put Alexa on my watch is a real game changer. Don't worry, if you prefer Google assistant you can use that as well.ASTHETICS (Stars *****)I think Samsung could have done a better job with the advertisement pics out there. I was initially disappointed at how the Galaxy 7 looked. When I actually got the watch I happily realized the pics don't do it justice. I think that this is the most aesthetically pleasing watch Samsung has made to date.THE BAND (Stars ***)Nope. I knew I didn't like the watch band it comes with from the pics. If you want an extra you can have mine. I ordered a watch band from Wingle to match the silver of the watch. Wow! They are a perfect match and look gorgeous!I couldn't be happier! What a great Smartwatch. When you pair this watch with the Samsung family of devices it is in a class of it's own!OVERALL: Five Stars!RECOMMEND?: Absolutely YES!",5.0,Positive,"['galaxy', 'watch', 'ready', 'upgradei', 'always', 'research', 'read', 'review', 'buy', 'product', 'purchase', 'different', 'somewhat', 'concerned', 'number', 'reviewer', 'complain', 'battery', 'good', 'didnt', 'last', 'long', 'want', 'address', 'concern', 'firstwith', 'watch', 'never', 'use', 'always', 'display', 'function', 'realize', 'watch', 'face', 'beautiful', 'galaxy', 'screen', 'however', 'beautiful', 'bright', 'led', 'use', 'power', 'leave', 'time', 'expect', 'maximum', 'battery', 'drain', 'everything', 'turn', 'except', 'aod', 'yesterday', 'use', 'watch', 'lot', 'play', 'experiment', 'cool', 'feature', 'wear', 'night', 'monitor', 'sleep', 'morning', 'use', 'total', 'percent', 'battery', 'power', 'hour', 'period', 'rate', 'power', 'usage', 'expect', 'day', 'use', 'battery', 'life', 'doesnt', 'concern', 'allsetup', 'starsi', 'expect', 'make', 'trip', 'service', 'provider', 'use', 'lte', 'version', 'figure', 'could', 'setup', 'minus', 'phone', 'provider', 'portion', 'home', 'extremely', 'impressed', 'setupswitch', 'procedure', 'simple', 'straight', 'forward', 'quicki', 'pleased', 'simple', 'easy', 'setup', 'soon', 'do', 'need', 'let', 'dog', 'walk', 'walk', 'girl', 'watch', 'rang', 'answer', 'nice', 'conversation', 'switch', 'feature', 'swap', 'set', 'lte', 'function', 'without', 'need', 'spend', 'half', 'day', 'phone', 'provider', 'locationdigital', 'ring', 'versus', 'physical', 'star', 'never', 'really', 'liked', 'physical', 'ring', 'much', 'new', 'digital', 'ring', 'awesome', 'good', 'job', 'samsungcharging', 'star', 'charge', 'extremely', 'fast', 'little', 'charger', 'come', 'watch', 'small', 'charger', 'great', 'travel', 'order', 'couple', 'morefitness', 'star', 'im', 'still', 'use', 'say', 'far', 'still', 'award', 'win', 'excersize', 'appsensors', 'always', 'beenai', 'star', 'wow', 'open', 'whole', 'new', 'experience', 'watch', 'use', 'alexa', 'many', 'thing', 'ability', 'put', 'alexa', 'watch', 'real', 'game', 'changer', 'dont', 'worry', 'prefer', 'google', 'assistant', 'use', 'wellasthetics', 'star', 'think', 'samsung', 'could', 'do', 'well', 'job', 'advertisement', 'pic', 'initially', 'disappointed', 'galaxy', 'look', 'actually', 'get', 'watch', 'happily', 'realize', 'pic', 'dont', 'justice', 'think', 'aesthetically', 'please', 'watch', 'samsung', 'make', 'datethe', 'band', 'star', 'nope', 'know', 'didnt', 'like', 'watch', 'band', 'come', 'pic', 'want', 'extra', 'mine', 'order', 'watch', 'band', 'wingle', 'match', 'silver', 'watch', 'wow', 'perfect', 'match', 'look', 'gorgeousi', 'couldnt', 'happier', 'great', 'smartwatch', 'pair', 'watch', 'samsung', 'family', 'device', 'class', 'ownoverall', 'five', 'starsrecommend', 'absolutely', 'yes']",galaxy watch ready upgradei always research read review buy product purchase different somewhat concerned number reviewer complain battery good didnt last long want address concern firstwith watch never use always display function realize watch face beautiful galaxy screen however beautiful bright led use power leave time expect maximum battery drain everything turn except aod yesterday use watch lot play experiment cool feature wear night monitor sleep morning use total percent battery power hour period rate power usage expect day use battery life doesnt concern allsetup starsi expect make trip service provider use lte version figure could setup minus phone provider portion home extremely impressed setupswitch procedure simple straight forward quicki pleased simple easy setup soon do need let dog walk walk girl watch rang answer nice conversation switch feature swap set lte function without need spend half day phone provider locationdigital ring versus physical star never really liked physical ring much new digital ring awesome good job samsungcharging star charge extremely fast little charger come watch small charger great travel order couple morefitness star im still use say far still award win excersize appsensors always beenai star wow open whole new experience watch use alexa many thing ability put alexa watch real game changer dont worry prefer google assistant use wellasthetics star think samsung could do well job advertisement pic initially disappointed galaxy look actually get watch happily realize pic dont justice think aesthetically please watch samsung make datethe band star nope know didnt like watch band come pic want extra mine order watch band wingle match silver watch wow perfect match look gorgeousi couldnt happier great smartwatch pair watch samsung family device class ownoverall five starsrecommend absolutely yes
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"I've been using the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 for a couple of weeks now, and I can confidently say it's the best smartwatch I've ever owned.Right out of the box, the design is sleek and premium—it feels comfortable on the wrist and looks great whether I’m at the gym or in a meeting. The display is incredibly sharp and bright, even in direct sunlight. I would suggest purchasing a cheap pack of screen protectors to avoid screen cracking, since it's a touch-based device.Performance-wise, it’s lightning fast. Apps open instantly, navigation is smooth, and the new health features are next-level. I especially love the updated body composition metrics and the improved sleep tracking. The watch gives genuinely useful health insights, not just generic data.Battery life has also impressed me. I’m easily getting over a full day on a single charge, even with all-day heart rate monitoring, GPS workouts, and notifications turned on. And speaking of workouts, the auto-detect feature for exercises is surprisingly accurate.If you're on the fence, don’t be.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"I’ve been using the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Bespoke Edition for a few weeks now, and I must say, this smartwatch truly stands out in terms of both style and functionality. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or someone looking to improve your health and fitness, this watch has something for everyone.Design and Build: A Stylish StatementThe Bespoke Edition of the Galaxy Watch 7 comes with a customizable design, and I absolutely love the ability to personalize the watch to match my style. The 44mm model offers a great balance between a larger screen for better readability and a comfortable fit. The sleek, premium stainless-steel frame and high-quality finish are top-notch, and the customizable straps add a personal touch—there’s something for every occasion, whether you’re working out or heading to a formal event.The display is sharp, bright, and vibrant with the AMOLED screen, even in direct sunlight. It’s not just functional but truly a piece of wearable art.Performance and Features: Smarter Than EverThe Galaxy Watch 7 runs on a smooth, responsive interface, powered by Samsung’s Tizen OS, which provides seamless integration with both Android and iOS devices. Notifications, messages, and alerts come through cleanly and quickly. The new AI-powered Energy Score feature is a real standout, offering insights into your daily energy expenditure and recovery, helping you optimize your activities for better overall wellness. It’s a fantastic feature for anyone focused on maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle.Battery life is impressive, lasting around 2 days with moderate use, and the wireless charging is fast and convenient. I can easily go through a full day of workouts, notifications, and sleep tracking without worrying about running out of juice.Health & Fitness Tracking: Comprehensive and AccurateSamsung’s health and fitness tracking capabilities on the Galaxy Watch 7 are excellent. It tracks a wide range of activities, from running and cycling to yoga and strength training, and offers detailed insights on heart rate, calories burned, and even advanced metrics like VO2 max. The built-in GPS is accurate for outdoor workouts, and I’ve found the heart rate sensor to be incredibly precise during both intense workouts and calmer activities like walking or stretching.One of the most useful features is the Energy Score. It uses AI and real-time data to provide a daily ""score"" based on your physical activity, sleep patterns, and recovery time. This is a game-changer if you’re looking to optimize your fitness routine or get a better understanding of your overall energy balance throughout the day.Sleep tracking is another area where the Galaxy Watch 7 excels. It offers detailed insights into sleep cycles (light, deep, REM) and provides suggestions for improving sleep quality, which I found helpful for maintaining my overall well-being.Smart Features and Connectivity: Seamless IntegrationThe Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and the ability to take calls directly from the watch without needing to reach for your phone is incredibly convenient. You can also stream music via Spotify or store offline playlists for runs or workouts without having to carry your phone. The built-in Bixby voice assistant works well, though I found it to be a little slower than on my phone. That said, it’s great for quick commands or hands-free tasks.The watch supports NFC for Samsung Pay, making it easy to tap and pay when I’m on the go—super convenient for those times when I forget my wallet or phone.Final Thoughts: The Smartwatch to BeatOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Bespoke Edition 44mm Bluetooth AI Smartwatch with Energy Score is an exceptional wearable that blends high-end design with advanced health and fitness tracking. The customizable look is perfect for anyone who wants a watch that’s as much a fashion accessory as a fitness tool, and the AI-powered insights, especially the Energy Score, make it one of the most intuitive and effective smartwatches I’ve used.Whether you’re looking to boost your workouts, improve your sleep, or just have a stylish smartwatch that keeps you connected, the Galaxy Watch 7 Bespoke Edition delivers it all.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"Works well with samsung/android ecosystem.

Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"I have owned the Galaxy watch Ultra for about a month now. From someone who has, and still wears, an Apple Watch ultra 1 also. I can say that they both, for me, do exactly what I want. The Galaxy however, to me personally, is the better looker and is less buggy. I have not had to shut it down because of any freezing, or glitches. It has tracked my workouts great, and the battery is really good. However, I don't believe the battery life is better than my apple watch, but close. I am an active person, so my watch gets used much. I recommend the galaxy watch ultra to anyone who is on the fence about getting one. If you don't mind big watches, and you track your runs, calories, and any workouts, I don't see you going wrong by picking one up.

Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"The Ultimate Smartwatch Experience!I recently got my hands on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47mm LTE AI Smartwatch, and I have to say, it’s an absolute game-changer! From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by the attention to detail and premium build quality. The titanium frame and sapphire crystal display not only look stunning but also feel incredibly durable, giving me confidence that this watch can handle anything I throw at it.The 47mm AMOLED display is nothing short of spectacular. It’s bright, sharp, and responsive, making it easy to read notifications, track fitness stats, and navigate apps even in direct sunlight. The customizable watch faces are a fantastic touch, allowing me to switch from a sporty look during workouts to something more professional for the office. The LTE connectivity is a standout feature for me—I can leave my phone behind and still make calls, send texts, stream music, and even use GPS navigation seamlessly. It’s perfect for runs, hikes, or even just quick errands without being tied to my phone.When it comes to health and fitness tracking, the AI-powered sensors are incredibly accurate and insightful. The heart rate monitoring, SpO2 sensor, advanced sleep analysis, and ECG capabilities make it feel like having a personal health assistant on my wrist. I love the detailed workout modes that adapt based on my activities, providing real-time feedback and post-workout analysis that helps me track progress effectively. The GPS is also impressively accurate, which is a must for my outdoor runs and cycling sessions.Battery life was a pleasant surprise, considering all the features packed into this watch. I can easily get two full days of use with LTE, GPS, and continuous health monitoring enabled. When I do need to recharge, the fast-charging feature gets me back to full power quickly, which is a huge plus for someone constantly on the move.Another aspect I appreciate is the integration with Samsung’s ecosystem. Syncing with my Galaxy phone was seamless, and I love the ability to control smart home devices directly from my wrist. The voice assistant is responsive and accurate, making tasks like setting reminders, controlling music, or checking the weather effortless.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47mm LTE AI Smartwatch is everything I could ask for and more. It combines a sleek design, powerful performance, and comprehensive health tracking into one impressive package.

Switching between workouts is seamless—thanks to Wear OS and the Quick Button, I can set up multi‑sport tracking (like triathlons) and GPS is impressively accurate with dual‑frequency support.On top of that, the new Galaxy AI insights give real-time feedback on my sleep, recovery, and energy levels—no subscription needed .

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"What I Liked:I’ve had prior experience with tech refurb work through T-Mobile, so I tend to keep my expectations in check with Amazon Renewed products, but this one genuinely impressed me. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic I received was near mint, cosmetically flawless, and has been running perfectly after several weeks of daily use.I was expecting to see some telltale signs of refurb wear like battery drain, slow charging, or connectivity issues.. I’ve experienced none of that. Battery life is solid, the LTE and Bluetooth connections are stable, and everything works exactly as intended.The rotating bezel is easily one of the best parts of the experience—responsive, smooth, and satisfying to use. The watch is comfortable on the wrist and packed with features like HR zones, sleep tracking, and health insights that all seem to function without hiccups. I actually liked it so much I bought one for my wife too. it hasn’t left her wrist since.What Could Be Better:The OEM watch band is the weakest part of the setup. It gets the job done, but it feels cheap and lacks comfort. I'd recommend upgrading to a quality aftermarket band to really round out the experience.Bottom Line:For a renewed device, this exceeded all expectations. Near-new condition, reliable function, and all the smart features working as advertised. If you’re on the fence about buying this renewed, don’t be.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Upgrading to the 47 mm Galaxy Watch 6 Classic felt like switching from a studio apartment to a penthouse suite. The larger Super AMOLED display offers generous real estate for maps, workouts, and quick replies while looking absolutely sharp under bright California sun. The physical rotating bezel returns as the crown jewel, giving precise, tactile control that never smudges the screen.Performance is snappy thanks to Samsung’s newest Exynos W930 chipset paired with 2 GB of RAM, so apps launch instantly and tiles scroll without stutter. Battery life stretches to a full 40 hours even with always-on display and frequent heart-rate checks. A quick thirty-minute top-up on the included fast charger easily carries me through the next day.Health features are where the watch earns its keep. The upgraded BioActive sensor suite delivers reliable ECG, blood pressure, and body-composition readings, plus it finally nails automatic workout detection for strength training. Sleep Insights 2.0 offers actionable tips rather than generic “sleep more” advice, and the new skin-temperature tracking adds an extra layer for wellness monitoring.Build quality feels premium. Stainless steel housing, sapphire crystal, and IP68 plus MIL-STD-810H durability mean I can move from paddle-boarding to a client meeting without swapping devices. Paired with One UI Watch 5 on Wear OS 4, the watch plays nicely with both Android and Google services, so I can reply to texts, tap to pay, and navigate Spotify playlists with equal ease.At around four hundred dollars, the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic 47 mm positions itself as a flagship smartwatch that actually acts like one.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"My thrid Samsung watch after taking 5 year break from them. Has mostly same great features, just enhanced. I got the blue tooth version this time, need to stay somewhat close to your phone to talk. Great phone and function though and very light weight so wearing all night isn't a problem. The 43mm version is perfect size for my wrists and not wanting a clunky watch. These kind of amazing products and great prices are why I've stuck with Samsung and Android since we left the Blackberry keyboard days. I love the watch, and screen covers are easy to find but you can dive in this watch, or swim in a pool with it everyday like I do. So glad I got it, because 2 days later I was able to take a surprise call while my hands were full. I would have missed the call could have been quite costly.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"The watch is great! I only took a star away because I think the charger and band are crap. The band wasn't in good condition and actually broke apart a few times which made my new watch fall to the ground.

I had also purchased new bands ( I didn't have them yet when it fell) and a charging station for both my phone and watch. Now that I have all the pieces together, I love it! The watch itself though is in great condition and so far working perfectly! Battery life is way different than the galaxy 4 I had before.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Just a great watch. I love how for 40 bux you can change the face to your tast for the day all year. If you spend this much money, at least get Facer or in my opinion you've wasted your money,  cause the faces is where it's at for me. I was certain I didn't need the lte but would have gotten it for sure if I knew than what I know now. I have no regrets just would have gotten it. I love the black, but sort of wish I would have gone with silver cause of the bands you can buy. It's a very good feeling watch nice and heavy.Change the band immediately unless you like to live in discomfort and protect the bezel not the screen. Trust me and if you insist on screen protector the inner are you will put it on is like bevel or cone shaped so if the glass isn't you'll regret it 🤭 add tons of music and pictures easy to use and change. Turn your notifications sound to vibrate and minimal sounds or when it gets to updates you'll be a very noisy fellow. And turn your screen to AOD and only push button to wake. Battery is good but not for the first month when it's figuring out your usage patterns I wish you can adjust the speed with your bezel turn you have to turn it like one whole rotation to scroll like 3/4"" of page and also the direction. For some reason I'd rather turn it the other direction. Watch is a 5/5 still but dont expect it to be miraculous.

Great option if you have a small wrist like me, this size of the screen is a great fit for petite wrists along with your ""average wrist"".

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"really wanted to keep this watch as the 40 mm size was perfect and loved the features.My use case was very simple, using it as a stand alone cycling fitness tracker that syncs to Strava fitness app.  I wanted it to record my miles ridden with gps and also leave my phone at home and still be able to make phone calls in case of emergency. Everything was working fine even though the miles tracked with gps were about a tenth of a mile off from my phone for every ten miles ridden. I could tell from the gps map of my ride using both the watch and the phone that my phone was able to track more accurately. There was less variability in the gps signal.Ok, so I could live with gps being off by a mile over a 100 mile bike ride.I was also comfortable with the battery life. Seemed like I could get a good 7hours or more using cellular, gps tracking, and data service. The rest of my day I didn't even wear the watch.The deal breaker for me was the lack of external heart rate monitor support.Shocker!  I have seen reviews saying how the heart rate tracking for the samsungs weren't that good and I had an external polar heart rate monitor I wanted to use. Well, I could not do that. I could not get my motorola phone to recognize the HR Monitor via bluetooth. I researched some and found some people had luck getting it to work with a little effort but only with a Samsung phone. Mine was a motorola.Sorry, but I need an external hr sensor so that was the deal breaker since I know the google pixel watch and the apple watches support that.If you're not picky like me and can live with the less accurate heart rate tracking built  into the watch then it's a great device and probably the best android based watch.

Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"I've had a 4 Classic since 2021 and there's enough to like about it that I haven't seen a watch I'd rather have. The battery life is the biggest downside. You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit.

Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"I'm very much enjoying this watch.  I refuse to spend much money on a watch, so when this went on sale at a bargain price, I went for it.  I came from an Amazfit that was starting to annoy my by refusing to do alerts.  This Samsung watch is a couple of generations old and is refurbished.  I cannot tell that is isn't brand new, and everything works well.  I have a Samsung phone, so using the Samsung Wear app and syncing to the watch was super easy.  Battery life is great - I'm at 75% after using it all day (no way am I going to be wanting to sleep with a watch on!).  The step count is accurate.  Setting what apps to alert was easy.

Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"I can't believe I was able to get a decent Samsung smart watch for so cheap, refurbished or not. I actually really like this. My previous smart watch was a Samsung, so I knew basic stuff about how to/what to. The watch did come with a quick start guide and a charger, both very nice to have. It has all the same bells and whistles I was used to, plus more. I actually used the flashlight feature last night while my tiny was sleeping so I could move around without turning a light on, and that worked great. The battery isn't too bad for my purposes. I got 2 days out of it, but I tracked steps and sleep only. I did blood oxygen, and that depleted my battery pretty quick, but I just wanted to see what it was like. Neat feature, but not one I need. Anyway, it's on par with what my non-refurbished old watch used to get, so I'm very happy about that.The battery was dead when it arrived, but I got it charging and used my phone to do most of my set-up while it juiced. The other nice thing was a lot of my stuff transferred from my old watch to the new, so I didn't have to add back my alarms and stuff. That was swell. I also like that the watch can do sound alarms, and they're not super annoying or obtrusive.All-in-all, good watch. Happy I took a chance on the refurbished. And the size is just perfect for me, too.I did manage to scratch it already (I just got it this past weekish), but I have a toddler and I'm a klutz, so that's probably my doing anyway.I would like to suggest NEVER taking it swimming, or even in the shower, even though there's tracking for swimming and a ""water lock"".

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch 5 (40mm Bluetooth Smartwatch), and overall, I’m quite impressed. Here are the things I love about it:Intuitive Setup: Getting started was straightforward, from installing apps to connecting and creating accounts. Everything synced seamlessly.Tracking: While my primary goal was to track physical activity, I was pleasantly surprised by its sleep monitoring feature. It not only tracks my sleep patterns but also offers tips to improve consistency, which is incredibly helpful.Personalization: It’s easy to change watch faces or swap out bands, making it adaptable to any style or situation.Automatic Activity Recognition: The watch impressively tracks my activities automatically, even when I forget to set up a workout. Whether I’m walking, rowing, following a workout video, or simply tidying up around the house, it picks up my movements accurately without manual input.Convenient Alarm Syncing: I also love how it syncs with my phone alarm. As autumn settles in here in Illinois, mornings can be dark, and alarms are easy to miss. The watch vibrates along with my phone alarm, making it harder to ignore and ensuring I get up on time.What Could Be Improved:Blood Pressure Tracking: While this isn’t Samsung’s fault, I wish the US allowed blood pressure monitoring on this device. I have another watch from Temu with this feature, and it’s incredibly useful for seeing trends and understanding how different events impact my stress levels. It encourages me to manage stress more effectively rather than compartmentalize it.Battery Life: The battery longevity is a bit disappointing. I primarily use the watch for fitness, sleep tracking, and basic functions like stress measurement. Given my moderate usage, I expected the battery to last longer between charges, but I find myself needing to recharge it at least daily - as frequently as my phone.Final Thoughts: Despite these minor drawbacks, the Galaxy Watch 5 is well worth the investment. It’s reliable, versatile, and convenient, and I believe it will last a long time.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"I was hesitant to write this review because I was planning on returning the watch due to the heinous software consistency but for some reason they are allowed to put a longer return window on the Amazon return date than they actually accept. So now I am stuck with this piece of junk. That being said it is more than deserving of a one star review. If you like watches that one major feature upgrade than their counterparts but the feature absolutely does not work accurately or give you the option to check it 90% of the time I would like to introduce you to the skin temperature feature on this watch. Some how the most basic features for a smart watch is also incredibly unreliable and unavailable most of the time, this would be the heart rate monitor. Oh and I hope you like connectivity issues because that is all you are going to get with this. In the first 2 months of trying this product out it got disconnected from my phone 4 times and took days to reconnect. ( I have an android) sure this thing counts your steps but it counts a different amount then the feature my phone already includes so now I have to wonder which one is wrong. And beware the ""WiFi battery saving feature"" for some reason since the device would die much faster if it was constantly using WiFi it only uses WiFi when prompted to through specific settings/user interaction. But if course if we are having connectivity issues with everything else how surprising is it that this junky watch can't decide whether it should actually preform it's automatic setting tasks because it is capable of consistently reconnecting to the WiFi then updating these apps or tracking widgets... What ever, literally don't even try streaming anything Spotify and audiobooks that aren't downloaded are never going to consistently play for more than 2 mins. But don't worry you also won't have enough space to download music or books or too many apps, even though every app seems to need a second widget or app to operate on the watch...  Honestly not even sure how this watch is very usable it's like having a disappointment strapped to your wrist at all times.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"Really happy with this Samsung-compatible smartwatch. It arrived in excellent condition, no scratches or damage, and came with a charger. It was boxed with a plastic sleeve instead of padding, but it still arrived safely and looked brand new. Great packaging for a refurbished smartwatch.🔧 Setup ExperienceThe watch powered on immediately, but setup wasn’t completely intuitive. I had to look up how to turn it on (which button or buttons to push, etc) to get started and navigate a few steps before things felt familiar. That said, if you’ve used Samsung products before, it’s pretty smooth from there.A quick start guide would’ve helped for initial setup. Not a dealbreaker, but something to keep in mind if you're new to smartwatches.🔋 Smartwatch Battery LifeBattery performance was excellent. I charged it in the afternoon, didn’t charge overnight, and by morning it was still at 75%. It also charges very fast. For a budget-friendly smartwatch, that’s better than I expected. Definitely solid smartwatch battery life for the price range.📱 Easy PairingConnected to my Samsung phone without a hitch via Bluetooth. Pairing was fast, and once I was past setup, everything worked smoothly. Notifications, features, and tracking all synced properly.🧾 No Receipt IncludedThere was no printed receipt or paperwork in the box. Might not matter to everyone, but worth noting if you're someone who likes keeping a physical record of your tech purchases.💬 Final ThoughtsIf you're looking for a great value smartwatch with long battery life and smooth pairing to your Samsung phone, this one’s a solid choice.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"I bought and “excellent condition” watch and this is what I received. I have MULTIPLE problems! Please read if you’re thinking about buying.First major complaint is the fact I paid EXTRA to receive a like new/ excellent condition watch. The watch I received is what I expected from purchasing “good condition”. Almost every corner is scratch.The second picture is the box it came in. Extremely sketchy. This watch was supposed to be the 5th generation, but if you look very closely at the band they gave me for the watch it says “for Samsung galaxy 4”.Last problem, but DEFINITELY THE WORST ONE… the battery was completely dead. At first I didn’t know if it was gonna turn on after charging for a whole hour. If you know anything about lithium batteries you would know it should never ever be completely dead as that ruins the potential for the battery to hold a full charge. With that being said I’m assuming this will die very quickly.In conclusion, i recommend whole heartedly to just purchase a watch brand new.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"The watch arrived completely dead and with no charge. It finally showed 0% on charger after short while on the charger.

Samsung Galaxy Fit 3,"My wife and I have been fitbit fans since the Charge 2 (2016).  Before the google purchase, fitbit was a strong leader in lower cost fitness trackers.  It did concern us that our fitbits would die frequently (nearly each one we had died within a year from the Charge 2, 3, 4). However after talking with customer service they would send us replacement.  So, ok, we can deal with that.  (Even though in the past few years you had to provide a ton of documentation including, IIRC, your drivers license.)I had a fitbit 6 that I got for Christmas 2024.  Wow, a color screen.  LOL.  I needed a replacement as the screen on my Charge 5 kept getting dimmer, and dimmer, to the point when I could not read it outdoors and barely indoors.  So I was gifted the Charge 6 and it was big step up.  But it took me a few months until I realized that the floors option was gone, not just not working, but removed, to make space for other features I could care less about.So I looked around in late June and discovered the Fit 3.  So I bought one.  I am SO GLAD I did.  What do I need?  Step counter, heart rate, floors, distance, calories.  Oh, and the kicker for me was AIRPLANE MODE.  I study various energetic sciences including BioGeometry and the EMF coming from our devices is not benign.  I don't wear a tracker to sleep, don't want anything live, and keep my blue tooth turned off unless I am actively syncing.This is what I see comparing Fit 3 to Fitbit Charge 6.   What the Fit 3 has as an advantage:  Larger screen, airplane mode, beautiful faces, much cleaner UI on the watch and in the android app(s) (I am using this with a Pixel 7 phone).  The ability to sync only turning on bluetooth.  A few years ago fitbit/google basically said we aren't syncing your fitbit unless you have both location/GPS and bluetooth turned on.  Sometimes you could get the fitbit to sync with location off but this was tricky/spotty.What advantages did the Charge 6 have for me, personally.   None really.  It cost about 3x the amount for the Charge 6 compared to the Fit 3.  That's ridiculous.In a head to head comparsion of measurements this is what I see.   Fitbit Charge is often slower to start your step counts and the Fit 3 is quicker on that.  So you steps counts are going to go up and perhaps the Fit 3 does count some arm motions as steps when it should not.  But the Fit 3 is still very close (within 1-3%) with the Charge 6.  The Fit 3 tends to undercount calories compared to the Charge 6, I can't tell which is more accurate.  On the Charge 6 bluetooth syncing was always a laborious pain taking sometimes minutes to get the past few days of data and often having to turn bluetooth off/on and/or restarts to get it to sync.  The Fit 3 is very fast *most* of the time.  I did have one instance where the Fit 3 was not syncing in the Health App and I had to open the Wearable app and trigger a sync from there, which worked.The big thing is battery life.  I have automatic activity tracking turned on and except when syncing in the evening I keep it on airplane mode.  I charged it overnight last Thursday/Friday before I first put it on.  It's now Wednesday evening, nearing 6 complete days of use and my battery level is at 55%.  That frugal energy use is really good and is on par with the earlier monochrome fitbits.I am very pleased with my Fit 3 purchase.  Back in the early to mid 2000's I was very excited about Timex was doing just in digital watches (Iron Man, etc).  The Fit 3 harkens back to those kind of days for me when you could get a very full functionality wrist device that looked good, worked great, and was a good deal.  This is definitely worth a close look if you don't need an higher priced fitness/communication device that is emitting EMFs into your pericardium meridian 24x7.  Well done.",5.0,Positive,"['wife', 'fitbit',

Samsung Galaxy Fit 3,"I bought this watch because I was looking for a smaller watch to wear to bed and around the house to keep an eye on my sleep and Heart Rate and so on. On that note it seems to do great at tracking my HR and sleep. I have tried quite a few other watches and just could not find one that worked for me but this one is small enough that it's comfortable to wear at all times and even great to wear when sleeping. I have not had any issues with it's phone connection it seems to stay connected the only time it looses connection is when I walk across to the other side of my house but as soon as I get back within range it instantly reconnects to my phone with no issues.It's nice because I can keep track of the battery level of my phone (Galaxy Flip 6) and watch using my watch.I do wish it had a speaker just for receiving notifications, phone calls and alarms but the vibration does a good enough job of letting me know.I can usually get about 5-6 days of battery life out of it and the battery charges quite quickly.One of the only complaints I have so far for this watch is the band has a connection system that requires you to buy an adaptor if you want to use another type of watch band.

I can easily check messages and track my workouts without any hassle, and it’s comfortable enough to wear all day without feeling bulky.However, I do wish the battery life were a bit better.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"I found out why my watch will not stay charged (in case anyone else has the same issue). The app is no longer applicable to this watch version, so I can't do a factory reset to fix it. I've ordered the new Galaxy S25 from Samsung which is how I found out about the app.I have always been a Samsung customer, phones, computers, etc.  I had a Fitbit Versa 2 and it finally died.  All I want from a wearable device is number of steps walked, heart rate, and the sleep information.  I know the Samsung has many more capabilities, but these are all I want to use (plus the time of day).  When mine came I only set the above readings to be active. I like the look of the watch and I would be happy if it would just work. After charging it and it charges quickly the battery lasts about 6 hours.  This past week it has begun to charge sometimes and other times I'll pick it up and all it will show is 0% and the icon indicating it needs to be charged.  I've done everything I know to do in the app and on the Samsung site.  If anyone out there has a suggestion as to how to fix it, please let me know through Amazon's messaging system.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"UPDATE: I've had this watch for about a month now.  I am very happy with it.I bought it for work, so I could leave my phone in my bag but still be able to see phone calls or messages. (I have 2 autistic kids, I need to be reachable). I sweat to much at work to keep my phone in my pocket, it tends to be loud at work, and I dont feel the vibration in my pocket when I'm moving. All causing me to miss important calls and messages. This watch is my solution.I've tried other brands in the past and they were not reliable at all. The connectivity is very good on this one, I can be several feet from my bag and have no problems. Messages and phone calls come thru every time.Although I did not buy this for the fitness features, I will say they are neat. I work in a factory and I find it amusing that it starts an auto workout whenever I'm packing. Its interesting to see the results at the end of the day. I have not used this for sleep, I mainly only wear it at work. In doing so, I only need to charge it every 3ish days, the charge holds well. And it only takes an hour and a half or so to charge.The app is easy to use and I like all the options available to customize.I was very nervous buying renewed. But so far I am beyond happy with this watch. There is absolutely nothing to indicate it had ever been used. It works as it should and has held up well getting banged around at work. I also like that it is not really big or bulky.I did replace the band with a silicone break away band for work. I like the new band better as the original was very stiff on the sides.Did not come in original packaging,  which is fine,  I expected that.The watch literally looks like it was never worn. Not a scuff or smudge anywhere.Fired up and synced with the app with no problems.Seems to work as its supposed to so far. Calls and messages received. I like the customization.But since this is renewed, I'm skeptical.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"It's a good watch, but there are some disappointing experiences:1) First time I went for a run and wanted to test out the cellular connection, it overheated and told me to wait.  This happened twice since I've owned the watch, and it's usually been on actually hot days.  I do have a protective cover, so that may be part o the problem.2) Run tracking is buggy...sometimes.  I often start my run from my front door, where my watch has a connection with either my WiFi or phone.  When I start a run from this location, it always seems to have trouble determining how far I've run.  I'll be 3 minutes into my run and it will say I've done a mile (I wish!).  If I bring my phone with me, there is no issue.  If I drive to a trail and run it does perfectly fine.  I have the feeling their run tracking is using a WiFi rough location to start my run.3) Spotify.  This won't count against the watch so much, because it's probably mostly a software issue.  I would think it's a pretty good chance that using Spotify with headphones while you're not around your phone is a pretty good use case for a cellular watch.  This does work, but it's really not intuitive to use.  Sometimes the Spotify UI will just sit there and not tell you whether it's trying to play something, or if it's loading, or whatever.  You can literally sit there for minutes fiddling around trying to figure out what Spotify is trying to do.  Sometimes when it does work, the events are delayed.  For instance I may have chosen a song 10 seconds ago, and gotten no feedback from the UI, yet it will eventually play something.4) Google's apps aren't fully integrated.  It's like they're still not fully committed to wearables.  For instance, if someone is at the door, you will get a notification.  Would you like to see who it is?  Well, you will have to go find your phone.  There are many apps that don't show useful notifications on the watch.  There is so much opportunity to make wearables actually much better than they are, and it's frustrating that Google just doesn't put in the effort.That's pretty much the bad stuff.  Now for the good news.  When this watch works, it does a really nice job.  The watch faces built in are really nice IMO, and you can customize them pretty well with useful shortcuts. (I added a shortcut to start a workout and another to set a timer).  We do get Google Assistant now, and I've assigned mine to be triggered by long pressing one of the buttons.  Google pay works fine for me.  In my experience the battery is much much better than my previous Android watches, which removes some level of anxiety.  The build quality is great.  I am rough with my watches, and the screen on this one is pretty much scratch free at this point.  I take this in the pool and in the shower, so absolutely no issues with water exposure.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"I bought a Galaxy watch 1 refurbished in February of 2020 and wore it most every day with out any issues at all.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"Been about a month since I've purchased this renewed version of the GW5 pro. It came almost flawless, besides a few minor scuffs on the outer bezel. With all features on, continuous monitoring, adaptive brightness, Wifi, Bluetooth, NFC, sleep, step & stress tracking on, along with frequently checking messages, weather radar, and my daily planner, I can get about 36 hours of battery life. With all those features off on power save mode, it can last roughly 60 hours. So depending on the desired use, you have a decent window to work with. I charge mine once per day, typically on my lunch break. Charge time takes about an hour to fully charge from 40%. Even faster if you shut the watch off. If you're not worried about a rotating bezel, the GW5 PRO is a fantastic smart watch. Even more so than the GW6 classic in my experience, which when fully utilized dies in about 20 hours. My GW6 classic is about 20 feet deep in my local lakeside community and honestly, I'm glad I got the GW5 pro. I couldn't deal with the constant need to charge. Also, the new One UI 6.0 and the wear OS 5.0 update that came thru a few weeks ago seemingly gave the watch a smoother look, feel and font, along with more accurate sleep and health monitoring abilities. 5🌟 All day.",5.0,Positive,"['month', 'since', 'ive', 'purchase', 'renew', 'version', 'gw', 'pro', 'come', 'almost', 'flawless', 'besides', 'minor', 'scuff', 'outer', 'bezel', 'feature', 'continuous', 'monitor', 'adaptive', 'brightness', 'wifi', 'bluetooth', 'nfc', 'sleep', 'step', 'stress', 'track', 'along', 'frequently', 'check', 'message', 'weather', 'radar', 'daily', 'planner', 'get', 'hour', 'battery', 'life', 'feature', 'power', 'save', 'mode', 'last', 'roughly', 'hour', 'depend', 'desire', 'use', 'decent', 'window', 'work', 'charge', 'mine', 'per', 'day', 'typically', 'lunch', 'break', 'charge', 'time', 'take', 'hour', 'fully', 'charge', 'even', 'faster', 'shut', 'watch', 'youre', 'worry', 'rotate', 'bezel', 'gw', 'pro', 'fantastic', 'smart', 'watch', 'even', 'gw', 'classic', 'experience', 'fully', 'utilized', 'dy', 'hour', 'gw', 'classic', 'foot', 'deep', 'local', 'lakeside', 'community', 'honestly', 'im', 'glad', 'get', 'gw', 'pro', 'couldnt', 'deal', 'constant', 'need', 'charge', 'also', 'new', 'one', 'ui', 'wear', 'os', 'update', 'come', 'thru', 'week', 'ago', 'seemingly', 'give', 'watch', 'smoother', 'look', 'feel', 'font', 'along', 'accurate', 'sleep', 'health', 'monitoring', 'ability', 'day']",month since ive purchase renew version gw pro come almost flawless besides minor scuff outer bezel feature continuous monitor adaptive brightness wifi bluetooth nfc sleep step stress track along frequently check message weather radar daily planner get hour battery life feature power save mode last roughly hour depend desire use decent window work charge mine per day typically lunch break charge time take hour fully charge even faster shut watch youre worry rotate bezel gw pro fantastic smart watch even gw classic experience fully utilized dy hour gw classic foot deep local lakeside community honestly im glad get gw pro couldnt deal constant need charge also new one ui wear os update come thru week ago seemingly give watch smoother look feel font along accurate sleep health monitoring ability day
Samsung Galaxy Watch5,"So I ended up buying this watch about a week before the 7 series dropped. I haven't kept up on watches, had the original Samsung watch, loved the looks, but was worthless to me because I couldn't even make it through a work day without charging. My fitbit died, so I went looking, saw reviews talking about battery and saw the price and went for it. Then the 7 came out and I felt like I made a mistake.I certainly did not. This thing is a beast on the battery. I get a ton of notifications, reply to them, play around on it, and easily get more than 2 days of use. I typically just charge it in the mornings as I get ready for work. Yes, I wear it as I sleep for tracking.The 'renewed' or whatever this is, is great. Not a scratch on it, looks absolutely brand new. The charger they send with sucks. Sucks really bad. Order yourself an OEM charger and toss the one that comes with it right away, or else you'll be charging an hour a day... With the OEM you do not need to do that.It's big, it's light on the wrist with the titanium, I'm extremely rough on watches, each Fitbit I owned was scratched up within days, after a couple of weeks, this still doesn't have a mark on it.

Samsung Galaxy Watch5,"It's a great vendor and a wonderful watch. I am just loving this Samsung watch. This was purchased renewed. The battery life is very close to new.

Samsung Galaxy Watch5,"I was looking into a fitness tracker when I stumbled across the ""Amazon Refreshed"" Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. I never wanted a smart watch, but I did want a way to track heart rate, steps, and my workouts. For the price of the refreshed option and the comfort of knowing I could return it if it wasn't as expected, I figured, why not give it a try? I'm a Galaxy girl and have all Samsung devices so it fits right in.First, the watch shipped without original packaging - there were a couple comments that said they received all the original packaging so I was initially a little bummed about that. But not like I need more packaging to take up space. The charger included in the box is not OEM but it does work to charge the watch (it is the slower 1A 5V charger). The watch itself looks brand new. Can't tell that it had been used at all. I put it through its paces and it seems to hold a charge very well. I had actually also purchased the black version and the Watch 6 (both refreshed) to see which one I like best. The 6 came in OEM packaging and while I preferred the size of the watch 6, the battery life couldn't come close to the 5 Pro. I also preferred the brushed nickel look over the black version of the 5 Pro. I was worried because this model indicated it is the Latin America version, but it works just like the other 5 Pro.The watch is huge and I have very small wrists so it has been an adjustment wearing something so bulky. The OEM band was too big for me and even though I made it work, the excess strap caused an awkward fit. I replaced the band with a thinner silicone band and it is much more comfortable now.That said, the features that it offers are impressive. My favorites: body composition analysis, sleep tracking, integration with Samsung Health and my fitness apps such as GymRun & MyNetDiary. I also love being able to get messages and texts without having to pick up my phone. This watch is a key motivator in helping me achieve my fitness goals so for that aspect alone, worth the refreshed cost!

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"I've had a 4 Classic since 2021 and there's enough to like about it that I haven't seen a watch I'd rather have. The battery life is the biggest downside. You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"Had this watch for about a week now. I was initially hesitant about the purchase, as this is my first smart watch. After research, and getting acquainted with the tool, I'm so happy I pulled the trigger. I use it every day for surprisingly detailed sleep tracking, enhanced step/activity tracking, ease of checking notifications and responding when I don't have easy access to my phone (or if I'm not supposed to at work), and on top of all of that, it's just a fantastic looking watch. The amount of functions you have access to is fantastic. I have paid more in my life for a watch that literally could only tell time. Lol. I know the health monitoring data may not be spot on, but it has really helped me focus on the right things during day to day. If you're on the fence, do it. If you have a Samsung phone, definitely do it.Some tips:1.) I recommend the first thing you do is order the official Samsung wireless charger to go with it. The charger shipped with this watch is off-brand and charges at about 5 watts, which takes about 2.5-3 hours. The Samsung charger provides 10 watt fast charging which takes 90 minutes at most. Again, the included charger is aftermarket, and slooowww. Get the Samsung one. The battery life on this watch is good, but not phenomenal, so having a faster charger is key to low stress ownership. These smart devices take at least one or two charge cycles to optimize battery use, so be patient with the first couple of battery cycles. I got one day out of the first two, then started getting a full 2 days easy, with slight tweaks to functions, but still fairly liberal use. I've attached screen shots of my batter usage stats after the break in period. If you want to have everything running all day at full capacity, again definitely get the Samsung charger so you can juice up faster after a day of heavy use.2.) This is not a brand new watch. It was manufactured in 2022, and used by a previous owner for years. Do not expect it to be in perfect cosmetic condition. For the price, I think this is reasonable (approx $100 vs $400 new when it came out). Mine has a couple of blemishes, but the screen is in excellent condition. Still looks great to my eye! Consider getting a case and screen protector.3.) I also recommend taking some rubbing alcohol, a micro fiber cloth, and some q-tips to the watch on arrival. The refurbishing on it is okay, but I did still clean off a thin layer of built up grime from the previous owner, especially in some hard to reach spots.4.) If you are fairly active I recommend getting a different band for the watch. The OEM rubber one ends up slipping all over anytime I build up a sweat. If I try to tighten it enough to stay still, it ends up pinching and cutting off blood flow. I work in food service, so having to constantly readjust the position through my shift has been annoying. I also have slim wrists, and forums seem to say the ""no gap"" bands are to be avoided. You want that gap so the band can bend down from the mounting point to provide more wrist contact.In summary: This watch has been a super enjoyable addition to my health tracking, Samsung ecosystem, and just general gadgets I use on the daily. I love it! Still giving it 5 stars despite the effort I've had to put in to make everything work right for me, because the price is an absolute steal. I don't have money for a brand new smart watch, but this one still holds its own with the current market, from what I've gathered, and even provides better battery life than a lot of brand new

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"Like many others, I got the watch refurbished to save half off the sticker, which is still pricey for a last gen model. I figured since Amazon was fulfilling the order, it would be easier and safer to replace a defective one if I got unlucky (as I have been burned before and am very wary of renewed products).It's been about a week and to be honest I was expecting glitches, but none have yet to be found! The refurbishing partner clearly knows what they're doing in fixing up their tech. The original seller listed for my purchase was Chubbiestech.The only thing to be aware of is that there is clear evidence that this is an opened and refurbished product - adhesive remnants around the face edge and some scuff marks around the ring were the first things I noticed upon opening the package. That being said, these were very minor blemishes that I ended up covering anyway with a watch case. The screen itself is completely clear of any scratches or marks, and so far responds to touch very well.The operating system seems to respond at a fair speed. Not having owned a brand new version of this same watch, I can't say much more than this. By general ""feeling"" of OS responsiveness, this watch could maybe be smoother as it sometimes hesitates or stutters between changing screens. However, it could very well be the limitation of Samsung's OS itself and not anything to do with the refurbishment.Battery life has also been fair - the watch would last me about 72 hours as a moderate user (daily exercise, step count, HR monitor every 10 minutes, overnight for sleep tracking). Heavier use (music, phone calls) brings down the battery a lot faster as to be expected, but I see it lasting at minimum 24 hours without charge. Charging takes about 20 minutes to juice up ~30%, so I can expect a full charge in 1 hour as long as the watch isn't dead. I did not receive a Samsung charger, but the unbranded one works just as well.Overall, super happy about this purchase, and even happier for getting it basically half off the market price for a brand new one!",5.0,Positive,"['like', 'many', 'others', 'get', 'watch', 'refurbish', 'save', 'half', 'sticker', 'still', 'pricey', 'last', 'gen', 'model', 'figure', 'since', 'amazon', 'fulfilling', 'order', 'would', 'easier', 'safe', 'replace', 'defective', 'one', 'get', 'unlucky', 'burn', 'wary', 'renew', 'productsits', 'week', 'honest', 'expect', 'glitch', 'none', 'yet', 'find', 'refurbishing', 'partner', 'clearly', 'know', 'theyre', 'fix', 'tech', 'original', 'seller', 'listed', 'purchase', 'chubbiestechthe', 'thing', 'aware', 'clear', 'evidence', 'open', 'refurbished', 'product', 'adhesive', 'remnant', 'around', 'face', 'edge', 'scuff', 'mark', 'around', 'ring', 'first', 'thing', 'notice', 'upon', 'open', 'package', 'say', 'minor', 'blemish', 'end', 'cover', 'anyway', 'watch', 'case', 'screen', 'completely', 'clear', 'scratch', 'mark', 'far', 'respond', 'touch', 'wellthe', 'operating', 'system', 'seem', 'respond', 'fair', 'speed', 'own', 'brand', 'new', 'version', 'watch', 'cant', 'say', 'much', 'general', 'feeling', 'os', 'responsiveness', 'watch', 'could', 'maybe', 'smooth', 'sometimes', 'hesitate', 'stutter', 'change', 'screen', 'however', 'could', 'well', 'limitation', 'samsungs', 'o', 'anything', 'refurbishmentbattery', 'life', 'also', 'fair', 'watch', 'would', 'last', 'hour', 'moderate', 'user', 'daily', 'exercise', 'step', 'count', 'hour', 'monitor', 'every', 'minute', 'overnight', 'sleep', 'track', 'heavy', 'use', 'music', 'phone', 'call', 'bring', 'battery', 'lot', 'faster', 'expect', 'see', 'last', 'minimum', 'hour', 'without', 'charge', 'charge', 'take', 'minute', 'juice', 'expect', 'full', 'charge', 'hour', 'long', 'watch', 'isnt', 'dead', 'receive', 'samsung', 'charger', 'unbranded', 'one', 'work', 'welloverall', 'super', 'happy', 'purchase', 'even', 'happier', 'get', 'basically', 'half', 'market', 'price', 'brand', 'new', 'one']",like many others get watch refurbish save half sticker still pricey last gen model figure since amazon fulfilling order would easier safe replace defective one get unlucky burn wary renew productsits week honest expect glitch none yet find refurbishing partner clearly know theyre fix tech original seller listed purchase chubbiestechthe thing aware clear evidence open refurbished product adhesive remnant around face edge scuff mark around ring first thing notice upon open package say minor blemish end cover anyway watch case screen completely clear scratch mark far respond touch wellthe operating system seem respond fair speed own brand new version watch cant say much general feeling os responsiveness watch could maybe smooth sometimes hesitate stutter change screen however could well limitation samsungs o anything refurbishmentbattery life also fair watch would last hour moderate user daily exercise step count hour monitor every minute overnight sleep track heavy use music phone call bring battery lot faster expect see last minimum hour without charge charge take minute juice expect full charge hour long watch isnt dead receive samsung charger unbranded one work welloverall super happy purchase even happier get basically half market price brand new one

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"For a couple years I've been searching for a watch that had multiple alarms that can be set to vibrate. Seems pretty simple I thought. Not so! Being a fan of Casio watches I hoped they would have one. They have watches that vibrate, but none with multiple alarms. I tried a few off-brand smart watches, they were a pain to use. I really didn't want to spend 300 bucks on a watch to have this seeming simple feature. On a whim, I decided to try a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. 99 bucks, and if it doesn't do the trick, I'll return it and continue searching. This watch does it! Yay! The fact that I can set it up from my phone is an added bonus; being 65, my eyes ain't what they used to be. So I got various alarms set up (coffee brew, wings on the grill, etc.) and was pretty happy. I don't really care about all the health stuff. What really pleased me was when I was listening to music from my Plex server on a Plex HTPC. I was controlling the music from my computer, but also had Plexamp open on my phone. All of a sudden I look at my watch, and there is a Plexamp interface! Whoa! I can control the tunes from my phone too! How awesome is that?!

Samsung Galaxy Fit 3,"Why did you pick this product vs others?:I chose this Samsung fitness tracker for the price, much cheaper than Fitbit, and because I have a Samsung phone. I got it mainly for the step tracking feature to encourage myself to walk more. I'm really enjoying it and it seems to work quite well (so far the most I have done is 17,000). But my goal is 10,000/day, which I meet probably half of the time. My second most favorite feature is the ""Find my phone"" feature, just tap it and the phone beeps loudly. (Awesome!!) I've missed wearing  a watch, so I  really like that, and finally seeing texts pop up is nice too, so that I don't have to have my phone right with me always. I tried it at night to track my sleep for a couple of nights, but I decided that probably wasn't healthy to wear it constantly. It seemed accurate though. I like the way it looks and also I like thar it is water resistant. I purchased protective face covers that work great also. It paired easily to my Samsung Galaxy A13  phone.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"This is a Bluetooth only Galaxy Watch 6 Classic in 47mm size.  It is the classic version so it has a rotating bezel.  The one I ordered is a stainless steel silver color and has a gray silicone band.  It is the third galaxy watch I have had, but the first I have purchased ""renewed.""  Out of the box it took about 8 minutes to set up.  The initial setup started as soon as I turned on the watch and my phone found it (I didn't even have to open the Galaxy Wear app, but that is probably because I already had a Galaxy Watch 4 connected.)  The only hitches in the setup were with the Google tie in to the watch, I had to do two steps twice to get them to complete.  The downside on the watch as received is that is had roughly a 5% charge, so getting started with updates, connection, setup, etc. without putting it on a charger would have been an issue.  I put it on a charger and continued the process once I realized the battery was so low.  I would recommend charging the watch first before starting the process to be safe.  The watch came in a zip lock plastic bag and the only other thing in the box was a magnetic charger base that plugs into a USB A port.  There were no instructions or any other items, so for a user who is new to a Galaxy watch this could be a bit of a problem.  The watch looks very good, the case looks like new, the strap looks like new, the display also looks like new, only the black outer part of the back looks like it has seen some wear.  I plan to give it a thorough cleaning with the disposable alcohol cleaning towelettes that I use to clean glasses once it is fully charged.  Because I had already used a Galaxy watch, the setup transferred all my settings, apps, and the watch face to this watch, which probably shortens the setup time.  A 47mm watch size is pretty large, so it might not be preferable for smaller wrists, but I am hopeful that the battery may last a little longer than the 43/44mm models.  The watch uses the same quick release 20mm bands that most other Galaxy watches use, which I consider to be a huge advantage over custom bands.  The renewed sixth generation watch cost about 43% of what a new similar seventh generation watch costs, so I thought is was worth taking the chance on a renewed watch.  The watch is a little heavier than the forth gen basic version I have, but I think the larger case and rotating bezel are worth the extra weight.",5.0,Positive,"['bluetooth', 'galaxy', 'watch', 'classic', 'mm', 'size', 'classic', 'version', 'rotate', 'bezel', 'one', 'order', 'stainless', 'steel', 'silver', 'color', 'gray', 'silicone', 'band', 'third', 'galaxy', 'watch', 'first', 'purchase', 'renew', 'box', 'take', 'minute', 'set', 'initial', 'setup', 'start', 'soon', 'turned', 'watch', 'phone', 'find', 'didnt', 'even', 'open', 'galaxy', 'wear', 'application', 'probably', 'already', 'galaxy', 'watch', 'connect', 'hitch', 'setup', 'google', 'tie', 'watch', 'two', 'step', 'twice', 'get', 'complete', 'downside', 'watch', 'receive', 'roughly', 'charge', 'get', 'start', 'update', 'connection', 'setup', 'and so on', 'without', 'put', 'charger', 'would', 'issue', 'put', 'charger', 'continued', 'process', 'realize', 'battery', 'low', 'would', 'recommend', 'charge', 'watch', 'first', 'start', 'process', 'safe', 'watch', 'come', 'zip', 'lock', 'plastic', 'bag', 'thing', 'box', 'magnetic', 'charger', 'base', 'plug', 'usb', 'port', 'instruction', 'item', 'user', 'new', 'galaxy', 'watch', 'could', 'bite', 'problem', 'watch', 'look', 'good', 'case', 'look', 'like', 'new', 'strap', 'look', 'like', 'new', 'display', 'also', 'look', 'like', 'new', 'black', 'outer', 'part', 'back', 'look', 'like', 'see', 'wear', 'plan', 'give', 'thorough', 'cleaning', 'disposable', 'alcohol', 'cleaning', 'towelettes', 'use', 'clean', 'glass', 'fully', 'charge', 'already', 'use', 'galaxy', 'watch', 'setup', 'transfer', 'setting', 'application', 'watch', 'face', 'watch', 'probably', 'shorten', 'setup', 'time', 'mm', 'watch', 'size', 'pretty', 'large', 'might', 'preferable', 'small', 'wrist', 'hopeful', 'battery', 'may', 'last', 'little', 'long', 'mm', 'model', 'watch', 'use', 'quick', 'release', 'mm', 'band', 'galaxy', 'watch', 'use', 'consider', 'huge', 'advantage', 'custom', 'band', 'renew', 'sixth', 'generation', 'watch', 'cost', 'new', 'similar', 'seventh', 'generation', 'watch', 'cost', 'think', 'worth', 'take', 'chance', 'renew', 'watch', 'watch', 'little', 'heavy', 'forth', 'gen', 'basic', 'version', 'think', 'large', 'case', 'rotate', 'bezel', 'worth', 'extra', 'weight']",bluetooth galaxy watch classic mm size classic version rotate bezel one order stainless steel silver color gray silicone band third galaxy watch first purchase renew box take minute set initial setup start soon turned watch phone find didnt even open galaxy wear application probably already galaxy watch connect hitch setup google tie watch two step twice get complete downside watch receive roughly charge get start update connection setup and so on without put charger would issue put charger continued process realize battery low would recommend charge watch first start process safe watch come zip lock plastic bag thing box magnetic charger base plug usb port instruction item user new galaxy watch could bite problem watch look good case look like new strap look like new display also look like new black outer part back look like see wear plan give thorough cleaning disposable alcohol cleaning towelettes use clean glass fully charge already use galaxy watch setup transfer setting application watch face watch probably shorten setup time mm watch size pretty large might preferable small wrist hopeful battery may last little long mm model watch use quick release mm band galaxy watch use consider huge advantage custom band renew sixth generation watch cost new similar seventh generation watch cost think worth take chance renew watch watch little heavy forth gen basic version think large case rotate bezel worth extra weight
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,I have had the Samsung Galaxy Active 2 for years. It's been a solid staple that I love. Battery life was never disappointing..

Renewed.I didn't know what to expect. I was not expecting much actually. But when I opened the box and turned it on... Wow. I was totally impressed.It's bigger than I thought it would be. Not a deal breaker. But omg it is sooooo nice. The quality is amazing. The screen is awesome. It's easy to use. Easy to set up with lots of options.Apple watch who?!

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Okay, so I finally caved and got the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, and honestly? I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner! I was a bit hesitant about the price tag, but after a week of wearing this thing, I can confidently say it's worth every penny.First off, it just looks fantastic. The rotating bezel is back, and it feels so satisfying to click through menus. It gives it a real classic watch vibe, which I love. The screen is super crisp and bright, even when I'm out in the sun trying to read my notifications.Setting it up was a breeze – it paired with my Samsung phone instantly. I was a little worried about the battery life after reading some reviews, but it's been surprisingly good for me. I can easily get through a full day and night, even with using the sleep tracking and some light exercise tracking. I usually just pop it on the charger while I'm getting ready in the morning, and it's good to go again.Speaking of tracking, this watch is a beast! It tracks everything – my steps, my workouts (and it automatically detects some!), my sleep quality (which is actually pretty insightful), and even my heart rate and blood oxygen. It's given me a much better picture of my overall health and has motivated me to move more.The notifications are super handy too. I can see texts, emails, and app alerts right on my wrist, so I don't have to constantly pull out my phone. I can even reply to quick messages directly from the watch, which is a lifesaver when my hands are full.Honestly, I can't think of any major downsides. Maybe the price is a bit steep for some, but for the features and the premium feel, I think it's justified. If you're looking for a smartwatch that looks great, is packed with features, and actually makes your life a little easier, the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is a winner in my book.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"This is my first time getting a watch from Samsung. Previously I've used fitbit watches.So, my review.____Pros-----1. I like the style. Very nice, and it fits well (which is great because I have massive wrists, and normally have to get different bands.)2. It's very easy to use once set up, and has a lot of customization features.3. So far, haven't had any issues with the buttons getting stuck, or sticky.(I've only had it for a month so we'll see.) A little hard to clean dust out of the area where the bands connect (I work in a warehouse full of dust. So that's probably just a me problem)_____Cons------1. It takes a very long time to charge, and tends to die fast if it's not always plugged in. The charger does not always work, especially if it's plugged into an outlet with literally anything else plugged into said outlet.2. It gets very hot while charging and I have to detach it from the charger one in a while to let it cool down.3. It says it tracks my walking routes but I have no idea how to access them.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"So first things first I am a smartwatch virgin until now! My product arrived exactly as described, well packaged, and ready to go. It hooked up seamlessly (with the help of my 14yo daughter 🤣) to my Motorola G 5G with no problems at all.  All of the Samsung health functions seem to work pretty flawlessly, the only thing I can't use is the ECG but I knew that going in since I have a non Samsung phone. The wrist band that came with it is comfortable enough to wear to bed! I read a ton of reviews about battery life and I must admit the 1st day I wore it I thought the reviews were correct, but I love gadgets and I probably fiddled with it more than most and I had the brightness all of the way up and by 10am it was at 17%. I adjusted the notifications, and a few settings including when the screen turns on and brightness. I easily get at least 2 days on 1 charge.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"I couldn’t be happier with my upgrade to the galaxy 7 watch. I loved my galaxy 4 watch and therefore struggled with my decision to replace it until I received the 7 and started to use it. I thought the 4 was just fine with one big flaw…whenever I would use my Samsung clock app to set reminders, the reminder would go off on my phone but I was not able to dismiss it on my watch. Really annoying and it just seemed like a huge oversight on Samsung to not have their watch integrate with their clock app. I set a lot of reminders for everything, so this was a annoyance at least six times a day. Much to my delight the first time one of my reminders went off after putting on my watch I was able to swipe away the reminder that was ringing on my phone in another room! Other things I really like about it are the sleep apnea test, and just the overall smoothness of swiping between screens in the responsiveness of the screen even with a screen protector on it I’m sure there are lots of other things. I would begin to appreciate, but about the upgrade, but for now, the alarm integration was worth the price.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"Yes, the price is real.  Yes, there's a catch.  This watch is the International Edition that is registered for use ONLY in SE Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, etc.).  You cannot select regions outside of that on the watch and must instead set the region on your Samsung Account (using your phone).  However, this watch is fully compatible with ALL official accessories and comes in a real Samsung box with intact quality seal.  There are dozens of bands, cases, etc. in enough colors to make anyone happy.The watch itself is kind of a glorified sensor and your Galaxy phone does all the heavy lifting.  Note that US customers do NOT have access to the heart monitoring features (ECG/blood pressure).  It will simply say ""this function not available in your region"" and refuse to let you go further. However, it does measure blood oxygen, body composition, sleep parameters, etc.  It's also fairly stylish and the 40mm watch face is PLENTY big enough.  You can use your phone to download many kinds of useful watch faces, apps and such and push them to the watch. Using the Samsung Wear and Health apps (pre-installed on all Galaxy phones) makes using this pretty easy.  You can also take calls on it and the sound quality is good.  The other person might not even know you're using your watch!The watch charges with a little magnetic disk only as it has no ports on it.  You MUST use a magnetic charger.  You can get some second-party chargers that work.  The battery life, as with all smart watches, is pretty bad.  You will get through a day or so of light use but no more.  It wants you to wear it at night but it won't last that long so I tend to charge it up while I eat dinner so it will be topped off when I go to bed. A bonus is that the charger for it works well with external battery packs and connects pretty strongly so you can charge it in your bag if you were on a bus or plane. It also connects only with Bluetooth, so if you are in Airplane Mode, you will need to activate Bluetooth in Airplane Mode to get the watch to connect.The band is kind of wonky as the excess band goes UNDER the strap and not over it as a Casio band or typical band, but it's soft and the holes are numerous and finely spaced to give a good fit.  I like the way it feels and it seems quite sporty.  You can get other bands if you really want to change up the way it looks.Overall, this watch is pretty nice.  I have chargers at the office and home and I use the little included one in my travel bag. I am sure that, in 10 years, we will laugh at how primitive our watches were, but, for now, this is one of the best accessories for your Galaxy phone.  I believe it's a better deal than the Google watch and will probably be getting some of these for my family come Christmas.  I am only removing one star because the battery life is so wonky and the ECG feature isn't working.",4.0,Positive,"['yes', 'price', 'real', 'yes', 'there', 'catch', 'watch', 'international', 'edition', 'register', 'use', 'se', 'asia', 'thailand', 'vietnam', 'singapore', 'and so on', 'select', 'region', 'outside', 'watch', 'must', 'instead', 'set', 'region', 'samsung', 'account', 'use', 'phone', 'however', 'watch', 'fully', 'compatible', 'official', 'accessory', 'come', 'real', 'samsung', 'box', 'intact', 'quality', 'seal', 'dozen', 'band', 'case', 'and so on', 'enough', 'color', 'make', 'anyone', 'happythe', 'watch', 'kind', 'glorify', 'sensor', 'galaxy', 'phone', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'note', 'u', 'customer', 'access', 'heart', 'monitoring', 'feature', 'ecgblood', 'pressure', 'simply', 'say', 'function', 'available', 'region', 'refuse', 'let', 'go', 'however', 'measure', 'blood', 'oxygen', 'body', 'composition', 'sleep', 'parameter', 'and so on', 'also', 'fairly', 'stylish', 'mm', 'watch', 'face', 'plenty', 'big', 'enough', 'use', 'phone', 'download', 'many', 'kind', 'useful', 'watch', 'face', 'application', 'push', 'watch', 'use', 'samsung', 'wear', 'health', 'application', 'preinstalled', 'galaxy', 'phone', 'make', 'use', 'pretty', 'easy', 'also', 'take', 'call', 'sound', 'quality', 'good', 'person', 'might', 'even', 'know', 'youre', 'use', 'watchthe', 'watch', 'charge', 'little', 'magnetic', 'disk', 'port', 'must', 'use', 'magnetic', 'charger', 'get', 'secondparty', 'charger', 'work', 'battery', 'life', 'smart', 'watch', 'pretty', 'bad', 'get', 'day', 'light', 'use', 'want', 'wear', 'night', 'wont', 'last', 'long', 'tend', 'charge', 'eat', 'dinner', 'top', 'go', 'bed', 'bonus', 'charger', 'work', 'well', 'external', 'battery', 'pack', 'connect', 'pretty', 'strongly', 'charge', 'bag', 'bus', 'plane', 'also', 'connect', 'bluetooth', 'airplane', 'mode', 'need', 'activate', 'bluetooth', 'airplane', 'mode', 'get', 'watch', 'connectthe', 'band', 'kind', 'wonky', 'excess', 'band', 'go', 'strap', 'casio', 'band', 'typical', 'band', 'soft', 'hole', 'numerous', 'finely', 'spaced', 'give', 'good', 'fit', 'like', 'way', 'feel', 'seem', 'quite', 'sporty', 'get', 'band', 'really', 'want', 'change', 'way', 'looksoverall', 'watch', 'pretty', 'nice', 'charger', 'office', 'home', 'use', 'little', 'include', 'one', 'travel', 'bag', 'sure', 'year', 'laugh', 'primitive', 'watch', 'one', 'best', 'accessory', 'galaxy', 'phone', 'believe', 'good', 'deal', 'google', 'watch', 'probably', 'get', 'family', 'come', 'christmas', 'remove', 'one', 'star', 'battery', 'life', 'wonky', 'ecg', 'feature', 'isnt', 'work']",yes price real yes there catch watch international edition register use se asia thailand vietnam singapore and so on select region outside watch must instead set region samsung account use phone however watch fully compatible official accessory come real samsung box intact quality seal dozen band case and so on enough color make anyone happythe watch kind glorify sensor galaxy phone heavy lifting note u customer access heart monitoring feature ecgblood pressure simply say function available region refuse let go however measure blood oxygen body composition sleep parameter and so on also fairly stylish mm watch face plenty big enough use phone download many kind useful watch face application push watch use samsung wear health application preinstalled galaxy phone make use pretty easy also take call sound quality good person might even know youre use watchthe watch charge little magnetic disk port must use magnetic charger get secondparty charger work battery life smart watch pretty bad get day light use want wear night wont last long tend charge eat dinner top go bed bonus charger work well external battery pack connect pretty strongly charge bag bus plane also connect bluetooth airplane mode need activate bluetooth airplane mode get watch connectthe band kind wonky excess band go strap casio band typical band soft hole numerous finely spaced give good fit like way feel seem quite sporty get band really want change way looksoverall watch pretty nice charger office home use little include one travel bag sure year laugh primitive watch one best accessory galaxy phone believe good deal google watch probably get family come christmas remove one star battery life wonky ecg feature isnt work
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"I got the 47mm Watch Ultra. I had a hard time spending so much on watch, but now that its on my wrist, I'm so glad I got it. This is the best watch I've ever had; better than I had expected. Everything works as advertised, plus lots of fuctions. The screen is so big, it's easier to use than other smart watches I've had. The battery is really strong; I use it a lot at work for 12 hours and still go home with at least 75%. It keeps a charge better than my phone does. The microphone and voice-to-text works great. It's loud at work and the mic on my old phone couldn't hear me but this watch hears every word, crystal clear. Connectivity is great; I've had no problems with Bluetooth or WiFi, but I don't use the 4G so I don't know about that.My last watch was 42mm and this is 47mm.

Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"Had this watch for a few months now. And FINALLY there is a watch that doesn't just feel like its dead all the time. I charge this watch maybe once or twice a week depending on how much I use the functions on it. But the battery life is way better than any previous gen Samsung watch by ALOT. Ive had a handful of Galaxy watches  since the first Watch 2. And the biggest issue with smart watches was always just daily charging and feeling like it was just a worse cell phone you were attaching to yourself that was always dead when you wanted to use it. Now, it actually feels like a watch and even when using all the heart rate tracking features (which are super good btw), phone calls, all that. Battery will last about 3-4 days.

Scroll to the Pool Swim icon. Click on it and that is all to it.The display is very clear and informative. I do not look at it all the time, but I do like to take a quick peek at the time taken after every 100 meters to see how I fared.What I dislike:The watch monitors my heart rate, lap time, rest time between each lap, among other things. While the data does give an overall picture of my exercise, they are not entirely accurate. In particular, the heart rate data often does not agree with what I did.

Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is a premium smartwatch that truly shines, especially for those that want a full featured smart watch.Before this watch I purchased a Garmin Vivo and a Venu. They were both fine watches but they aren't truly smart watches, they are health trackers with some smart features. This watch is a smart watch first with health tracking as well, just not as good as the Garmins.PROSDurable and Stylish Design: The titanium build feels incredibly robust and ready to handle tough conditions, while still looking sleek and modern. The bright, crisp display is easy to read in any lighting.Smooth Performance: The watch is snappy and responsive, making navigation and app usage a breeze.Long-Lasting Battery: The battery life is a significant improvement over an iPhone watch for example. I found some tutorials online about optimizing the battery and I'm getting about 3.5 days on average.Useful Features: You can program some of the button to quick launch apps. I personally like to do this for the google assistant to set timers, reminders, or to get quick info about something.CONSBulky: The watch is on the large side compared to a Garmin VivoSport for example.Lacking Health: The watch has something to be desired on the health tracking side.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"The watch was as if it was brand new. The quality is pristine, with the only down side being that the original Samsung seals were open and replaced with third party seals. The watch looks very good and has no scratches, knicks, or damages of any kind! The size of the watch is normal but the band for the 40mm is small/medium so I had to get a third party watch band to fit my wrist. The battery life in general lasts around 2 days without AOD on. One thing to note, the first day you receive the watch it will look like the battery is draining super quick, that's normal. Just charge it until it's 100% and fully updated.

It's comfortable too. Great value!I was worried the color of the bezel would look too gold, however it does not. I purchased a separate stainless silver-link watch band, and a clear bezel protector.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"Perfect. Absolutely happy. It came in perfect shape, the box it was shipped in was the original because it was a remanufactured watch I suppose. Other than that it's a fantastic deal. I've had it for about a month. It's very durable. I did put a bezel protector and a face protector on it. There were only a few dollars and it's been very useful. The battery lasts about 2 days if the battery saver is on. It lasts a little over a day if the battery saver is off and I track my sleep.  The sleep tracker has more features than I'm used to. It will actually track multiple sessions of sleep in one night. I tend to wake up after a couple hours for 30 to 40 minutes and fall back asleep. My previous watch wouldn't track this. This watch catches all of my sleep time and rates it together. It gives you an energy score which is actually seeming pretty accurate. It also gives me very good insight into the things I need to do to improve my sleep hygiene. I've been working on this a lot and I still got a lot of good new useful information.

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I had a mi band 6 before this. The touch screen stopped responding after 3 years or so. To be fair, I was wearing it while working with spraying water and sludge, and I am hard on my watch. I am constantly banging it into things. I tried a 30 dollar knockoff smartwatch first as a replacement,  but it was too much fuss and irritation. I don't need to dial a phone number on my watch. Really all I was looking for was steps, heart rate,  time, and notifications.  The mi band 9 handles them all well. The screen is crisp and bright, easy to see in the sun or inside. Swiping on the screen works well.  You can select your own shortcuts to swipe left to. Notifications come over very quickly.  I have not noticed any extra battery drain. The vibration is perhaps a little lower than I would prefer, but it is enough to wake me up in the morning,  which I find much less irritating than the alarm on my phone. I would definitely recommend it.

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I'm a fan of the Xiaomi Smart Band. I used the Mi Band 5 and 7, and this time I bought the Mi Band 9. The app isn’t very intuitive, and the user guide for the Mi Band isn’t exactly easy to follow either. However, once I get used to the functions I want to use, the simplicity and lightweight comfort of the Mi Band make it the only one I end up using. The Mi Band 7 and 9 don’t seem to have changed much, but the 7 has been a great help to me over the past two years. The Mi Band 7 didn’t just stop working; it 'died in the line of duty,' having served me faithfully for two years before it passed away.I’ll tell you the story of how I first got introduced to the Mi Band. Back then, it was the Mi Band 5, but since the difference in features is not significant compared to the current Mi Band 9, it remains a useful reference before making a purchase.Company C’s warehouse somewhere in Asia—I worked 8 hours a day pulling a cart non-stop—literally no (official) break time. My job was to find the ordered items, load them up, and deliver them to the ladies who did the packing. The only time I could sit without worrying was during lunch. But being exhausted, full from eating, and sitting down? That’s a perfect recipe for dozing off every time. So, I decided to get myself a reliable alarm clock to keep me awake.I considered a $2 stopwatch from a dollar store (Daiso), but it got eliminated in the final round because changing the battery was a hassle. Instead, I ended up with a much pricier but fancier Mi Band 5. On the first day, I was just happy it told time accurately, but then I realized—it also counted my heartbeats while I was dozing off. Wow, new tech. But, seriously, why? At this point, it might as well have had a feature that automatically alerts a funeral home if my heart stops while I’m sleeping. Anyway, back to work I went.Here are my thoughts after using it for a few days—just personal impressions and some random questions. If you are already reading reviews, you probably know all the functions. So instead of a spec rundown, here’s how I actually use them:Sleep MonitoringIt sends something—electrical signals? Radio waves?—to my wrist at intervals I set (once every minute or every 10 minutes). The fact that only my wrist feels sore in the morning tells me I have clearly been in an inappropriate relationship with this gadget overnight. I don’t even use a microwave, and this doesn’t feel great. But it’s fascinating, so I give it two nights. Then it starts nagging me like my mom did 30 years ago: ""You went to bed too late. Sleep earlier. You didn’t get enough deep sleep."" It even logs the exact time I get up to use the bathroom. Now, that’s impressive.ExerciseThe only workout I do is running. I don’t have any heart conditions, so I never care about heart rate. But I do like that it tracks my distance. At my age, I need to brag about how far I can still run.Menstrual Cycle Tracking & AlertsI’m a guy.Battery Life & ChargingThe battery lasts forever. Charging is easy. No complaints.Stress MonitoringI already know when I’m stressed. Do I really need a watch to tell me? Also, it doesn’t seem to differentiate between stress, tension, and excitement—like the kind of excitement you get from certain situations, for example.Final ThoughtsIf you are old enough to need reading glasses to see this text, listen up: Mi Band 9’s font is tiny. If you just want the time displayed in big numbers, that’s fine, but cramming multiple bits of info on one screen? Forget it.It is packed with features, but let’s be real—who is actually going to check their sleep data every day for a year? Your sleep quality won’t improve just because you look at the numbers. And honestly, how many buyers really have serious arrhythmia concerns? Unless you do, heart rate tracking isn’t that useful. Also, if your phone is within reach, why would you squint at this tiny screen for texts or fumble with your fat fingers trying to change songs? That’s just comedy.It is basically a cute gadget watch. But!If you’ve read this far, you’re already too invested. Let’s be real—you’ll probably hit that ""Buy Now"" button tonight and go to bed pretending it never happened. Just get this over with, and stop thinking about your next purchase for now. Free yourself from the agony—buy it now, and move on.Objectively, just the watch and step tracker alone make it worth it. It also has a handy feature to help you find your phone. A solid, sleek, and not-too-cheap-looking digital watch for under $45? That’s not easy to find. And if playing around with its features makes you enjoy working out for a month or two, that alone justifies the price. For serious fitness folks, you might even discover more useful functions than I did.And when you get bored? Swap out the band (about $7) or trade it with your nephew for an Attack on Titan figurine, a popular anime character. It has a design that kids totally fall for.Good luck.",4.0,Positive,"['im', 'fan', 'xiaomi', 'smart', 'band', 'use', 'mi', 'band', 'time', 'buy', 'mi', 'band', 'application', 'isnt', 'intuitive',

The size is right for me, the display is large and easy to read and there are plenty of watch faces to choose from. I'm not into sports or workouts so it's had light use so far. At just over two weeks it still has over 50 percent charge. I like the sleep tracker and heart rate monitor and the text and phone alerts have been useful. I've used the timer function too and it beats having to pull out my phone and go through the process of setting a timer on it. I swapped out the band it came with after wearing it a few days.

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"As a former Fitbit and Samsung fitness watch wearer I am extremely pleased with this item. I get the same, if not more options,  than I did with my previous higher end watches for a fraction of the cost. The battery lasts for days and days. I can track sleep, heart rate, steps, get my text messages and app messages.  I'm still diving into everything it can do. The only drawbacks are it doesn't sync directly with any of my fitness apps but Samsung offers a backdoor way of syncing it's information via the Samsung health app on my phone. Another drawback is that it drains your phone battery much quicker due to the constant connection between the watch and phone. I just turn off the Bluetooth connection when I don't need the notifications from my phone pinged to my watch. However there's still a good bit of drain from the app even after this has been done.

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I bought this because the old fitbit that I used at work broke. I have an Apple watch but then I don’t want to use it because I’m afraid it will end up being broken at work too (I already broke 2 Fitbit watches due to the nature of my work). And since it’s almost the same size as my fitbit, my husband recommended this brand. I usually don’t wear watch when I’m at home but now even after work, I’m still wearing it. I like how it tracks my sleep hours, steps and calories burned. My apple watch has too much apps that I don’t need, gets low batt easily, and it looks big for my small wrist (I got it as a gift). Xiaomi has the basic apps that I need making it battery efficient. I can go on days without charging it. I only charge it when I drive (30mins most of the time) and that’s enough to have it 100% charged. I love its size compared to my apple watch too. Not too wide. Just right for my wrist size. I sometimes forget that I’m wearing it. The straps are easy to put on with a snap. There’s a decent amount of display themes to choose from. The 2 downsides for me: 1. The brightness doesn’t adjust, so when it’s bedtime and I move my arm…tadaaa bright display coming up. 2. It doesn’t sync every time like my Apple watch. Sometimes I have to manually sync it using the app so my stats will record or the weather gets updated on the watch. But nonetheless, it’s still a 5 stars for me because I love the functionality and ease of use of this watch.

Have been using it for about 2 weeks now and it meets all my requirements. It’s light enough to keep it on my wrist during sleeping. It tracks your sleep patterns pretty well, counts your steps and so much more. It was a breeze to connect it to my phone and what I like about it the most is that a battery lasts a long time, it takes about 50 min to charge from 0 to 100% and the battery lasts few weeks.",5.0,Positive,"['first', 'would', 'like', 'say', 'delivery', 'fast', 'also', 'well', 'packed', 'love', 'xiaomi', 'smart', 'band', 'use', 'week', 'meet', 'requirement', 'light', 'enough', 'keep', 'wrist', 'sleep', 'track', 'sleep', 'pattern', 'pretty', 'well', 'count', 'step', 'much', 'breeze', 'connect', 'phone', 'like', 'battery', 'last', 'long', 'time', 'take', 'min', 'charge', 'battery', 'last', 'week']",first would like say delivery fast also well packed love xiaomi smart band use week meet requirement light enough keep wrist sleep track sleep pattern pretty well count step much breeze connect phone like battery last long time take min charge battery last week
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I bought this to replace my Galaxy Watch 5 (and a pink one to replace my girlfriend's Galaxy Watch 4), because we had to charge our watches every 14 hours or so and they were getting more sluggish by the month. I always like to break electronics down on a simple pros & cons list, so let's have at it (in alphabetical order)._:PROS:_- Battery life is superb. I could definitely see getting 3 weeks out of a charge if I turned off all the extra features. As it stands, I typically get at least 10 days with sleep tracking and AOD (always-on-display) turned on, (both of which the watch warns you will reduce battery life). Charging from ~10% to 100 only takes about 2 hours as well on a normal 1A charger.--- Battery optimization options also are excellent, such as ""smart AOD"" (turns the screen off when the watch detects you're sleeping or when the watch isn't on your wrist at all). They can easily be found in Settings (gear icon)->Battery or Display.- Exercise tracking has become very accurate after only TWO treadmill walks. There is an option at the end of walking or treadmill workouts to calibrate the distance traveled.--- I did not realize this until AFTER my first treadmill walk, so I set my next distance walk to 2.2 mi, which is VERY close to 3.22 km.----- It was over by about 200 meters, so I adjusted it to 3.22 and then my 3rd treadmill walk was within 0.01 km of my actual distance traveled, according to the treadmill, so I was very impressed by that.- Notifications come through quickly from your default apps (messages, phone calls, email) as well as any other app that can send notifications to your phone, like games, security camera apps, etc.--- Although pictures will not be displayed (MMS messages), texts with emojis do work.--- You cannot answer calls from the watch, but you can mute or reject them as caller ID does pop up.--- There is an option in the settings to deactivate notifications while your phone screen is unlocked, which is nice so you're not getting them in two places at once.- Screen and overall user interface is very responsive - I was slightly uneasy about buying a watch with no buttons at all, but the screen feels incredibly reliable.--- Also, there are a TON of different displays to switch to, simple Analog & Digital ones, as well as ones with more information and customizable ones into which you can insert pictures. This all feels great.- Size & Design are very appealing - the screen does not feel too large even for my girlfriend - it is the perfect size.- Sleep tracking with heart rate monitoring & REM tracking also feels pretty accurate. There is also an option to monitor night-time breathing rate, but that consumes more battery so I have not checked that off yet._:CONS:_- Firstly, as it goes with many electronics and apps, it feels like you are signing your life and naming rights of your firstborn child away upon setup, but there is an easy-to-find option in the section ""Profile->About this app"" to ""Revoke Authorization"" if you change your mind on how much data is collected.- Alarm app only allows you to ""snooze"" one time, then the alarm will not go off again until the next day, so you may need to set multiple alarms if you sleep through your first one, like I often do.- I cannot find out how to change the distance units from the default km; you are able to change the weather units from C to F, but I have not yet found the option to toggle km to miles if it exists.- Hiking & Walking programs: I do not believe there is a difference between these at all; this is not so much of a complaint, but on my older GPS-tracking watches, both programs would track your route. In addition, Hiking would also include changes in altitude, which I very much liked. So color me slightly disappointed to find, at the end of my hike, hills had not been accounted for. Again, minor thing overall, but that would have been nice to be included in the workout summary._:NEUTRALS:_- In regards to the app, it is overall easy to use and find things.- One odd thing is that the ""Workout"" section only contains 5 icon at the top (Outdoor running, Walking, Outdoor cycling, Treadmill & Jump Rope), but there are a TON more on the actual watch for other activities (aerobic / weight-training / swimming / etc.), just as a FYI...- (not the company's fault) but aftermarket it definitely lighter for bands than other mainstream smartwatches - I've gotten a couple cool magnetic claps ones around the $10 - $15 mark that are well worth it though.OVERALL, for under a hundred bucks, this definitely feels like the best tracker out there in terms of functionality, battery life, and usefulness. I consider myself pretty critical and my caveats are not even impactful enough to remove a star. Also, my girlfriend still raves about hers as well, so she still loves it and hasn't mentioned any of her own cons to me (and I have asked...).",5.0,Positive,"['buy', 'replace', 'galaxy', 'watch',

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"Battery life is great and the, the face options are fun and plenty, and it feels comfortable on my wrist. My only star removal is due, in part, to the app. It's required to run all the time on the phone and it seems to eat the battery life. The battery lasts a long time, regardless, but that also means it can take a long time to charge back up when you need to. I used to charge my Fitbit watches (plural, thanks for crappy quality) while showering. I can't really do that with this unless I leave it charging after the shower is complete. No big deal, however, as it otherwise remains on my wrist all other times of the day.I was not expecting the app to properly sync with my Trainwell fitness app but, surprisingly, it did. It even had the GPS information and a lot of metrics during the run. I didn't even have to do anything to get Trainwell to see the run, it just sucked it right in like me with donuts!I will point out one annoyance, and I'm not 100% sure this is the watch and not Android, but whenever I have a voicemail waiting for me, any time the phone receives signal, where it didn't have signal before, the watch will buzz and show a notification for the pending voicemail. Between my office and parking spot, if there's a VM I know about it at least 3-times during my walk. I looked for a way to turn off certain apps from sending notifications, but either I got distracted or I couldn't find a way to restrict them. It also wants me to let it connect all the time and run in the background, but their instructions for doing that on Android is outdated or doesn't work with my phone cause it never works and constantly tells me to do the app permissions.For an inexpensive fitness tracker and watch, I think the quality more than exceeds the price!",4.0,Positive,"['battery', 'life', 'great', 'face', 'option', 'fun', 'plenty', 'feel', 'comfortable', 'wrist', 'star', 'removal', 'due', 'part', 'application', 'require', 'run', 'time', 'phone', 'seem', 'eat', 'battery', 'life', 'battery', 'last', 'long', 'time', 'regardless', 'also', 'mean', 'take', 'long', 'time', 'charge', 'back', 'need', 'use', 'charge', 'fitbit', 'watch', 'plural', 'thanks', 'crappy', 'quality', 'shower', 'cant', 'really', 'unless', 'leave', 'charge', 'shower', 'complete', 'big', 'deal', 'however', 'otherwise', 'remain', 'wrist', 'time', 'dayi', 'expect', 'application', 'properly', 'sync', 'trainwell', 'fitness', 'application', 'surprisingly', 'even', 'global positioning system', 'information', 'lot', 'metric', 'run', 'didnt', 'even', 'anything', 'get', 'trainwell', 'see', 'run', 'sucked', 'right', 'like', 'donutsi', 'point', 'one', 'annoyance', 'im', 'sure', 'watch', 'android', 'whenever', 'voicemail', 'wait', 'time', 'phone', 'receives', 'signal', 'didnt', 'signal', 'watch', 'buzz', 'show', 'notification', 'pending', 'voicemail', 'office', 'park', 'spot', 'there', 'vm', 'know', 'least', 'time', 'walk', 'looked', 'way', 'turn', 'certain', 'application', 'send', 'notification', 'either', 'get', 'distract', 'couldnt', 'find', 'way', 'restrict', 'also', 'want', 'let', 'connect', 'time', 'run', 'background', 'instruction', 'android', 'outdated', 'doesnt', 'work', 'phone', 'cause', 'never', 'work', 'constantly', 'tell', 'application', 'permissionsfor', 'inexpensive', 'fitness', 'tracker', 'watch', 'think', 'quality', 'exceeds', 'price']",battery life great face option fun plenty feel comfortable wrist star removal due part application require run time phone seem eat battery life battery last long time regardless also mean take long time charge back need use charge fitbit watch plural thanks crappy quality shower cant really unless leave charge shower complete big deal however otherwise remain wrist time dayi expect application properly sync trainwell fitness application surprisingly even global positioning system information lot metric run didnt even anything get trainwell see run sucked right like donutsi point one annoyance im sure watch android whenever voicemail wait time phone receives signal didnt signal watch buzz show notification pending voicemail office park spot there vm know least time walk looked way turn certain application send notification either get distract couldnt find way restrict also want let connect time run background instruction android outdated doesnt work phone cause never work constantly tell application permissionsfor inexpensive fitness tracker watch think quality exceeds price

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"This is the 4th generation of Mi Bands I've had, beginning with Mi Band 5. I didn't really like the size switch (I think they made it bigger in gen 8) - as I really liked the slim band that you hardly knew was there. But, I have to say this band feels awfully sleek. And I don't really notice it that much.The band is really soft - they also appear to have made it a little thicker. As I did break 2 or 3 bands over the years, this is probably a good thing.The auto brightness is an awesome new feature - it was always a pain to adjust the watch for different lighting. Overall the look and feel of the operating system is definitely improved. I assume the heart rate tracking is as stellar as ever - Mi Band has always excelled in that area, and been very close to Apple in terms of accuracy. There's a guy on youtube from Germany or Switzerland who has a great technical comparison of different heart rate trackers, and Xiaomi Mi Bands have always done really well there.Sleep tracking has always been not quite as good - but still a lot better than most. For people like me who just want to know ""hey how many hours did I get last night"" this band will undoubtedly be pretty spot on. Deep diving on your REM, etc - it probably won't rival the top trackers.The biggest problem with the Xiaomi ecosystem has always been how crappy their fitness app has been. I used a 3rd party app for a long time. But the newest incarnation of the Mi Fit app that goes with this watch appears to have finally gotten it right.

Xiaomi Redmi 5,"This is a nice functional watch. The plastic housing is a bit chunky compared to other aluminum models, but at this price that is to be expected. The screen is nice and bright. I have no problem reading it in the Arizona sun. The colors are vivid and lines are crisp. The display detects wrist tilt and turns on and off reliably when you lift your arm to read it. It syncs with my phone reliably and I get notifications on it as well. It was a bit of a pain to sort out the app permissions, but once that was done it works well. You can configure your home screen pages to include shortcuts to favorite activities, stats, music controls, timers, etc. There's a wide variety of faces available from minimalist to information overload. Battery life is great, with 5-7 days being standard for me. The factory strap is a bit of a pain to put on, but it uses standard watch straps with quick release pins, so any generic 22mm strap should fit. Heart rate and SpO2 monitoring seem accurate, and it detects activity well. There are a couple things I wish were different. Weight and height are in metric only, so if you're tracking weight loss you'll need to convert each time. The contacts for phone calls don't work. I can see my contacts, but the watch is unable to use them to dial a call. Manual keypad dialing does work though, oddly enough. There is no auto brightness on this model, so it can be a bit bright in dark rooms. It will sync night mode with local sunrise and sunset though, which helps. There are some cool geared/steampunk style mechanical faces available, but they are static. Outside of analog hand movement, there are no animations available.

Xiaomi Redmi 5,"First, this is a great budget-friendly active smart watch. The large LCD display is very nice, and I appreciated the different display options you could use. It's very easy to use and set up. My main reason for getting this watch was for running. I tested this product for a week, and due to my needs, it was not sufficient (aka tracking my run).In regards to running, it took a while to acquire the GPS, and while running, I was consistently notified of a 'low signal'. I have a running partner, and we would compare our data, and it was not the same. The majority of my runs will track the mileage, but it cannot track the location (aka provide the map visual [Strava]) due to the 'low signal'. Also, if you are from the US, this device uses the metric system (e.g., kilometers), and you cannot change it (I tried).

Also, the auto detection of workouts just takes too long to detect that you are working out.  But, the step counting, GPS, heart rate, SPO2, music control, phone functions all are very good.
