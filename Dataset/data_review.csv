Amazfit Bip 6,"I purchased this watch to replace a dead Samsung Galaxy watch.I've been pleasantly surprised with the functionality for the price. This watch will display and respond to messages, answer calls, track workouts, and more. I'm extremely surprised by the battery life. Wearing this watch for a week and the battery is only 50%. No more charging every night. A long with the great features you get a stylish and comfortable watch. Easy to read no matter the light.I would absolutely recommend this for anyone who wants the modern convenience of a smart watch for a fraction of the name brand price.",5.0
Amazfit Bip 6,"Pleasantly surprised. Finally, a less expensive watch that does everything, and more, than my Fitbit did. It has all the features I used on Fitbit for half the cost. The battery is better as well. I also like the larger face size. Being able to customize the watch face to my specific needs was essential, and I can do this with this watch. I did have to buy a program to do that, but it was well worth the $20. Facemaker is the name of the program if other's want to do the same. I get a full week use out of the battery with 4 1 hour (average) workouts a week. I actually have about 20% left at the 1 week point. Heart rate seems to be accurate, although it only checks it once a minute (settable in the app). For workouts it seems to display heart rate in real time which I care about more than when I am not working out. The app that the watch uses is pretty good. It actually provides a LOT more information than I care about. The only thing I have found that I wish was better is having the ability to edit the workout face. You can edit the data and where that data displays, but you can't edit the size of each data display. I would really like to be able to do this. Even better would be the ability to edit the workout face in the app, as opposed to only on the watch. I have only had this a couple of weeks so there may be more I discover that I like or dislike. I will update if needed, but for now I can fully recommend this watch as a valid replacement for much higher priced watches.",5.0
Amazfit Bip 6,"If you’re looking to purchase a smart watch that is affordable and it has all the bills and whistles other smart watches have then check this out. If you have an android or an iPhone, no worries this watch is actually compatible with both. You can also monitor your heart rate, steps taken and so much more. Setting up the watch is really easy and they connect via Bluetooth. Since I love working out, this is one of the features that I really enjoyed. It has more than 140 workouts something that the other smart watches do not have and it’s at a fraction of the cost, which makes it even better. There’s also an app that you can download that allows you to monitor your food intake. One of the great functions that this watch has is the ability to make and receive phone calls as well as text messages. A battery life on the watch is amazing. You can get up to 14 days depending on your usage. This is something I was not able to accomplish with my other smart watch.",5.0
Amazfit Bip 6,"This watch does well, considered the price. The functions and capabilities are pretty good. The watch face is a nice size for those who need larger texts. The band width is a bit snug. I wish they'd offer larger bands. My major squarm is the battery life when active. The watch has to be charged every four days. My Fitbit would last well over a week before it needed a charge. I do like that you can text and answer calls from your arm. The charging port could be a bit more user convenient. It was simple to connect this watch to my Android; it's compatible. Just make sure you go in to set the language to English. Also, you must download the app. I like the black color. The watch face is easily scratched though. I swam with it and it did well. Overall, it's a pretty decent watch.",4.0
Amazfit Bip 6,"This watch is amazing quality for the price! I have smart watches from all the major competitors and this one is actually better than all of them. The long battery life is a huge reason why I love this watch. I have had it on for weeks and it’s still at 1/2 battery level. It’s functional and has everything that you could want in a smart watch, and more. You can get all your notifications on this watch, GPS, make phone calls, and send replies. It has so many health tracking features like different workout modes, sleep metrics, blood oxygen, stress, and heart rate. It’s user friendly and easy to see notifications on the display, even in bright daylight. It is water resistant and very durable. I tend to break the screen of my other watches and this one is holding up strong! It even offers AI coaching for fitness. You can choose from tons of face watches to match your personal style. The screen size looks a little large for my small wrist but it doesn’t feel bulky when on. Overall this watch is amazing. If you are looking to get a smart watch I would definitely recommend this one; yes even over the leading brands. Oh and there is no subscription fee!",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"This thing blows away the Fitbit Versa 2, and the Garmin.  Very quick and easy to set up.  Quite accurate with your steps, which is important to me.  Heart rate is on point, and there are tons of extra features.  You can set it up for almost any type of exercise that you do.  From walking on the treadmill, to walking outside.  Running, strength training, lap swimming, elliptical, rowing machine, you name it.  The weather is accurate on this as well.  It's just a beautiful watch.  For the rest of us, we don't need that Apple watch with the high price tag.  This watch is superior, and the price is right.  Another bonus, the charge lasts for days.  I need to charge mine tonight, after not charging it for 9 days.  This brand will forever be my go to.  I research EVERYTHING thoroughly, and after having bought a Garmin to give it a go, that thing was a hunk of junk.  I came across this one, read the reviews, and felt confident with my purchase.  You will not be sorry you bought this.  I can't tell you how many people I've told about this watch.",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"An Impressive Smartwatch with Incredible Battery Life!I’ve been using Apple Watch for a long time, but I decided to try the Amazfit Active 2, and it was an amazing experience! The first thing that impressed me was the battery life – it actually lasts for 10 days without needing daily charging. This is a huge plus for those who don’t want to worry about charging all the time.All the trackers work flawlessly: sleep monitoring, heart rate tracking, and sports modes – everything is accurate and reliable. The watch is comfortable, lightweight, and stylish, fitting perfectly on the wrist. The built-in GPS maps with navigation are a great bonus, making workouts and travel easier.I’m really happy with my purchase and can confidently recommend this smartwatch to my friends and acquaintances. If you’re looking for a smartwatch with long battery life, high-quality tracking, and great functionality, the Amazfit Active 2 is definitely worth considering!",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I bought this watch in black when I started getting into fitness and wanted to track my sleep and workouts - and honestly, I’m really impressed! It looks so elegant on the wrist, and the quality feels amazing.There are so many useful features - one workout function alone has multiple training modes where you can track calories, plus detailed sleep tracking, notifications, and even a flashlight. I didn’t expect it to be this good - it truly feels like a quality purchase.The watch face is a bit on the larger side, so it feels slightly more masculine and may be better suited for men - but I still really enjoy using it. Even though it’s a bit big for me, the strap adjusts perfectly and makes it comfortable to wear.Funny enough, I forgot I had it on and accidentally took a shower with it - but nothing happened! The watch was totally fine. It even has a water cleaning mode, which is such a smart touch. Highly recommend!",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I’ve been using the Zepp Watch, and it’s been a solid addition to my routine. It tracks everything—steps, heart rate, sleep, and workouts—without feeling bulky on my wrist. The battery lasts for days, and it syncs smoothly with the app via Bluetooth and WiFi. I also love that it’s water-resistant, making it perfect for active days.Only downside? The app could be more user-friendly, and I’d like more watch face options. But overall, it’s a great fitness watch with reliable tracking and a sleek design",4.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I recently discovered the Amazfit ecosystem, and I have to say—I’m thoroughly impressed. I picked up both the Amazfit watch and smart ring, and from the moment I started using them, it was clear I found something special.The hardware is top-notch: stylish, comfortable, and packed with features that rival premium competitors. Both devices offer accurate health tracking, great battery life, and seamless connectivity. What truly sets Amazfit apart, though, is the Zepp app. It’s intuitive, beautifully designed, and gives in-depth insights into everything from sleep to stress and activity levels.For the price, this ecosystem delivers an incredible amount of value. I honestly didn’t expect this level of performance and polish in this price range. Amazfit has absolutely earned a",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"Great smartwatch that is easy to navigate and responsive to touch.  It is very lightweight which was a little worrisome.  My previous smartwatch was a Garmin Fenix 6 which is heavier and rugged.  It looks great, has a bright screen, and paired easily with my Google Pixel 6 Pro phone.  The only concerns/issues I have are: (1) because the watch is so lightweight, I'm concerned about it durability...definitely would not wear it in the garage while fixing things; (2) when paired with Pandora music app, the watch vibrates/notifies me every time the song changes no matter if its via my phone or car...I hope that maybe a setting change can fix this.  Overall, great smartwatch for normal everyday life and workouts but probably not the one for extreme sports and in the garage wear.",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I’ve bought at least five other smartwatches over the years to monitor my health and fitness—but none have come close to what the Amazfit Active 2 delivers. The features, accuracy, display quality, and battery life are outstanding.Honestly, I wish I had found this 7 years ago. It would’ve saved me time, money, and frustration. I wholeheartedly recommend this watch to anyone aged 18 and above—whether you're just starting your fitness journey or are already active.I have no words to fully express how happy I am to have finally found the watch that works the way I always hoped one would. Simply amazing!",5.0
Amazfit T-Rex 3,"So far, after using the watch for a week now, I am impressed.  I've used other smart watches and this has been the best so far.  Seems some of the difficulties I've experienced with watches in the past are better with this T Rex 3.BT connectivity is better. No issues linking up to my phone.  And when loosing connectivity due to distance or such, the watch and the Zepp app seem to reconnect very well.  I do not, and have not had to go through any BT reconnect process since my first pairing.The heart rate monitor seems much more reliable than other watches.  The sleep pattern and logging of such seems very accurate and reliable as well.  As with most watches, lots of functions and apps I'll never use, but the ones I do use, seem to work well.I like the excersize tracker functions.  One of the features I never thought about, but once playing around with it, I have found it very useful in incorporating into my routine.I did notice the compass and GPS all seemed to calibrate and function much quicker and with more accuracy with this T Rex 3.  I was pleased with that result.  The mapping feature is working and kind of interesting.  Not a feature I've used before, but can see where it could be worthy of trying.The ability to use phone, SMS and such works well, with replies and messaging working well paired with my Samsung Galaxy.In general, typical features found on this watch all seem to work as advertised.  The Zepp app has many, many features which seem to be interesting, but haven't yet played around with.  No issues with downloading or pairing or data updates from the watch.  All in all, seems like Amazfit and Zepp work very well together.As with most smart watches, the navigation through its apps and functions can be ""trial and err"", but I find this watch to be very near others and no more difficult while being and very similar to others.  The Zepp app can be intrusive with permission requests and such, but always having, and giving  the option to allow or deny.  All depends on what the user finds useful or not.Watch itself is very lite on my wrist.  I'm not a big fan of the band, more like a plastic, silicone band, but works fine, just not my preference.  Display is very nice and bright, clear and crisp. Battery seems to be working as advertised as well.  Vibration intensity and volume of the watch is beyond sufficient.All in all, very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this watch.  Don't have any real downsides to it yet.  In using this watch and considering it's cost, I can't image why anyone would spend more for other watches.  Seems this watch is very near perfect with all the bells and Whistles anyone would need at a reasonable price.",5.0
Amazfit T-Rex 3,"First of all, I used to work for a major smartwatch company (which will remain nameless) writing manufacturing test software and running the data analytics team.  Thus, I was very much involved in the device data set uploaded to the cloud and the creation of device diagnostics, usability, and user preference analytics for our marketing and engineering departments.  From this point of view, I was very intimate with all the internal device components and how our devices were utilized by our users.I would have to say that this T-Rex3 watch blows away any of the smartwatches I have seen in my previous company at a reasonable price point.  It even has more comprehensive feature set than I have seen on my Garmin Venu 2 which I use everyday for my workouts.  I wore both the Venu 2 and T-Rex3 on a long hike and the health and workout numbers were very close.  Been using this Venu 2 for 4 years now almost everyday and I consider this to be the gold standard for GPS accuracy.I cannot stress how much battery longevity is a high priority to me as I know many users do not want to charge their devices daily as people forget and it is a hassle.  I personally make my smartwatch purchase decision starting with how long the battery will last.  BTW, I also owned an Apple Watch in the past and I stopped using it as I would forget to charge it daily, rendering it useless to me.Pros- Excellent battery life, almost 2 weeks using the GPS daily every day for at least 1 hour in myworkouts.  I believe the battery can run longer without such heavy GPS usage.-  Cost to own.  You will not find a better, more comprehensive smartwatch at this price point.-  I have proven its GPS and health feature set accuracy-  I like that it can capture Beidou GPS signals as I travel to Asia frequently-  Large high resolution color screen for my old eyes to see everything clearly-  Comprehensive set of watch faces, some free but some you must purchase-  Comfortable enough for me to wear 24/7 to enable me to collect sleep data-  Most of the settings and features like notifications are pretty standard for today's smartwatches-  Durability of this device to meet military standards suggests it should last...time will tellCons- It is a large watch, but it fits me.  42mm is my ideal size, but some may find it too big.- Very functional design, not the prettiest, but also not the ugliest- Appeals primarily to men which locks out 50% of the market who wants this feature set- Zepp app is average at best.  For instance, I cannot track the mileage on my running shoes like on theGarmin app.  I still like the Garmin app better.",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I’m really happy with my Amazfit Active 2. The design is sleek and premium, and I love that it comes with both a leather and a sport strap — it’s super convenient to switch depending on the occasion. The battery lasts several days without needing a charge, and the GPS and heart rate tracking are very accurate. Sleep tracking also works surprisingly well. Overall, great value for the price and a perfect balance between style and functionality.",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I’ve been using this smartwatch for a few weeks now, and I’m truly impressed. The design is sleek and elegant, with a classic watch face that makes it look like a luxury timepiece rather than a typical smartwatch. The black strap is comfortable and adjustable, and the display is clear and easy to read even in daylight.I love how it shows both the analog and digital time, and it even displays the date clearly. The interface is responsive, and syncing with my phone was fast and easy. I mainly use it to track my steps, check messages, and keep an eye on the time — and it does all of that reliably.Battery life has been great so far — it lasts several days on a single charge. I also appreciate that it’s lightweight, so I can wear it all day without discomfort.Overall, it’s a perfect blend of style and smart features. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a classy smartwatch that doesn’t look overly technical.",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"Why did you pick this product vs others?:​I already own the amazfit active midnight black and i love it. But when i saw that this came out with the Sapphire glass and stainless steel bezel i had to have it. It is so beautiful and strong. Very good quality, nice leather band and very nice red sports band comes with it. The only thing is that the battery runs out too soon. I actually disabled several things so it could last upto 10 days. . The watch faces that come with this watch are so beautiful. It is has a bright screen and looks very good. Very affordable, very comfortable. Heart rate and sleep and other apps work very well. The only things i would change about it is a longer lasting battery and at least upto 2gbs of storage space (comes with 1gb storage) to add more stuff in the watch like music and watch faces. All in all, i love it anyway! Amazfit is Awesome!",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I went with the leather band and higher quality glass and I’m glad I did.  It looks great and much more high end than it is.  There are many more free watch faces than Fitbit ever offered.  The design is classic and timeless which is a must for me.I really wanted to LOVE this watch after wearing Fitbits for years.  I just like it.  That’s because the battery life isn’t close to the 10 day claim.  Have to charge it just as often as my Fitbits and when it gets low it’s just GONE.The number of apps is overwhelming!  That could be a good thing until you realize that every app significantly shortens battery life. Their Premium upgrade is completely worthless because all it gives you is a few more Sleep Details and access to meditative music to play on your wrist, which drains the battery in a few hours and sounds awful.",4.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I absolutely loved this smartwatch! The Amazfit Active 2 is not only packed with useful features, but it’s also incredibly stylish. The black leather strap and sapphire glass give it a sleek, premium look — it feels like a luxury accessory, not just a fitness tracker. It’s surprisingly lightweight and very comfortable to wear all day, even when I sleep. The battery life is amazing, and I love tracking my steps, heart rate, and workouts without needing to charge it constantly. Truly a great buy!",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"Prior to this smartwatch, I was an Apple Watch or whoop only user. I HATED that I couldn’t get 24 hours of use on the Apple Watch to track sleep and other health monitoring and hated not getting notifications from whoop. This watch is a third of the price (or less), has amazing battery life - only using about 10% per day (normal use - alerts, health monitoring), looks great, and has nice faces.Would like to see more simplistic digital faces and the ability respond to iOS texts but that’s not Amazfits problem, Apple won’t open it up for use. The health tracking seems accurate and I love the readiness score (similar to whoop recovery score). Straps are cheap - but they’ve gotta save on costs somewhere.I’m sold on Amazfit! Buy it!!!",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"Was hoping amazfit would come out with an elegant watch, so jumped at the chance to buy this when it came out. I own two other amazfit watches. The functionality this watch offer is quite, well, amazing, especially for the price. The problem is look and feel. The stainless steel does not look like stainless steel at all, but rather powder coated material of unknown composition. The glass bezel has a strange curve to it, which makes it look spacey, kind of Google pixel like. Some people may like that, but the glass has some kind of strange coating that makes it look cloudy all the time. You can wipe it off, but it’ll look cloudy again quickly, and it holds finger oils terribly.  This causes a weird reflection off the glass.  The leather band is thin and cheap. It is also quite narrow. overall good concept here just poor execution.",3.0
Amazfit Active 2,"Wow! Pleasantly surprised. Amazing value, nice looking, very easy to set and use. Accepted a phone call on it and the sound quality was an A+. It’s thin, light, beautiful display. Very pleased with this purchase. The only note of caution, I’m a decent size guy and have the band/s near the max setting. So if you have a large wrist you may need an alternate band.",5.0
Amazfit Gtr Mini Smart Watch,"I have had this watch for a few months at this point. I have used a ton of different cheaper watches, and the accompanying apps. This one by far is beyond the others. First the watch faces are customizable you can use a large variety of free ones, you can purchase more in the app or you can use the custom watch face builder to create your own. The tracking of everything works well. I don't use any of the paid services, but there is plenty of information available for someone who is mildly interested in tracking sleep quality, steps, exercise, water consumption, activity levels, etc. More importantly for me, it sends me notifications, answers calls, has voice assistant, and tracks all of the above. It stays charged for an entire workweek. I charge it on my day off when I am just relaxing, then I am good to wear it consistently for the next week. I have eyed the pixel watch on and off, but the darn higher end watches don't stay charged long enough. So if you are not looking for a doctor on your wrist that gives perfectly accurate data this is a good choice. It seems pretty accurate for what I use it for, and I don't base medical decisions off the data, other than maybe saying I don't think I am getting enough sleep sometimes. If the pixel watch eventually can match battery life might try that out someday, but until then this is the brand for me. Oh and unlike all the other cheaper ones, this app stays connected and reconnects when it is back in range, I never lose my sleep or steps data because I forgot to link the app at exactly 11:59 at night, or ever. The only time I don't get data is when I am not wearing the watch.***update April 2025***This watch is still working fantastically. I work in a commercial kitchen, I am sometimes elbow deep in a sink full of dishes or covered to my elbows in degreaser, oil, sanitizer, or food of some sort. When I am just prepping food I will usually pull my glove up over the watch, but otherwise it is exposed to the abuse of the elements in the kitchen. Most of the watches I have used before seem to fall apart after a few months in the kitchen. I think some of the chemicals we use dissolve the glue that holds the face to the body of the watch. This one still looks brand new. There is a warning somewhere in the instructions to not expose this to prolonged hot water, the thing is I can't stop what I am doing to take my watch off, so I had resigned myself to just purchasing new watches when the old one broke. And if this one eventually falls apart I will replace it with the newest model of the exact same watch. The app for this watch just works. It tries to sell me upgrades every couple weeks but they aren't necessary to keep track of steps or sleep or anything else really. It still connects automatically whenever in range of my phone, and I do not have to think about it at all. I can ignore the app for weeks at a time and still go back and look at the data whenever I want. And when I am feeling like I want something new I just switch out the band. It is so nice to be able to view my messages when I am elbow deep in a giant batch of bread. For me this watch takes the abuse that I never expected it to, I have given up on the more expensive brands... They are never going to compare especially when it comes to battery life.",5.0
Amazfit Gtr Mini Smart Watch,"Pros:1. Sleep tracking is nice and more than I expected. It provides daily trends on sleep habits, including the time frames of REM, Deep Sleep and Light Sleep (all shown in separate parts in the same graph). Love this, and didn't expect I would use it, but I do. It reminds me to go to bed based on a goal. Provides sleep grades compared to others and this goal. And it has been successful in helping me track my overall sleep health, and to develop better sleep habits. This was an unexpected perk for me.2. Setup of the watch and the Zepp app was so much more painless than the initial watch I purchased and its app. It synced up quickly and correctly. The app started reporting, and transferring over to the Apple Health app right away once I got it all set up. It did take some figuring out how to get the Apple Health synced up, but that was a complexity issue more on the Apple side.3. The battery life is really good. I typically only have to charge every 3-4 days. Am very happy with the battery life considering how much I use the watch.4. The watch provides a wide array of health stats including the already described Sleep, Stress, Heart Rate, Blood Oxygen, Steps, Activities, Exercise, Calories, distance, and provides a PAI score each day that took a little to understand, but I now find very useful to just ""summarize"" if I'm staying active and healthy each day. I especially love the blood oxygen reading which I track every hour because I suffer from asthma that is allergy and autoimmune-related. I can now track when I might need to pay closer attention and ""take a puff"" before it gets really bad. I don't know how accurate this all is, but the readings make enough sense to be useful in tracking my overall systematic health, and I find that very useful overall.5. I know I have only ""unlocked"" and used half of this watch and Zepp watch's abilities. There is also geolocation capacities, which I look forward to using on a hike or outdoor activities.6. I also like the tap button on the side, and the many possibly configurations you can set up to customize how you interact with the watch. It's easy to push because it sticks out, unlike some other smartwatches that you have to push just right. I use my tap button for 1) short tap to access all the apps (and you can buy or download free apps - this is also nice), 2) long tap to wake my watch. I just love the flexibility in setting up the watch to fit your own needs and preferences.7. My texts and messages from iMessage on my iPhone and WhatsApp come through with no issues. I like getting those notifications on my watch and then going to my phone to read the message. The text is previewed on the watch, but any attachments, I have to go to my phone.8. I get reminders from my calendars (Google, Apple, Work) on the watch. I like that a lot.9. The weather app is standard in look and data. Nice to have.10. You can scroll down on each app and screen, and the watch drills down to a lot detailed information. Love this. The amount of details is great (even for the weather).11. Also have alarming options. I can set alarms on my watch for daily activities.12. I love the round watch face as opposed to the square or rectangular face. It's aesthetically a beautiful watch.Cons:1. Pricier than other smartwatches, but cheaper than Apple and other high end watches. For the price, I think it has a lot. So not sure this is a con. It's more than I wanted to spend. :)2. There is so much it took a few days to set it all up the way I finally wanted it, and some were not intuitive. I even have MORE to set up, just haven't.3. I may have missed it, but they have a stopwatch. Would be nice to have a Timer.4. The watch will notify you of incoming calls and missed calls, but does not allow you to make calls, nor is there voicemail on the watch. I don't miss this actually because I usually have my phone with me too. I get the notification on the phone, and I then know to call someone back or listened to voicemail of a missed call.Overall, I am very pleased with this watch. It does what is advertised. Other than a bit lengthy and complex set up, it's primarily an activities, health tracking with some daily management watch. And I am finding that's really all I need it for. My goal of developing healthier habits is helped significantly along with this watch.",5.0
Amazfit Band 7,"Searched widely for heart rate, pace, distance wrist monitor for getting back to running after being off for a few years.  Bought Garmin Insight  2 years ago but could never figure out how to use it!  WAY too complicated.  I didn't need email, texts, weather, and the screen was impossible to read in sunlight.  Plus it was $250.  Saw the Amazfit Band 7 and thought I'd try it.  Absolutely perfect!!  Does exactly what I need, super bright screen, battery lasts multiple days, able to delete apps that I never use so it's really simple.  Get full tracking data from my runs that go into an Excel spreadsheet.  YAY!  Super good price.  Band was really a pain but then found alternatives on Amazon,  Just pop out the watch and push into the new band.  Perfect.",5.0
Amazfit Band 7,"I was skeptical at first - how could a $45 device be this good ?  Well, I was wrong.  The watch is great and does everything that I was looking for, and a few more benefits that I was not.  My main goal was fitness and sleep tracking but without all the complex intrusion (and cost) of an Apple Watch - if this is you then please read on.First - the watch is very easy to set up and connect with your phone. The navigation on the watch can be a little touchy, but it works well enough.I have been using for 3 weeks now and find no problems or issues that would keep me from highly recommending this brand to others !At some point, I may look for an alternative band (there are many) but for me this was a great purchase.",5.0
Amazfit Band 7,"Decent product for the price but has some obvious flaws.The Amazfit works pretty well, but there are some issues with it:1) The wrist band is weak. It will come undone relatively easily -- which is an issue for an exercise ""work out tracking"" watch.  If you are jogging or sprinting there's a good chance it will come loose and fall off.I've remedied this by buying an alternative wrist band, but this feels like a basic design flaw that should not be there.2) The Zepp App used to control/read data from the watch is clunky and confusing.  It's not AWFUL, but could be a bit more intuitive.3) There is no alarm and the watch cannot set off an alarm on your phone.  It's wake up signal is to vibrate.  Why can't it get my phone to play a jingle along with the vibrtation seeing as it's already linked to my phone?It works pretty well...just has some annoying flaws",4.0
Amazfit Band 7,"Honestly would not recommend this watch at all.First, the heart rate monitor and sleep monitor are very inaccurate. I compared the heart rate measurement several times during various levels of rest or exercise with the readings from my blood pressure arm cuff. While I was expecting some inaccuracies maybe plus or minus a few bpm the watch would report 90 bpm when my blood pressure device read 130 bpm and when my blood pressure cuff read 90 this would often read anywhere from 70 to 140. Sometimes tapping the measure button would read 130 and then 2 seconds later read 80.Second, the device has a feature where if you press and hold the screen you can quickly change the watch face. This is extremely annoying as the screen is extremely sensitive and I found if my coat sleeve slid forward it would trigger it, or if I crossed my arms it would trigger it, or just resting my arms in my lap would trigger it. There is no way to disable this feature and with how sensitive the screen is to any kind of touch from anything it gets very frustrating very quickly.Finally, most of these issues could still be overlooked to an extent but after having it for only about four months the screen popped out on me and was dangling by the ribbon cable connecting it to the circuit board. I carefully set the screen back in place and glued it back in using a compound that would seal it from moisture so it wouldn't get damaged further but that didn't last long. I glued it once more with some heavy duty glue but that also failed after about a month. The third time it popped out and I glued it back in the screen had solid white vertical lines so I popped the screen out and discovered parts of the wiring on the ribbon cable had cracked due to the screen hanging freely by it. Now, with no functional screen whatsoever I am unable to turn the device off at all since there is no physical way to turn it off without using the screen. Thankfully I was at least able to turn my alarms off through the Zepp app so it would stop buzzing when sitting on my desk.Overall, this thing is cheap garbage and I wouldn't waste a penny on it. Only reason I give it 1 star is you can't give it 0 and my mom likes it cause she has metal allergies and this is the first fitness tracker she's found that does not have any metal against the skin.",1.0
Amazfit Active Smart Watch 42Mm,"I've had several Amazfit watches over the years. My current favorite is the GTR4 (round, feature-packed, nice looking watch). I had always wanted to get the GTS4 (the square version) for a second choice, but couldn't bring myself to spend the money for it (It was around $150 at the time - still a good price, but I felt guilty, since the GTR4 was already so great!). Then the Amazfit Active came along for $84, so I decided to get it. I'm so happy I did. I got the black color, but it comes in a few more. I love the watch! It's super lightweight and feels great on my wrist. I even like the fold under strap - nice and neat. This little watch is pretty much the GTS4 minus a few features. It doesn't have a barometer or altimeter (but it does have a compass), no automatic brightness, and no camera remote (I think you can actually get one if you pay for an app). There isn't storage space on the watch for music, which doesn't bother me, since I don't store music on my GTR4, anyway. Other than that, I can't think of any features it doesn't have that my other watch does; and for everyday use, I don't miss those features. There is a single flat button on the side (no rotating crown), and I think it makes this watch look more sleek and compact. There are a ton of free watch faces, and the app store with many of the same apps as I have on the GTR4. The vibration is strong enough to wake me when I'm sleeping. The speaker is not quite as loud as the GTR4, but loud enough for telephone calls. Texting has the added feature of using a tiny keyboard to type responses, which I've actually been able to do when my phone was charging, so a pretty cool feature. The GPS is accurate. I believe it can do some of the same navigation that the GTR4 does (primitive map display, bread crumbs, return route), but I don't know how big of a route you can store on it, since I haven't used that feature (I'd take the larger watch with the extra memory on a hike). The heartrate, steps, sleep tracking, blood O2, and other health features are the same as the GTR4. The display, while smaller, is still easy to read and contains all the information you need in texts, health data, etc. Battery life is very good. I average about 10 days with moderate GPS use (walks or bike rides in my neighborhood, an hour at a time, three or four days a week). All in all, this is a great watch, and I'm happy I decided on this rather than the GTS4 (By the way, as of this writing, the GTS4 is $129!). I highly recommend this watch, and the Amazfit brand in general.",5.0
Amazfit Active Smart Watch 42Mm,"I honestly didn’t expect to love this watch as much as I do. I got the Amazfit Active during a deal, and for the price, it’s a total win.It looks sleek, feels super light on the wrist, and the display is bright and clear—even in the sun. It’s been perfect for tracking steps, sleep, and even controlling my music while I cook. The system runs smoothly and is very easy to use.The battery life is solid, and it charges quickly too. I’ve been wearing it daily and it hasn’t disappointed. If you want a smartwatch that looks good and does the job without costing a fortune, this one’s a no-brainer",5.0
Amazfit Active Smart Watch 42Mm,"The Amazfit Active is an affordable smartwatch with lots of bells and whistles. I originally purchased the GTS 4, but found the stem was bulky and placed illogically with the slightest wrist bend taking me to the menu screen or rebooting itself. The Active is pretty much identical in shape and functionality but with a flat button making it less prone to accidental pushing by wrist movement and workout gloves.I am not wild about the silicone strap. It feels cheap and I'm having a hard time finding the right hole to ensure a decent fit on my small wrist. Amazfit makes a ""vegan leather"" strap for the pink watch it sells but I haven't found any replacement bands explicitly stating they fit the Active, which makes me hesitant to look for an aftermarket band.The app is okay, but for unknown reasons, some of the settings available with the GTS 4 don't seem to be available for the Active. For example, with the GTS 4, the app/watch was happy enough with the approximate location for displaying weather info. Not so for the Active. It annoys me it won't let me enter a zip code or an approximate location. The exercise/exercise settings feature is difficult to use and set up.  I haven't been able to find a way to customize strength training so I tried using the generic indoor fitness (or one of the other ones) but that, too, insisted on counting sets. I would think you could control at least some of the settings in the app but if there's a way, I haven't found it. My last gripe with the app is it reminds me every time I open the app functionality may be limited if I don't give it full access to everything it wants to access. I know this and I don't care. I CHOOSE TO TURN OFF SOME OF THE PERMISSIONS. Yet every single time I open the app, I have to select GOT IT and then exit out of the permissions settings on my phone.If you don't need a NAMED watch, the Amazfit Active has a nice design, good performance, great battery life and decent price point.",4.0
Amazfit Active Smart Watch 42Mm,"Not needing to constantly charge this is HUGE!  It runs for about a week and half.  I can make and take calls, read and reply to messages too.  The app is easy to use and the settings are many.  I still dont know how to use all the features but it does many things without my help:  determines when I'm working out and traks time; follows my sleep very well; tell me to get up and walk, drink water.  The only thing I would like is a light colored background with tradition clock face in the options of many.  I love it.",5.0
Amazfit Balance Smart Watch 46Mm,"After my Pebble 2 SE started to wear down I switched over to the Amazfit Bip because at the time it was the only comparable smartwatch with similar battery life. Since then I upgraded to the GTS2e and now to the Balance. Needless to say I haven't found a reason to move away from Amazfit as I have always been happy with their watches.The most important feature for me is the battery life, I hate having one more thing to worry about charging if I travel or am away from a power source most of the day.  Though I have only been using the Balance for a few days, based on my experience so far I'm pretty confident you could go at least 7 days without needing a charge so long as you don't use the always on display or excessive GPS tracking.I have also enjoyed Amazfit's built in watch apps, they provide everything I need in a watch; notifications, the ability to take calls/respond to texts, a timer, alarm, and a find my mobile function that makes your phone ring when you misplace it.  The Balance also introduces an app store where additional apps can be downloaded. Its fairly limited compared to what is offered by Apple or Google, but its nice to have the option. The health tracking is just an added bonus in my book.As for the accuracy, I think it is accurate enough for what it is and can give you a good general sense of where your health metrics are at. It likely isn't as accurate as higher end fitness focused watches, but considering the cost, battery life, and user experience features it includes that are more akin to a traditional smart watch I think its a worthy compromise.The recent update to Zepp OS 3.5 has added its own built in AI assistant, Zepp Flow. It's nothing ground breaking, but it is nice to have and can make doing things like setting a timer, alarm, or starting a workout as easy as asking the watch to do it for you. It also includes Amazon Alexa which can be useful for controlling other smart home devices.Physically its very comfortable to wear, being thin and lightweight. I wear it all day and at night when sleeping without any issues whatsoever. The screen is also very vibrant and can get surprisingly bright which makes it easy to see even in direct sunlight. The included silicone watch strap is also comfortable and has a nice added feature. In the past I have had issues with silicone bands as the keeper that prevents the excess band from flopping around would wear down and allow the band to slip out, requiring me to constantly adjust it and slip it back in. The keeper on the included band has a small notch in it that allows it to plug into the last hole on the band so this should prevent it from slipping out in the future.Overall I think its a great watch for anyone that is looking for something in-between a dedicated fitness device and smart watch, it provides the best of both worlds at a reasonable price.",5.0
Amazfit Balance Smart Watch 46Mm,"I've had some heart issues for a long time and this past year, they've gotten to the point where I need to do closer monitoring. Then, in July, I had a loop monitor implanted. While it sends a reading to my cardiologist's office every night, I needed something that would alert me when my heart rate fell above or below the doctor's parameters for my situation. I did a lot of research into a lot of watches. I have a Galaxy S22 Ultra so looked at the Galaxy watches and tried one, but the battery life is terrible. I needed a watch that had a battery that would last more than 12 hours with constant heart monitoring. I was already using an Amazfit GTS 4 Mini and loved it, the battery lasted almost 14 days, but it had no alert for heart rate and also was missing a couple other things I wanted/needed, so after looking at so-many-watches, I decided to try the Balance. So here's my review.The watch is large. At least for me, but the screen is amazing! Clear, easy to read, Amoled so the color is great. I chose to use the 'use your own photo' watch face which is new (I think) for Amazfit and I like it. There are several others to choose from and if they stay true to form, more will be added. There are a lot of apps pre-loaded on the watch and a lot to choose from to load so that would probably appeal to many who will use this for fitness. I do not so I can't speak to the fitness portion of the watch. I keep track of my steps/activity on the whole, but not any specific exercise. I got the watch on September 2nd, charged it, and with all of the heart associated apps turned on to run all the time (including running the heart rate monitor every 60 seconds,) I didn't have to charge it until the 11th, and even then, I was still at 18%, but we were going on vacation, so the battery life is great. Like I mentioned, the watch is huge, at least for me. It's 46mm, but light weight, so I don't really notice it much. It has a relatively slim profile on the wrist so I'm not banging into things with it like I thought I would. I did change the band to a stainless steel one because any silicone bands cause a rash for me. Those are the basics. Here's some of the pros and cons.PROS:Huge, clear, bright face that's easy to read, even for people who need glasses.Several watch faces to choose from including one you can personalize. Big plus!Heart/Health monitoring has been pretty accurate so far as tested at the cardiologist's officeSleep monitoring seems to be accurate, matching those times I wake during the nightWill follow DND on your phoneWill sync with Google Fit and a couple other third party health apps nowDifferent sounds per alerts so you know what alerts are coming in (can't change them though)Syncs well with Zepp app and changes on app are immediate on watchSilicone band will fit a 5-1/2"" to 10""+ wristCONS:NO ECG. None of the watches Amazfit sells in the US has ECG. That was the first question I asked them and from their response, for the foreseeable future, they will not have a watch in the US that has that.The winder is very large and really sits high on the watch. It has the potential to catch on things and does during the night so if you use DND and wear it to bed, it will catch on the sheets at some point, wake the watch, waking you.No tap-to-wake, which my GT4 Mini had and which I miss a lot. It will still 'lift to wake' if you set that, otherwise, you have to push the winder.Second button on the watch is for workout information which I don't use, but it's very flat and seems like it would be hard to use while very active.""Rotate the crown"" must mean the winder because the crown doesn't rotate and while the winder does, it only makes the face larger and not permanentlyTakes a 22mm watch band! Don't make the mistake of buying a 20mm which is a standard size.BEWARE! I went a whole day without getting any notifications. I reached out to Amazfit and they had no idea why I wasn't getting any either. Low and behold, there's an option called Cover To Mute. If that's checked and you're wearing a long sleeve shirt or sweater that covers the watch, you won't receive any notifications because the face is covered. Just letting you know!That's a flyover of the watch. On the whole, I like it. I've never been a big fan of the Zepp world. I'd be a lot happier if it was Android OS of course, but I understand their desire to work with either Android or Apple. They're getting smoother with the interaction between their OS and Android though. I'm sure I've missed a bunch, but this will give you a good idea at least.",5.0
Amazfit Refurbished Bip 3,I have had this fitness watch for a year and it works great - but i do question the sleep monitoring - sometimes it records that I slept 8 hrs but i only slept 6  or when i do sleep 8 hrs it says 5 or 6 - other than that i wear this all day and in the shower - no issues at all - App is easy to use and it also shows my text messages and alerts me when my ph rings - overall this is a great watch for the money - after a full charge it lasts about 10 or 12 days - highly recommend,5.0
Amazfit Refurbished Bip 3,"To frame this review, I'd like to point out that I purchased this entirely for sleep and exercise tracking and am using a normal digital wristwatch for normal watch functions.This thing has great battery life, looks sharp, and is a great size for readability.  The UI is fairly easy to use and the touchscreen is responsive.I haven't used all of the features but lets go over the ones that I have.SLEEP TRACKING:This is the first device I've used that does sleep tracking and it seems to do a good job of it.  The graphs are informative and it has helped me tighten up my sleep schedule automatically.  I'm not sure of the science behind how it detects different states of sleep but it seems to be at least somewhat accurate.  On days that show that I had more deep sleep, I certainly do feel more rested.MUSIC CONTROL:I use this to control my music or podcasts when working out.  It works great and includes all the buttons you would need for that.ALEXA:The Alexa feature works great using the built in microphone.  I do miss the built in speaker of the Bip 5 and the dedicated button that allow you to access this feature quickly but you can only fit so much into a small package.I use the Alexa feature regularly to set a quick countdown timer, a nap alarm, or to create reminders.  It has also been useful for settling debates quickly e.g. ""What quarterback has the most passing yards of all time"".WORKOUT TRACKING:I've only used this with stationary workouts on an exercise bike but it does a good job of tracking and graphing your workout.WEATHER:The built in weather app works well and includes sunrise/sunset data as well as a 7 day forecast.  It's good info at a glance but lacks detailed forecast information such as hourly forecasts.NOTIFICATIONS:The notifications system works well.  You opt-in to each service you'd like to receive notifications for and your band will vibrate when one comes in.  It's great at a glance.  You can deny calls from the watchface, and send preset text messages (that you can customize in the app) when rejecting the call.  I really wish they had programmed it to where you could respond to text messages with canned messages as well.  Simple ""Yes"", ""No"", ""I'm on the way"", ""Running late"" etc would be extremely helpful.APPS / WATCH FACES:I counted roughly 30 free watch faces in their app store.  The vast majority are paid options but I was able to find several free that suited me.There aren't a lot of apps to choose from and I didn't find anything in the app store that seemed useful to me in my daily life.POMODORO TIMER:This is a very simple feature but it can be life changing if you use it correctly.  Basically this is a timer where you alternate between focusing on a task and taking a break.  A popular setup is 25 minutes of focus followed by a 5 minute break.I regularly use this in my work to make sure that I stay on task, while not sitting on a single task so long that I am spinning tires.",5.0

Amazfit Refurbished Bip 3,"I decided I wanted to step away from my phone more but still wanted to know if any texts or calls came in while my phone was not next to me and so I started looking for a smart watch. Goodness. There’s a lot of cheap options but let me tell you - they don’t work! I bought three others before me this one, wasted so much time trying to figure them out and still they never actually worked. But this watch- ACTUALLY WORKS. For that, I’m happy. I wanted something smaller but since this is the only one that functions, I’ll deal with it. Now I get to put the phone away and see how it goes. This is day 1 so we will see but if that’s your reasoning to get a watch, choose this one and save yourself many headaches. Only negative thing I see is that there are very few free watch faces. Almost all of them cost money so that kind of stinks.",5.0
Amazfit Refurbished Bip 3,"UPDATE: I had such high hopes for this product (see original post below) but now that I have been using it for less than a month:1) I can no longer trigger it to come on through wrist activation-even after resetting etc2) The distance calculator for running is off by about .2 miles3) the brightness of the watch face (regardless of the background) has decreased overtime and nothing seems to be able to fix it4)  The watch is hit or miss in terms of activating it with touch so now not only does it not wrist activated, you never know if you will be able to activate it or not with touchOriginal POST: I have used several fitness trackers (Fitbit, Garmin) and recently got fed up with my Fitbit because I could never read the watch face if I was outside.  I wanted to try something new, but didn't want to spend a lot of money.  I like to use my fitness tracker for overall steps, calories and to see overall mileage during a run as well as overall calories burned during other workouts.  I decided to get a refurbed Amazfit as the price was incredible.  Here is what I LOVE about the watch and a few comments about what I will need to get used to:LOVE-there are so many watch faces to chose from, and everyone I have tried makes it so easy to see the information no matter where I am-love the look of this watch, it's a bigger face than my old Fitbit and I think the design is excellent-battery life is great-it was so easy to set up and the app is easy to navigate-love all the different workout options that are included, I swim a lot in the summer and it was fun to track it-just love it overallGETTING USED TO-it presents calories as Kcals and there is no way to change this, so I am learning how to convert to regular calories burned, a little annoying but considering how much I love the watch overall, not a big dealAfter two days with my Amazfit, I can't imagine ever using a Fitbit again.  Even if the watch lasts only a year (hopefully not the case) at less than $40 it was a great purchase.",1.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I was so hesitant to buy this because the reviews on smartwatches are always all over the place and I don’t want to regret my purchase. I don’t regret my purchase at all!! I previously had multiple different Fitbits and this watch blows them all out of the water! My latest Fitbit kept automatically disconnecting from my Bluetooth so I wouldn’t get my phone notifications - a feature that I had come to rely on. Fitbit customer service said it was because I wasn’t manually syncing my device in the app enough (1-2 times per day wasn’t sufficient, according to them, which is just absurd). I never had to do that with previous models and decided I was fed up. Not only can I confirm that this device stays connected to Bluetooth, but it does so without me even opening the app to sync the device, just like my older model Fitbits did. Sweet relief! It also gives the option to receive notifications from many different apps on your phone (social media, security camera apps, etc). And that’s not all! The battery life on this thing is amazing! I charge it every time I take a shower so it never goes below 90%. I tested it the first few days by not charging it and, by my calculations, it would have lasted around 8 days before needing to be charged with every single health screening feature turned ON! That’s incredible!! The display is gorgeous and the auto-workout tracker is extremely accurate. The only thing I will say is that I do think my Fitbit tracked my sleep better. There was one night that I was very restless and woke up three times to use the bathroom. Despite this, my Amazfit said I only woke up once. I literally walked steps to the bathroom, but apparently that wasn’t enough to trigger an “awake” reading. I still think it’s pretty dang accurate, though, and I choose this watch 100 times over. I can’t say enough good about it! I loved the default watch face that it comes with, but I prefer digital clocks so I chose a different one (as you can see in the photo). I do wish there were more choices, or that you could customize what is displayed on a specific watch face, but there are still quite a lot to choose from and it’s a huge visual upgrade compared to my previous Fitbits. I also like the “stress” tracker, though I’m not exactly sure how accurate this feature is. Still, it’s nice to be mindful of that and try to do some self care to bring those numbers down. Don’t be swayed by negative reviews. My husband has a different model (more “rugged” and “manly” looking lol) and he loves his just as much as I do. This is a really good brand with a really good price point.",5.0
Amazfit Active 2,"The device itself was wonderful and seemed to track fairly. I didn’t have any issues with the battery, and it was easy to charge and use. The pricing value was also very good in my experience. I appreciated the endless list of features. The watch was also lightweight, which was appreciated. I also loved the look of it, which was very stylish and didn’t scream “hi, I’m a nerd wearing a techy watch!”The downside for me was the connectivity issues that prevented me from using these wonderful features beyond the watch screen. Having bought it exclusively for fitness tracking, being unable to reliably store the data without manually disconnecting the watch and reconnecting each time was very frustrating. Your mileage may vary (and hopefully, they fix it in a future update), but I can’t recommend this watch to anyone looking to reliably sync. However, if you just want to track data in the moment and not keep it, this watch will be a perfect companion!",4.0
Amazfit Active 2,"I have an apple watch series 9, Fitbit Versa 4and now I have this watch.Firstly - it works flawlessly with my iphone 15 promax.It records everything into health and it works great with my insurance app ( Health transfers everything over).I wore my apple watch and this to see if there were any differences and besides the battery lasting on the Amazfit there is none.I like to train.

Can receive texts and calls coming through (just can’t talk or text through the watch, but that’s ok for me).The Zepp app works well too. I think the only improvement I’d like to see for that is the food log. I’m used to the Calorie Count app where you scan the barcode. The food log has an AI powered assistant.The Zepp app logs food through photo, text or voice. It occasionally gets it wrong, but there’s the ability to edit an incorrect item.Overall, I really like it! And now I don’t think I need or want an Apple Watch.",5.0

I have been a long time FitBit user but decided to change as their durability is not as it was. I ran a mile and this watch only calculated 0.64 miles. I though maybe it was a fluke, so the next day I ran another mile and it calculated 0.75 miles. While the treadmill and watch do not usually match up, my fitbit was never this far off from the treadmill. The steps are not accurate as well.Overall, if you are not really needing the fitness tracking features, then the watch is perfect. It's durable, fit nice, and is a great value.",4.0

Amazfit Bip 5,"After 4 months of using the Amazfit Bip 5 Unity fitness watch I found it to be very disappointing.  On the plus side it has a nice display, relatively good battery life, but when it comes to 'smart' and health and fitness monitoring, this watch falls short.  I don't like the user interface which requires swiping up or down or right and left to select various functions. Where to find settings is not intuitive and the software just doesn't work well at all.  Here are some reasons I dislike this product:- By default, it issues too many notifications and doesn't make it easy to change settings- Settings are in too many different places- One feature I really wanted to work is ""To Do"" list which allows the user to set reminders, but if you try to edit an item, it fails to find it, while it continues to send you notifications !??  I set reminders to do a certain activity during the day and this triggers an alert to remind me, but when the clock switched to Daily Savings Time, the reminders were delayed by one hour !?!- Some features worked for a while, but then stopped working, ie ability to receive txt messages, control your phone music player, receive app notifications - just stopped working - Did they update the software and broke it?- Support respond quickly to inquiries about problems, but the answers they provide tell me they are NOT familiar with this product.-  The step counter won't register activity until you've been stepping for quite a while which makes me wonder if it is accurate.-  Heartbeat measurements are NOT accurate-  Blood Oxygen measurements are NOT accurate-  Sleep monitoring is terrible - I wouldn't trust it.-  I tried to use Outdoor cycling tracking, but it fails to detect your mobile phone's GPSThis product tries to do a lot of things, but does most of them poorly.  Sure, it is relatively cheap at $50,  but it just doesn't cut it as a fitness  tracker, health monitor or smart device.",1.0

The heart rate is taking some getting used to, because I'm trying to save battery power. The step-count seems accurate. I tested by counting my steps for 50 to 100 steps at a time then checking the step numbers on the display. (The BIG display).The main reason I wanted this large display, is because I'm very old with poor eyesight. I can see this display easy! Without glasses, I can still see the Time and my heart rate, steps & O2.  Still getting used it, but so far, it's a Keeper!",5.0
Amazfit Gtr 3,This watch is extremely capable and has lots of features for its price range. It has a sleek design and is built very well.

It's also relatively slim and it feels good on the wrist.It's basically waterproof... But don't wear it in the shower. It has a tendency to respond to texts for you when the screen is wet. It uses scripted responses that can be quite rude in American vernacular. I've had to make many apologies to friends and family.I've bought a few Amazfit watches over the years (might be called Zepp now). I can attest to their quality.Battery life is not exaggerated. It feels unusual to actually have to charge this thing.One day, the screen just fell out of the bezel... That was odd, but I still think it's a great alternative to the high priced watches.I wonder if others have experienced the glue separating like that.",4.0
Amazfit Gtr 3,"Coming from the GTR 4, I really miss the voice alerts when my heart rate is higher than my safe limits and when I need to drink water. This GTR 3 Pro shines the brightest when measuring my SpO2 all the time and displays its on my watch face so I don't have to reach for my phone when I'm not feeling well. As a suffer of CTEPH, I need to know when I'm running low in SpO2, and this watch is within 1%+/- of my pulse oximeter. It doesn't yell at me like the GTR 4 did when I was walking and my heart rate surpassed 150 bpm, but this watch does vibrate to let me know I'm past my safe limit. It's a great watch, very comfortable to wear, and the only one I saw that measures SpO2 constantly (awake and asleep).",5.0
Amazfit Gtr 3,"April 6, 2024: Update, I reached out to customer service because, well, the battery problem is simply unacceptable for only having it for just over a year. Let me preface how it is used: I wear it 24/7, but use it to 1) look at texts/calls as they come in 2) check the time, 3) use the stop watch for about 20 minutes a day total and 4) find my phone. Most of these features I only use about 5 times a week. I don't use it to play games or really much of anything that would suck the battery up too badly. So when I reached out to customer service their response was very obviously automated asking me to troubleshoot the problem. No issue. When I did and said more or less, ""it is pretty obviously the battery"", they essentially reiterated ways I could try to ""save"" the battery life, with another automated response. Suggestions included:Please refer to the following instructions to troubleshoot the issue:1) The watch charging takes about 2.5 hours, please confirm whether your watch is fully charged;2) The battery life may vary according to settings, usage, climatic temperature, and other factors. So the actual result may differ from the laboratory data.3) The more power-consuming applications in the watch will also shorten the battery life.  Please also check whether the watch is with the latest firmware.  If not, please upgrade the watch and observe the battery performance;Note: The following apps would cause fast power consumption: screen display, sleep breathing quality, frequent use of Bluetooth phones or listening to music (if supported), the Screen-on Duration for too long, too many notification reminders, Always On Display enabled, GPS for a long time Exercise, turn on Auto Blood Oxygen Monitor, etc.4) Then please do the following settings to see if the watch battery life will improve.* Set the Response speed of Lift wrist to view info function to Normal mode* Turn off the Always On Display* Disable Sleep breathing quality monitoring* Disable Auto Stress Monitoring* Disable Auto Blood Oxygen Monitor* Change the Screen-on Duration time to 5 seconds* Do not choose any Wake-up Mode for Offline Voice ControlIt has now been 4 days since that reply, at which point I reiterated that it is very obviously an issue with the battery and disabling any and all of the above ""suggestions"" would defeat the purpose of having a smartwatch. I'm still waiting on a response. Changing my review to a one star because of the customer service.March 31, 2024: I've had this watch for over a year, 16 months to be exact. All of a sudden the battery life just tanked, despite using it exactly the same as I always have in the past. It's battery life is okay but only lasts about half as long as it used to.Additionally, it has issues with notifications where it will continue to display text notifications that I've already read and acknowledged.  Again, not a big deal but annoying.Overall, it is an okay watch. I'm not sure if I intend to continue using it moving forward or if I will get something different.",1.0
Amazfit Gtr 3,"I've had this watch for about a year. The battery lasts for weeks.  It's amazing how many metrics it captures. For example it knows how many serves, backhands, and forehands I make when playing tennis. I take it in a hot sauna, pool, hottub, and shower with no issues... I just need to lock the screen since water drops active the touch screen.",5.0
Amazfit Balance 2,"Smart watches have either come a really long way in the past two years since my last Google watch, or this is just a superior product. My guess is the latter. Beautiful big screen, add an animated face if you like, and still get four or five days usage between charges. Then, the charge is quick and easy. Accurate sleep, blood oxygen, and heart rate readings, plus bunches of personalized prompts if you buy the subscription service. I didn't know about that one upfront, but it was $30 for the first year and the prompts seem useful, not fluffy, so didn't feel too bad about that surprise. Again, the face is so beautiful and the apps so useful that this watch is a pleasure to use. Don't much need it, but I even enjoy the compass because its so well done. On top of everything else, the voice memo app is super easy to work with. This watch gets a Wow and two thumbs up!",5.0
Amazfit Balance 2,"Garmin Fenix features and quality for a third of the price. In some areas it's actually got features Garmin doesn't currently match.  The AI assistant is actually shockingly useful for something they aren't charging for. Amazing batter life, fantastic tracking. I've been wearing mine for cross training (weights, plus, running) and  it hasn't missed a beat. Easily connects to external sensors if you want to wear a strap but so far the wrist monitor has been great. Id probably still strap for dedicated HIIT workouts but the watch has surprised me even when doing wrist intensive activity.The only thing that it absolutely sucks at is food tracking and that has nothing to do with the watch itself.  They want it or be exclusively AI based and yes when it works it's quick and super convenient but when it misses you have zero. ZERO ability to edit or enter manual foods.  It's a new feature for zepp so hopefully they build this out to Include more traditional food database entry. For now it's just not useable for anyone serious about nutrition. Thankfully it's easy enough to just ignore it and use another option like Samsung health or my fitness.Id say it's 90 of a Fenix for 30% of the price.",5.0
Amazfit Balance 2,"Fantastic watch! Was waiting for this one because the T-rex was just too bulky to wear business wise. The Balance 2 looks amazing. Has so many great options. Watch faces are very informative. After wearing an Apple Watch for 8+ years I was so surprised to find out that there are other watches out there that supersede the Apple Watch by miles on battery life, screen size, options and design. No negatives so far. Received it last week, used it frequently, battery percentage now around 59%.I used the watch for strength exercises and running. It was spot on!",5.0
Amazfit Balance 2,"Bright blue bezel?  One of the reviews mentioned this, it doesn't have a bright blue bezel??  I have been an amazfit customer for year and love them.  I had a balance and a garmin approach s70 and when they introduced the balance 2 with golf I had to try it.  I compared the 2 for two rounds and the amazfit was just as good.  Not as many golf features but just the ones I need.  I sold the garmin and put money in my pocket and only use 1 watch now for everything.  Love the sleep tracking.  No complaints.  You do have to download the courses you are going to play where the garmin has them all pre loaded.  Only takes seconds per download.",5.0
Amazfit Balance 2,"I have owned two previous Amazfit watches and they have good quality and features. One feature I found useful is the Alexa support, unfortunately Amazfit has removed Alexa support on the Balance 2 in favor of their own Zepp Flow AI which doesn’t allow me to control the various devices in my home. The Balance 2 is a beautiful well made watch but removing Alexa support is a dealbreaker for me. I have returned the watch to Amazon.",4.0
Amazfit Balance 2,"I’ve never looked forward to a watch more—and been so disappointed—than with the Balance 2. I had high hopes and eagerly awaited its arrival, but the reality didn’t live up to the anticipation.First, while it may seem minor to some, the bright blue bezel was a dealbreaker for me. I was genuinely surprised that Amazfit launched this device with only a bold blue option. It’s a puzzling choice, especially when most people would likely prefer a more neutral color scheme. In person, the blue is brighter than it appears in photos and clashed heavily with the included red band. The combination just felt off, and I couldn't understand why multiple color options weren't offered from the start.Second—and more frustrating—is the display's inability to repel fingerprints. It’s one of the worst I’ve experienced. Despite the Sapphire glass, fingerprints stick easily and require constant wiping. I’ve used many watches, including the Apple Watch Ultra, and never had an issue this bad. It became a daily annoyance.Third, the performance was underwhelming. On certain watch faces, the second hand would freeze, and navigating the app list would lag or become unresponsive. Oddly, the Balance 2 felt slower and less stable than the original Balance 1.While I appreciate the effort Amazfit made with the Balance 2, the execution fell short. Perhaps the $299 price point doesn’t allow for higher-end materials or better performance, but ironically, the Gorilla Glass on my T-Rex 3 handled fingerprints far better. So did the Balance 1.In the end, I returned the Balance 2 and will likely return to Garmin. A lot of potential here, but too many compromises.",2.0
Amazfit Balance 2,"Received a Garmin watch instead of this from Amazon, but has since been corrected. I got a refund and purchased this elsewhere. Watch is amazing. Huge performance boost for the price! The colors are perfect and sapphire glass is top notch. Get a screen protector and accessories if you don't like some minor personal preference.",5.0
Amazfit Refurbished T-Rex 3,"Why did you pick this product vs others?:I was mostly looking for a watch that would give me at least 2 weeks of battery life.  This does that and looks great too.Battery life:The battery life gives me about 2 weeks of power before a charge.  I cannot stand to charge a watch every day.  You can adjust the settings a lot to get even better, but with most things active and a timed always on, I get about 2 weeks.Display quality:The display is high resolution and the included watch faces are great for what I use this for.Watch quality:This is a high quality watch with a decent water rating and comfortable feel.  The strap that came with it is nice, and they also give you the connectors to use almost any 22 mm watch band.Screen size:The screen size is perfect even for my old eyes. It's clear and even with the smallest font I can still read it clearly.  Looks really nice.Overall I'm very happy with this watch.  The quality is good, the function is great and the battery life is decent.  I miss having a watch with a e-ink / Trans-reflective screen, but this one fills the gap.  One of the best things is the ability to finally send a text message from the watch.  You can either Quick respond with a canned message, or do a custom message, but this make life much easier than my past Amazfit watches.  I now am the happy owner of 3 Amazfit watches and I think They will always just be my go to for price performance.",5.0
Amazfit Refurbished T-Rex 3,"This is my second T-Rex, first was T-Rex Pro (still going strong, but now is my work watch) and the T-Rex 3 is my everyday/workout watch. Went for my second bicycle ride using with the watch, cross checked the information with my phone, both readings were the same. I really like that I have been wearing the watch for 3 days and still have 90% battery. This is becoming one of my favorite watches. I have owned three Samsung watches (don't like the battery life) and two Citizen watches (one smart and one hybrid) and really like them. I like the large display, makes it easy to see information while riding my bike. Have not explored all that the watch can do, but am looking forward to seeing.",5.0
Amazfit Refurbished T-Rex 3,"It's been great so far. I get about 2 weeks out of a charge. It is a little bit better than the older t-rex I had. More functions than the old one and better sensitivity.

Amazfit Refurbished T-Rex 3,"Great watch so far compared to my previous Suunto Peak 9. What I like most about the T-Rex is the reminders it has that notice when you've been sitting for too long and reminds you to get up. It also have many features I'm sure more active people than me will find very useful. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because even when you're home on your own network it doesn't maintain nor automatically reconnect when you return home. You have to manually reconnect it to your home network and even then after a while it will disconnect itself. I've contacted Amazfit support in reference to the WiFi not maintaining a connection and they stated that maybe the software will be updated in the future to allow it to auto-reconnect to WiFi. Otherwise, I'm very happy with it. I got this watch April 6th, 2025.",4.0
Amazfit Refurbished T-Rex 3,"I wanted a Garmin but somehow, I stumbled on to a review that compared the TRex to a Garmin and they were a wash in quality and accuracy. But the price makes AMAZFIT a no brainer. I got the T-Rex 2 for Christmas and loved it, loved it, loved it. Wow! Hundreds of times better than my apple or Google watches that I had to charge everyday. No bueno for me. The T-Rex with everything running on had to be charged every two weeks. That's AMAZING. Only downside to some may be that it doesn't show images from messages and you can only text back with quick responses that it lets you dictate through the ZEPP app. And OMG, the ZEPP app is awesome too. All around great product. You are missing out if you don't try AMAZFIT.Had to get another because I almost got my arm caught in a machine that luckily only took my watch and not my arm. Praise God!

Amazfit Refurbished T-Rex 3,"I rarely write reviews on Amazon. However, I have been a long time Garmin user and decided to try Amazfit. I must say I love this watch. The features and accuracy are on par with my Epix pro Gen 2 with the exception of Maps and navigation which I rarely use and a built in flash light on the Epix. Not to mention my Epix was over $1000 dollars. For what I do, lifting and general cardio this watch is perfect. It feels better on my wrist and IMO has a better UI. It is way better at counting reps and identifying the exercise I am doing compared to my Epix. The battery is fantastic. I get an easy 3 weeks with training 6 days a week with it. That is without the AOD enabled. With it enabled I still get over 10 days. For the price of this watch it is the best value out if you are looking for a Sports watch. It works with Android and iOS. I cannot recommend this watch enough!",5.0

Amazfit Renewed Bip 5,"I've been using this for several months now.  I cannot say enough good things about it.Cautions - get the screen protectors, it scratches a LOT faster than my Apple watch did, but at this price I wasn't surprised.Comparing to the Apple watch, the system software is a little cumbersome.  Some things you have to do on the app, some things on the watch face.  Coming from the Apple - it's just not quite as intuitive.The size is great.  So much easier to see things than the Apple.  And it does pair just fine with my Iphone (I was worried about that).  For IOS users - you do need to leave the app open, but all the functions are there and it sucks up almost no battery.",5.0

Amazfit Renewed Bip 5,"I love the battery life this watch has. I bought this to replace my fitbit versa 2. I have always been able to reach my step and stair goal most days with the total 3 fitbit watches I've had over the years. I've had this watch for a few months and loved it but noticed right off the bat ,I was unable to reach my step goal and have not reached it one time since putting it on. I was chaulking it up to my old watch being worn out and I just wasn't moving as much. Even during the holidays where I am running most of the day, I couldn't reach 9k steps compared to almost 20k for previous watches. Today I have been doing house work since waking up ,while I am doing the dishes, I get a notification that I have been sitting for more than an hour and need to get up and move. This cemented my thoughts on the accuracy of tracking movement. It's a great watch overall but it's barely worth it for me if the step feature is not accurate as that is one of the main reasons I own a smart watch.",1.0

Amazfit Bip 3,"This is probably my 5th smart watch, but my first after leaving the Pebble ecosystem. I was very attached to the Pebble approach to smart watches, and it's been impossible to find an exact replacement. For the price, this is probably as good as it gets.I've had this for over a year, and if it broke tomorrow, I would replace it.Pros:- Excellent battery life, as good as advertised. I haven't keep precise tabs on how long, but easily a couple of weeks. I wear this day and night, and recharge it periodically ""when I remember"" while in the shower. Battery life is a top priority for me - I am absolutely not going to have a watch I have to charge daily.- Light weight and a good size - not too big or too small. Comfortable to wear all the time and forget about.- Has the features I care most about - sleep tracking, exercise tracking, message/email notifications, and alarm/stopwatch.- Design is inoffensive (most casual people think this is an Apple product for some reason)- WaterproofCons:- Really miss the always-on display from the Pebbles- The plastic display gets light scratches easily (but not so badly it interferes with operation)- Unlike other people, I find the Zepp app irritating. It buries what I want under too many menu layers, and is set up to constantly push you to purchase add-ons.- I'm not in love with the watch face selection- The included silicon watch strap didn't last long, maybe a few months at most.Neither a pro/con - the all-plastic design is not my preference, but for the price exactly what I expected.Overall, this is really decent product for the price. Honestly I was surprised at how reliable and sturdy it's been - every smart watch I've had has had some kind of hardware issue or problem by the 1 year mark. But this little device keeps trooping and has the minimum set of feature I require. Every compromise (materials, screen type) that's a demerit for me is an understandable function of price.I would absolutely recommend this if your criteria are the same as mine.",5.0
Amazfit Bip 3,"Pleased with it. It's pretty good for what I needed it for. The display is nice – big enough to see my stats without feeling like I'm squinting. Setup was a breeze; it played nice with my several years old iphone.Now, let's talk battery life – the one thing that left me feeling a bit meh. It's not terrible, but it's not great either. I have to charge it more often than I'd like. Every 3 days or so. An extra day would've been awesome, but for the price I paid it's ok... I guess you win some, you lose some.The health and fitness tracking is solid. Steps, heart rate, sleep – it's all there. The design is cool, not too flashy. Straps are comfy, and the size is good - it doesn't look like I stole the watch from some sci-fi movie. Notifications come through fine, too, so I'm not missing out on the important stuff.In a nutshell, it is an average choice in the smartwatch world if you don't want to invest too much. If you're cool with charging every few days and just need the basic stuff without breaking the bank, it'll do the job. But if you value long lasting battery life, you might wanna keep on scrolling.",5.0
Amazfit Bip 3,"Positives:- Long battery life, lasts about two weeks (although I tend to charge before it goes all the way down to zero, maybe on the 10th day or so)- Quick charging- Great functionality - lots of exercise options for instance (yoga, elliptical, walking, indoor fitness, dance are the exercises I do the most, and these are all available), sleep tracking, HR monitoring, alarms / stopwatch / timer etc- Different watch faces- Easy navigation in both the app and on the watch face. On the watch, a double-click gets you to the various functions and you can easily get to the workout option you need, or a down swipe gets you to the alarm setting. App is similarly intuitive and easy to use.Negatives:- Feel of the watch. It looks great and could even pass for an Apple Watch, but it’s much lighter, the straps and buckle don’t feel quite as solid, the watch itself is housed in an all-plastic casing. For the price, this is perhaps expected, and hopefully it will last longer than the more expensive Apple Watch and Fitbit it’s replacing- While the app is good, it has some grammatical issues (amazfit needs better proofers or translators!)- My biggest beef is actually with the PAI. Unlike Fitbit’s “active zone minutes” which has a clear calculation methodology (1 active zone minute for every minute HR is in fat burn zone, double that in the cardio/peak zone), PAI calcs are much less transparent. Also PAI is based on a rolling 7-day count of your full day’s activity, and doesn’t reset week to week like Active Zone minutes. All this to say that you have to be fairly consistent in achieving a higher level of activity every single day to maintain the target PAI of 100, unlike the Fitbit where you can feel good about earning your Active Zone Minutes for the calendar week in shorter periods of more intense activity. I suppose this should be a motivator, but it also feels like I’m getting dinged if I take one rest day in a week because it affects my present PAI. Also, you can earn PAI more easily from getting your heart rate up to the anaerobic zone, even if it’s a shorter workout and you burn fewer calories than in a longer, more sustained workout at a lower heart rate zone. Eg. Getting your heart rate up to 95% of your max for 20 mins and burning 170 calories is worth more in PAI, than a 1-hr workout at 70% of your max heart rate and burning 350 calories. If you don’t care about tracking the PAI metric, then this shouldn’t bother you.Overall a good product!-------Update: Comparison with FITBIT Versa 2- HR monitor. The Amazfit overestimates heart rate during exercise. Eg. during Zumba workouts my peak HR gets up to 190 bpm on the Amazfit vs 157 on Fitbit (which seems more feasible - not out of breath!)- Calories burned. Similarly, the Amazfit overestimates calories burned during exercise - for a 50 min dance workout, the Amazfit registers 340 calories burned, vs Fitbit's 228.- Activity auto-tracking. The Fitbit can sense activity even without turning the ""exercise"" function on but the Amazfit is not sensitive to this.- Steps. Fitbit's more generous in counting steps than Amazfit; my 50-min dance workout gave me almost 4000 steps on the Fitbit, vs 3,450 on the Amazfit.-  PAI vs Active Minutes. Amazfit's PAI metric mostly rewards cardio workouts, whereas Fitbit rewards you for time spent on exercising even if it's lower intensity.",4.0
Amazfit Gts 2,"I’ve had this watch for 2.5yrs now and it’s still going strong!! Best I’ve used and better than other fancy watches that are 10X+ more expensive! Battery lasts days and recharges fast! You can get alerts for calls and messages (I have it linked to direct calls and texts and WhatsApp), answer or reject calls using the phone, gives current weather when linked to your phone, tracks your cycles etc. Great and accurate at tracking heart rate, blood pressure, sleeping patterns and have good workout tracking options. And my favorite feature that really makes this watch shine is that it’s waterproof! I wear it 24/7, in the shower/bath etc and wait for it for swimming on a regular basis. It tracks laps I swim and after 2.5 years it’s not showing any issues with water getting in! How amazing is that! Not even Apple Watches do that, in fact my iPhone 12 died after a few months of purchase after wearing it around a water park with less than 5 mins of min shallow water submersion! Handles rough wear and tear well too! Looks great, fit and feel is great, works amazing, most durable tech gadget I’ve ever owned, highly highly recommend!!! It really is the full package! Oh and affordable too!!!",5.0
Amazfit Gts 2,"I use the Notify for Amazfit app to add way better sleep tracking which includes heart rate measurements too.This is used with Sleep As Android app.In addition to excellent battery life, I also get my text and email notifications so I can stay on top of things. It takes a while to get everything set up but once done it was well worth the investment.Costs an extra $2.99 for the Notify for Amazfit app's pro version (that's all that's needed) for text/call messages displayed on a high resolution screen.No more pulling out my phone to find out it's one of those robo calls... A simple twist of my wrist is all it takes.Did I say battery life? I now get about 1 and 1/2 to 2 weeks which is way more than I would have ever expected considering I use this all the time and the display is always on and the heart rate is being taken every 5 minutes.I initially got this according to the sleep reviews I was reading but now find it to be an indispensable tool without always having to reach for my phone.Which now stays in my pocket mostly.The addition of a pretty accurate weather forecast keeps me from going out without a coat if needed here in Las Vegas which can be unpredictable at times during the winter season.The inclusion of a Pomodoro Timer was very unexpected and being put to use.I use other apps and devices to get my workout data and have not tried to see how it performs against this device but they all integrate well with Google Fit.I can't comment much about the steps feature as I only care about how much time I'm doing an activity and the heart rate monitor seems to be good enough to show that I'm working at it thoughout the day automatically and the built in PAI display tells me as well.No inexpensive wrist-based watch can give any pulse accuracy you can Bank on. The ones that do are all giant size and this one fits very nice on my wrist.And be multi-functional like this one.All in all a very good smartwatch at a low cost compared to the competition.Amazfit Mini -- You're the best for me!!!",5.0
Amazfit Gts 2,"05/22/22 - I have had this watch for a little over a week (using with a Pixel 6 Pro). My summary take is: lots of good with a few rough spots.Pros:* Price: For the cost and what it does, this thing is a great value.* Battery life: As I am writing this, it has been seven days since I took it off the charger and I am sitting at 37% batter. Pretty outstanding.* Comfort: This thing is comfortable. Numerous times I have caught myself looking down at my wrist the make sure I am still wearing it. I literally can't tell that I am still wearing it at times. It is so lightweight. Also, I don't feel compelled to remove it when I get sweaty, as I have for other smart watches I own. Even when it gets sweaty, it is easy to wipe clean.* Sleep tracking: I am certainly not a sleep tracking nut, so I can not speak to the nitty gritty of things like REM tracking and such. But I will say that this has accurately tracked my general sleep duration every night this past week. And it is automatic! I previously used an app on my phone to track my sleep duration, but I would have to manually start it and stop it each night/morning. But with this watch, I just go to sleep and it automatically tracks it.* Music control: This is an important feature to me because I like to be able to play/pause my phone's music without needing to pull my phone out of my pocket. The music controls are not quite as convenient as what you'll find on Wear OS, but it certainly gets the job done.Cons:* Google Fit integration: This is hit and miss. It does seem to accurately track my daily steps to Google Fit. Exercise activity is a different story. The only two exercise types I have explicitly done on the Amazfit are indoor biking and outdoor biking. In both cases, the Zepp app syncs those to Google Fit as ""Others"", not as their actual exercise types. Not a huge deal, but I wish those were synced to Google Fit as what they actually are.* Voice assistants: The watch comes with Alexa support built in. I have not tested this yet because I am not an Alexa user at all. My house and other devices are 100% Google Assistant driven. Coming from a primarily Wear OS smartwatch life, it would be nice if I could set Google Assistant up on the Amazfit as opposed to Alexa, but I am pretty sure that Alexa is the only option here.",4.0
Amazfit Bip 3,"Received lilac colored watch 100% charged on December 3, 2024:*Purchased a snowman clock face for winter and added no other apps or faces.*The screen area is large and clear enough that I can read it easily, from a reasonable distance without my glasses-at the same distance, I can not read my PC monitor, without glasses.*You will need your personal cell phone to activate your watch. You will use the app on your phone to interact with your watch more extensively--like to add apps, or to purchase watch faces.  Speaking of watch faces, there is a decent collection, and they are very reasonably priced!  I plan to get more pretty soon, but not before I finish this review. Overall, it is fairly simple and straight forward to activate the watch and to get apps and watch faces for it.*You need to activate some features before they will work.  I did NOT activate any features.  I am using ONLY the out-of-the-box features. EXCEPT that I did purchase and install a snowman watch face.*The way it should operate is that when you lift your arm to look at it, it lights up; otherwise, it remains dark(off).  But this is not actually what happens.  The watch needs to determine when you are moving to look at the face, so that it knows when to turn the screen on.  Well, the sensor in my watch is very, very sensitive.  Sometimes I can just move my arm a little bit and the screen will come on.  Although, most times the screen does react properly.  Also, sometimes I get annoyed because it will go off to quickly. I try to listen to my 8 yo grandkid talk to me, and when I look back at my watch two sentences later, the screen is off.  I am sure there is a setting for that, but right now, I am not changing anything from factory settings outside of what I had to do to activate the watch.*I have some issue with the button on the side of the watch, but I am just not actually sure what it is.  I THINK that when I lift my arm up while I am pushing the button to view the time, that it causes the watch to scroll to give more information about the statistics posted on the face.  Not positive that is what happens though, because it does not happen that often.  Also, the button digs into the back of my hand when I am active and it bends backwards.  Sometimes that activates it and causes the problem above, but I do not catch it until it's too late to KNOW what happened.12/19/2024 Update:*It has been 15 days since I activated and started using my watch.  I still have about one-third of the battery life left!  That just blows my mind.  Everything is the same as it was above, I am pretty positive that I was correct about the issue with the button.December 28, 2024  battery is finally ready to be recharged.  I am fairly positive I would have had another day or two, but I do not want to push it.  So, the initial charged battery (out of the box) lasted 25 days.I will come back and update if something comes up with the watch, or if I experiment some more.  I am not worried, even if it does go nuts or something, I bought the protection plan.",5.0
Amazfit Bip 3,"Here's my thing about smart watches: I don't need it to have all the bells and whistles. I need it to tell the time, give me notifications, and last a long time. This does all of that plus more. The screen is vibrant and easy to read and the battery lasts a week or two. Great for my needs!",5.0
Amazfit Bip 3,"UPDATE (ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW)I've gotten notifications to work consistently now, but I wish the user experience in setting up the watch and getting them working had been clearer. I had to go into the notifications settings where you turn on notifications from different apps, and I had to go to the bottom and activate the one that just said ""APP,"" which to me seems kind of weird and not very intuitive--but at least it's working now.Other than that, I really like it a lot.____________________________________________________________________I've followed the troubleshooting steps in the Zepp app and on the Amazfit website.- background refresh is enabled for Zepp- I'm not in any Focus/Do not disturb mode of any kind- Zepp is updated to the latest version...- ... and I've verified a bunch of other stuff that they suggestedCan't figure out what's going on.It seems like it only sporadically captures the notifications from my phone, even when the phone is consistently in range. Today it didn't capture any notifications at all between 2:15 and 10:03 pm...  so, what's the deal?? I was getting them at first, and now it seems I'm not getting them at all.Also, the heart rate monitor seems to be wildly inaccurate at times (it measured 72 bpm once when I was whacking weeds with a hoe...). Most of the time it seems to be basically accurate.",4.0
Amazfit Bip 3,"This watch is great for every day wear, and has long battery life. I've had mine for nearly a year and it still looks new. The only thing I dislike is that you can't have more than two watch faces on it at once. Still worth it, though.",5.0
Amazfit Bip 3,"Honestly this watch is perfect!! I have gone through 3 watches and this is one is the best!! The biggest feature that I like to have on any watch is the ability to see text messages without having my phone constantly on me and having to look at it so often. This watch can receive any text apps and any app you want to receive notifications from. I have the sky blue color. Not only did I get this watch because of the receiving texts ability the font is bigger too and I also love the 5 ATM water feature it can get wet like while swimming, showering etc. I also needed this feature for work so I don't have to constantly take off my watch to wash dishes. Overall AMAZING watch !!!",5.0

Amazfit T-Rex Ultra Tactical Smart,"Ok, everybody has terrible bands these days, so I am deducting no points. The band in the picture is the Hēmsut leather band you can get separately.I am converting from a Fitbit Versa 4 that has served me well, but I did it a battery injury while in a hospital bed FOR 2 MONTHS and it now needs to be charged daily to log my heart rhythm and SpO2 levels, which is too easy to forget. I need the hourly logs to have with me for cardiologist visits as we monitor my artificial heart valve, 20 years old and still running!The T-Rex Ultra is OVERKILL for what I want, but I was after the battery life and water resistance (I’ve murdered a couple watches in a swimming pool, finding that “10m water resistance” doesn’t compete with dive ratings) which it covers across the board. I charged it when it arrived, then had to run through 3 firmware upgrades to get to the current OS, Zepp OS 4. That was 3 days ago. The watch, despite having hourly testing on, WiFi active, and live Accuweather running, still has 76% left on the battery. That’s awesome!A lot of the workout tools I have only poked at, not put to use fully, but I am recovering from muscle atrophy following my hospitalization. When the weather warms up, the pup and I will be putting it to use and if there are issues, I’ll come back and add it.Overall, considering I was looking at a Garmin watch for 3 times the cost, I’ve compared capabilities between it (my close friend owns it) and the Amazfit holds a dead even rating. That says a lot!Thus far, I’ve banged the glass into my guitar and the inside of my server with absolutely no scratching. The steel frame helps.Overall, for health needs, I can log everything in Apple Health on my iPhone, export to a spreadsheet in Google Docs, and have detailed info for my docs when I have appointments. I couldn’t ask for better usability.100% cat compatible!",5.0
Amazfit T-Rex Ultra Tactical Smart,"First of all, I am a previous iWatch person. I have had three, my last being the iWatch ultra. I purchased iWatches for the features, heart rate, exercise, etc. I was never happy with the square shape, but I used it to monitor my activities, sleep, heart, oxygen. I was never happy with the battery life, I was having to charge every day. Then I purchased this watch after doing some research. It does everything the iWatch does, but in my opinion better. It looks great and it is very dependable and rugged. The battery life is great. For example, I charged my watch four days ago and I am at 75% now. I would highly recommend this watch.",5.0

Amazfit T-Rex Ultra Tactical Smart,"I had every single T-Rex version but this one is definitely top notch. New software, improved interface, 20-day battery life on a regular use, steel case are definitely worth the money. I like that you can change the bands on this ultra model so I fitted mine with carbon fiber Luminox band. Totally changes appearance of the watch without adding any weight. I took it on 10 day vacation to Mexico and swimming in the ocean was no problem with this watch.Quite accurate heart rate and step counter as well as O2 levels. Didn't try blood sugar or blood pressure monitor but that's not what I bought it for in the first place.Two small nuisances... On the 1st time getting GPS lock can take some time but it works fine afterwards, second...I still do not understand why the Amazfit didn't implement option to increase font size on the watch on the 4th iteration of Trex.Screen resolution and AMOLED display are certainly excellent and I don't see why they can't or won't do itBottom line I would recommend this watch to anyone looking for rugged SmartWatch with long battery life, extensive amount of watch faces and customization, external applications and so on.It is not on pair with Garmin watches for professional athletes but for every day use for fraction of the cost definitely highly recommended.",5.0

Apple Watch Series 10,Purchased this watch for my husband's birthday!  He LOVE IT!  He wears it all the time for work and especially when working out. This watch allows him to stay on top of all communication for work and not miss a beat.  Excellent quality that can be dressed up for business or down for work outs.  Love that it is water proof!  Easy to set up and has a long battery life.  I purchased the larger size for my husband and it fits perfectly!,5.0
Apple Watch Series 10,"Upgraded from a series 6 to this series 10. Very glad that I did! The watch itself is much lighter than my previous one, screen is much larger and brighter. I did sacrifice losing out on the blood oxygen level monitor that was included in the series 6 version but that’s not a huge deal for me. The sport watch band with this version is quite thinner than the 6. I was disappointed in that quality but I rarely wear the included rubber sport band. The 10’s battery life lasts longer than the battery life I was getting with the 6 lately. And the 10 charges super quick. So even if I do run the battery down I can quickly recharge it. The auto detection of fitness activity is one of my favs. The series 6 I was using failed to perform that function like it used to. I’ve been careful not to bump the screen of the watch but have once bumped it and didn’t see any scratch or tick in the screen. Seems durable so far. And the best thing of it all if that the expensive, nice watch bands I invested in with my previous watch all fit this version with now issues. That was a concern of mine and would’ve dictated if I returned this version.Like other reviewers, I opened the Amazon delivery box (which was packaged fairly well) and noticed that one loop on the outside of the Apple Watch packaging almost appeared as if it had been previously opened - despite me purchasing a new item. I proceeded forward and noticed that the white thin pull tab stickers on both the watch package and the band package hadn’t been opened. So that was relief. Guess the outside just got shuffled. If you see the pulled tabs on the two inner boxes are still attached, then you know what’s inside will be new.Overall the purchase has been good and I highly recommend the 10.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 10,"Awesome upgrade from the SE (2nd Gen) I want to start off with the size. It feels like the body (42mm) is almost the same size as the 40mm AW SE but the screen is bigger due to smaller bezels. The glossy black looks really nice. I haven’t scratched it yet but I’m guessing it will scratch easily. But let’s talk about two upgrades that make it worth it to me.1) Always On Display. The SE (2nd generation) didn’t have it and it’s a huge difference for me. I can see the time and complication data all the time without lifting my wrist. I would also recommend turning off “Raise To Wake” as it’s unnecessary with this feature on. Surprisingly even having the AOD, the battery is pretty good leading into my second favorite part of this watch.2)  Battery. Somehow I’m getting more time out of the battery with the Always On Display than my SE with Raise To Wake. With my old AW, I had to top it off in the morning and at night as it would be at around 20% at the end of the day. So far I’ve been charging this watch to around 90% before I got to bed and still easily getting 24hrs between charges. On top of that it fast charges quickly so basically I stick it on the charger while taking a shower and it’s usually almost fully charged when I get out. I still consider it a 1 day battery so it’s not crazy long if you’re someone who likes to spend days outdoors or whatever. But I just like the fact I don’t have to think too much about the charging. Just throw it on the charger for like 30 minutes and it’s good for a day or so.In short decent screen size, fast charging, battery that lasts at least 24 hrs, and Always On Display.Cons: The battery could still be better. I feel that Apple could focus more on battery and less on making it slimmer than previous watches. I don’t want a bulky watch either but it would be nice to get at least 2-3 days of heavy use between charges. Disappointed that the Blood Oxygen app doesn’t work. I know there’s a lawsuit but it still sucks that the app is downloaded but non functional. If you own a more recent AW this probably isn’t worth it specifically if you already have a modern looking watch with AOD.",4.0
Apple Watch Ultra 2,"Great watch, does everything I want it to except for two things:- The O2 sensor isn't allowed to be used (U.S.)- It needs to be charged constantly. If you let it go, you can probably get 2, maybe 3 days out of it. But I ended up buying chargers and put them around the house, so if I'm sitting somewhere, I just charge it shorter.It feels nice, looks great. The cost to value ratio seems to be great.I did get a cover for the watch (tempered glass) and that seems to break a lot. I've gone through 3 or 4 of them already. But theyve done their job and I can't complain. The watch is stil immaculate.",5.0

Even though calory count is not accurate, but there are no accurate calory counters. The most amazing feature for me is the batter life! AMAZING!",5.0

Whether I’m hiking, diving, working out, or just heading into meetings, the Ultra 2 fits seamlessly into my lifestyle. The redesigned Action Button is customizable and perfect for quick access to workouts, waypoints, or a flashlight.With new features like precision dual-frequency GPS, on-device Siri, and the customizable modular Ultra watch face, this is more than a smartwatch—it’s a full-on wrist-based tool for those who push boundaries.If you’re looking for the ultimate Apple Watch with unmatched versatility and performance, the Ultra 2 is it.",5.0

This arrived and I paired it with my phone only to find that it had fewer functions than my 7 year old watch. I have been a major fan and user of Apple products until now.

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"Now I hate being the type of person to leave a one star review on an item bringing down the overall stars with nothing to do with the item, but the experience I went through. But I don't know where else to leave it so I'm sorry. I don't know if it has happened to anyone else but they swapped my watch somewhere in the process, but my package was not tampered with, just the watch box itself and not the shipping brown box. It had some thicker peel to open tape, the white strip one and even the Milanese loop was exchanged with a refurbished one. Amazon has now refunded my money after almost 3 hours of back and forth calling. The first time I called the customer service rep immediately said I will issue a refund and keep the item but all that was refunded was the shipping, 9 days later still no refund. Called again and then denied the whole refund, said the rep did not get authorized to do so; we're sorry but there's nothing to do anymore. This rep had a hard time understanding that they swapped the item and not that I didn't like the item received and when she did, and insisted it was Apple so I needed to contact them. So I escalated to their manager and he said we will honor it and do this ONE TIME courtesy refund, and I said well this does not give me confidence to keep buying large valued amount items from you then. One time, wow. I said I am an honest person and am not trying to scam anyone here but someone somewhere inside is switching items with refurbished or possibly even their own. Could be from Apple,  Well like I said they made it right, but beware. Overall coming from the Watch 3 series it's a yuuuuge upgrade, I love all the new features, way faster and smoother screen animations , I wish I would have received the black at least to review that one but I am growing fond of this color. Let's see how long this one lasts since it's probably refurbished but overall looks clean and new.",2.0

Although it is a little more difficult to put on and take off than the alpine, to me it feels more ""secure"" for when I wear it to public places like malls or amusement parks.The only things I wish were different about the Iwatch Ultra:1. I wish it was a little lighter and just a tad slimmer.2. I wish it had a slightly higher speaker volume option for calls and music.3.

I could get all these things in a less expensive Apple watch, but I dropped my other Apple watch on a concrete floor and the glass shattered. So, I upgraded. The thing that makes this watch stand out from other less expensive ones is that it is clunky and heavy duty looking. It has the appearance of a heavy duty military watch.",5.0

Took a chance at joining the millions of users of these devices and so far have enjoyed the sleep tracking feature the most. Unfortunately, its very buggy, and not well documented with respect to using it, but I am finding that true of nearly all the Apple watch software applications. You really have to jump through hoops to figure them out. I'm a little disappointed in the choices of watch faces, but I'll live. It's a learning process, I'm only on the road and know I have a lot longer to go. Maybe I'll find something wonderful in the future, so far it's underwhelming. A lot of the apps just hold no interest to me. The health app pesters me to stand up, was so annoying I ended up just disabling it. I appreciate the connection to my iPhone the most. Getting silent alerts has been useful, doesn't interrupt my interviews (I'm a physician) in an annoying way. I like that. Not sure it was worth the hundreds of dollars the watch cost.

Came in pristine condition, no scratches, everything worked beautifully, setup was a breeze, connected right away to my iPhone 12. Just one issue tho, battery health was teetering just below the guaranteed 80%, that was the only thing, I reached out to the company and their customer service and support was top tier, they offered to replace the watch but everything else was so perfect with it I just didn’t wanna part from it. So me and the company worked it out and came to an agreement that worked best for me and I ended up keeping the watch and receiving a partial refund. With that being said, surprisingly no issues with the battery life so far, keeps a full charge all day and half the night. I work overnights, so sometimes I have my watch on from 9am - 4am that night. Battery makes it thru the day with juice to spare, usually only hits about 35 - 23% by the time I finally get to sit it on the dock. And I do everything with this thing, I run about 2-3 miles per day, have to keep up with a toddler, plus his swim classes, boxing classes and much more. So far, this watch has stood up to the test! The specific seller I purchased from was WOOT, they have great ratings, and really good customer service, I would highly recommend them. Sold by woot, but shipped by Amazon.

Apple Watch Series 5,"Do not purchase these watches, read the reviews. 3 watches, all duds.TLDR: I bought 3 of these watches that all had issues and now have to wait up to 30 days for a refund I may not receive. I am confident they are replacing the glass on these watches sub par and then making them no longer waterproof.  Once they have water damage, they say they will not refund your money, despite Apple watches being “swim proof” according to the site.  The watches said they were sold by “woot” but then the box instructions had a different seller.I bought 3 of these watches for my kids about 10 days ago.  From the start I had concerns because it seemed like they would not charge to 100% and set up was a little clunky.  I also read previous reviews about the glass breaking easy, so I put screen protectors on them immediately.  I have had an apple watch since they first came out, replacing them every 2-3 years, so I am have some experience of their capabilities and how they feel.  In 10 years I have never once broken the glass on a watch and I do not wear screen protectors and I am your typical “klutz”.  I agree with another reviewer that these watch glasses are not being replaced with apple quality glass but I am not an expert.Here is the issue with each watchThis watch never charged higher than 94% despite the battery health being greater than 85%.  I thought maybe it was the generic charger so I charged it with my apple watch charger.  This did not fix the issue, and it would still never charge higher than 94% usually stopped around 91% even overnight.  Within 5-6 hours of use we were getting low battery warnings despite using in low power mode all day.I thought we were going to be able to keep this watch, everything seemed to be going well, it charged to 100%, the battery lasted about 10 hours.  Then suddenly it appeared to not turn on and the screen started glitching on and off.  There were no visible signs of damage to the screen or the watch.  However, the screen always felt off and we would have issues with touching and typing on the watch.  He did wear this in the shower.This watch had similar issues to the first watch with battery and maintaining a charge.  However, my son was in the shower and suddenly the watch kept making emergency calls over and over.  So he gets out of the shower and I take off the screen protector and the glass is cracked, despite no damage at all to the screen protector (see photos).  Similar to watch 2, something always felt “off “ about this screen as well.We will see how this all plays out in the next 30 days and I may update my review more positively if the seller stands by their product.  But for now, I cannot recommend anyone taking the risk on these 100% functional refurbished watches. I am waiting to leave seller feedback until I have a resolution.",1.0
Apple Watch Series 5,"Wear this watch everyday and it's super easy to use. Very comfortable - hardly notice it's there most of the time. Durable and connects well. Glad I got it! Wasn't sure when I was getting it, but worked out perfectly!",5.0
Apple Watch Series 5,"My recent acquisition of a refurbished Apple Watch Series 5 presented an interesting balance of value and a minor logistical challenge. The primary appeal of this purchase was the notable cost reduction compared to a new device, and in terms of core functionality, the watch has largely delivered on its promise. The operational performance mirrors that of a new Series 5, exhibiting the expected responsiveness, a high-quality display, comprehensive health and fitness tracking, and seamless integration within the Apple ecosystem.A point of concern, however, arose upon receipt of the product. The watch was packaged solely with the larger of the standard band sizes. Regrettably, this band proved to be unsuitable for my wrist size, necessitating the immediate procurement of a smaller, compatible band. While the initial price point of the refurbished unit was attractive, the unavoidable additional expense for a properly sized band somewhat offsets the initial cost savings.Notwithstanding this issue concerning the provided accessory, the fundamental performance of the refurbished Apple Watch Series 5 has been satisfactory. All advertised features, including GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, and application compatibility, have operated consistently and reliably. Furthermore, the physical condition of the device suggests careful refurbishment, with minimal discernible signs of previous use.In summary, the refurbished Apple Watch Series 5 offers a financially prudent option for individuals seeking the features and capabilities of this particular smartwatch model. While prospective buyers should be prepared for the potential need to purchase a separate band to ensure optimal fit and comfort, the core device itself performs as expected and provides the anticipated user experience.",4.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"Item arrived fast, in standard Renewed packaging.  It charged up to 83% of battery life.  Paired quickly.  On 5th day of use works as a new one and does look virtually like a new one.  It is well worth the price difference, it can be returned within 90 if issues. Very very good option.  Thank you for having it.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"My first renewed product! This watch exceeded the description. The 41mm screen is easy to see and for my medium wrist it fits perfect. The screen displays the apps clearly & with large icons. This is my first time switching watches- it was super easy! The watch ported over all my data (settings, display, etc) from my 38mm Series 2. There were no scratches on the face and back, but microscopic superfical scratches on the body. A case & band covers the scratches perfectly. I will update my review if necessary.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"The watch came in very good condition. No major scuffs or scratches. Only some very very minor imperfections that are barely noticeable.I was nervous at first because it was very difficult to get the watch to hold a charge. It was barely charging at all the first hour or so, stuck at about 30%. I left it alone and in low power mode for about 2 hours and once it made it to 50%, it updated to the latest version and started gradually charging normally. The battery health is definitely not the best and it could probably be replaced, but it is still very much functional as is.I’ve had it for a few weeks now, and it charges pretty quick, like within an hour to 80%. The charge lasts a long while. I’m a nurse and it can last longer than a 12 hour shift on a full charge. it helps to use Low power mode. I have not had any other issues with it so far. Overall, I would say it is definitely renewed, but worth the discounted price.",4.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"After trying it for 3 weeks. I finally decided to return it. And here is why, and hopefully it will help someone who is planning to buy it. It could be a keeper for you but unfortunately not for me.Good part:The conditions of the watch itself is pretty good. There is no scratch or damage. Watch functions no problem, everything works pretty good. Plus it is cellular version.Bad part:None of the accessories are original, including band and charger plugs box. Which is actually pretty upset for me since I thought for an excellent condition watch at least some original parts. The charger comes with it has a crack on it and not factory. Which means it can’t fast charge the watch. Also it generates a lot of heat which feels pretty dangerous for me. Also the battery health is only 83% which is a lot worse than I thought.Overall I realized I really don’t need cellular, and without fast charging charger and only 83% battery health. It can barely last a day if want to track your sleep. And you need to spare some time for charging. Considering now you can get a brand new SE2 for the same price. I’m not sure if $180 for a three year old watch is worth it.",3.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"When I receive the watch, I was pleasantly surprised to find it was in almost like new condition. I’ve had the watch now for over a week and it has worked flawlessly. I’m very pleased with the money that I saved over a new watch and this was an upgrade from the series 6 I had had previously. Yes I would buy this again.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"My apple watch series 7 with cellular and gps completely broke the back panel came off. I have had this apple watch for 3 yrs since 2022, and the apple store genius bar said they could not fix it I would need to buy another apple watch.  I did not want to invest in a new upgraded watch since I have not upgraded my iphone as yet.  I looked here and saw that AMAZON offered refurbished good and RENEWED.  I decided to buy the RENEWED apple watch that stated looks like new and I must say I am SURPRISED that it works and looks new it came packaged well and with a charging cord. It is always a risk buying anything refurbished so I was not expecting much.  I must say I am really happy I decided to go with the renewed refurbished no scratches no dents the band is new that it came with, IPaired it and waited 2 days to write  my review. The key to sabing battery life is to put your watch on low battery it saves the battery I did that with my other apple watch.  The reason why my other apple watch broke was due to me removing the bands every day and dropping the apple watch to many times. Lets see how long this one last. I decided not to change the bands everyday on this one and try not to drop it frequently. This should last until I get an iphone upgrade and watch.  Again I am pleased with this purchase.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"Value for money:If you want a new Apple Watch but don’t need the latest model, a refurbished one is a great alternative. Being that it was refurbished and such a low price, I was a little skeptical of the condition of the watch and if it would work. It does have a few minor scratches, but otherwise works wonderfully compared to the Series 3 I replaced. Super glad I got this and didn’t pay an arm and a leg for a “new” watch.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"My watch looked clean and new, you would swear it was brand new.My only issue is that it came with no battery at all so I had to charge, but the disappointment was that the charger it came with was not functioning at all.

Apple Watch Series 6,"Got a watch that was pretty much flawless. Everything synced up with no issues. Charged it up and went through setting's to set it up the way I wanted it. Battery holds good charge. It’s still a gamble buying used, but I got a really good one.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 6,"I wish I had images- I would have if they had not readily accepted my request to return they day it arrived. This product is advertised as excellent condition- it could not be further from that. To begin, a came with some minor scratches- okay, that's not too big a deal, I'm gonna buy a case for it anyway. Then, as I am setting up the watch , I notice that the screen physically moves into the watch as I press buttons. It was pretty dark in my room, so I turn on the lights, take a closer look and it appears that either A) The screen had come off and they had tried to glue it back together with the equivalent of elementary Elmer's glue OR B) The Apple Watch adhesive had been extremely used and worn out- to the point where the adhesive was ""leaking"" over the edges of the screen- something fatal they failed to inspect. I am almost sure it is the former given that the adhesive seems it was applied as the real apple watch adhesive is located inside the lining of the screen rather than on its outside edges. Obviously, this scenario is far worse and demonstrates the carelessness of this company. This I presume would be a major compromise of the waterproof aspect of the watch as under the screen, all of the mechanics are exposed to the elements. Cases are often not waterproof either for the Apple Watch since the watch itself is already waterproof, so that would not fix the issue. Now, I did request to refund the day of, reporting the exact issue, and wow! They accepted! Happy Ending! Not quite.As you might expect, the customer service was not great either.I will admit that I physically returned it a few weeks after- I was terribly busy and this apple watch that I was already promised a refund for was not at the top of my list of concerns. By the way- the deadline was in late December. I had returned it in the first third of the time they wanted it back. Fast-forward, and I see that they had charged me a ""restocking fee"" of HALF OF PRICE OF THE WATCH. I payed $270 for this ""excellent condition"" device only to be dealt a hole of $135 in the wallet. I was essentially paying to repair the watch, and for them to sell it to another poor soul. The cost to actually repair it is much cheaper by the way, and you could probably do a better job. Nowhere do they mention a restocking fee, especialIy not such a large one. I, obviously angry, had to control myself when talking to their customer service- which was hardly a service and more of an insult. I asked for a full refund in what one would consider polite given the circumstances. Here's the kicker. They had the AUDACITY to claim that I, MYSELF, had broken it because it was not returned immediately after receival. Don't be mistaken, they would likely come up with another excuse to only refund you half of your money even if you returned it earlier than myself. The apple watch was not used a single day after my initial complaint, yet the customer service had the incredible nerve to claim that it was my fault. They somehow believe that I had bought the watch, and planned to break and return it. They genuinely believe that somebody would buy the watch and report damage the day after so that they could use it for a month, THEN break it in the exact way as described, THEN return it. Not even a legitimate scammer would plan that- logically, its just not cost efficient, practical, or useful. The customer service was vague and almost condescending.Just because they have some sort of Amazon Renewed Certification does not mean it will be anywhere close to ""like new"" or excellent folks. You would think that for a company selling the same items tagged in progressively ascending order of quality (They have the same watch at different prices for ""good"" ""Very Good"" and ""Excellent"") would have an at least decent ""Excellent"" option. What an absolute joke and a horrible experience to ruin my week.Just don't risk it. Heads you get an overpriced used Apple Watch. Tails, you dig yourself a $135 hole.",1.0
Apple Watch Series 6,"There was not a scratch or blemish on this renewed Series 6 apple watch.  The only sign of aging was its max battery life was only about 89%.

Apple Watch Series 7,"If I could give ZERO STARS, I WOULD. This is hands down the WORST purchase I have ever made on Amazon. I bought this pre-owned Apple Watch in October, and from DAY ONE, the screen started peeling off. NOT EVEN A MONTH IN, and the watch was falling apart before my eyes. This is not normal wear and tear—this is cheap, lazy, bare-minimum refurbishment meant to last JUST long enough to clear the 30-day return window.I reached out to the seller? They told me to go to Amazon. Amazon? No help. I am warning you now: DO NOT EXPECT CUSTOMER SERVICE. This seller is running a quick-cash scam, selling barely-functioning products, and banking on the fact that you won’t notice the defects in time.If you see ANY AIR BUBBLES under your screen, RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY. Don’t convince yourself that it’s nothing—it means your watch is already breaking apart. And don’t expect a refund, because once you’re past that return window, you are stuck with their garbage.I don’t care if they sell this watch for HALF PRICE—it’s NOT WORTH IT. Whether it’s for you, a loved one, young or old, this will ONLY cause frustration and disappointment. Your money is TOO HARD-EARNED to waste on a scam.From now on, I’M ONLY BUYING FROM APPLE DIRECTLY. I will NEVER again put money into this ripoff seller’s pocket, and I strongly advise you to do the same.SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY, THE STRESS, AND THE ANGER—DO NOT BUY.",1.0

Apple Watch Series 7,"Needed a newer Apple Watch so I can do ecgs to share with my doctor. I didn’t want to shell out a shirt load of money for a new one. Saw these renewed ones for a fraction of the price. I ordered one and 2 days later, it showed up. It was in a plain box and had a charger with it. Good thing because it was dead as I’ve ever seen anything dead. It charged up in an hour or so I could get it set up.I inspected it. There are wear marks on the case and crown but the face was fine. I put a screen and case protector on it and it looks fine.I checked the battery life and it’s down to 85%. I’m sure that’s going to be fine. I know it can be replaced it I want to later.The sports band is not an Apple product but I don’t care. I quit buying Apple Watch bands years ago. I can buy 3 or 4 of these perfectly fine knockoffs for the price of one Apple.Other than the scuffs and battery it works as it should.Down with overpriced stuff and thumbs up for cheaper rebuilt semi quality stuff. Kinda like a rebuilt transmission.*****UPDATE*****As for the functionality of the watch, it's fine except for the battery life.  I have to charge it part way through the day IF I want it to last all day.  On more than one occasion, by 4:00 pm, I got the 10% battery left message and then it is dead until I get it on a charger.  Now, I'm going to have to spend $100 to get the battery replaced.AND - the watch charger that came with it, does not work.  Yes, I took the piece of plastic off of it before trying it out.  I'm beginning to regret my purchase.I guess I could see if I can replace the battery myself but I don't want to perform surgery on a piece of electronics at my age.  The battery will be around $25 and the tool kit will be around $30 plus shipping and handling.  Still saving money though.  Maybe I can start a side hustle replacing apple watch batteries and save enough to go on vacation in the tropics or buy a small can of pineapple juice.Buyers remorse is setting in. REMOVE A STAR!*****UPDATE #2*****Found a video tutorial that walked me through turning off a number of the functions of the watch to save on battery.  I am pleased to report that after doing that, I can now wear it 10 or 11 hours and the watch will still have mid 70's battery left.  I shouldn't have to do this but I did so Now I can wear it and not worry about taking a charger to work with me so I can charge it over my lunch break.",3.0

Apple Watch Series 8,"I paid extra for “Premium “ grade renewed Apple watch 8, which according to Amazon criteria definition will be fully functional and in one of four conditions. Premium being the best and most expensive.Premium Condition is defined as NO signs of cosmetic damage ie scratches, dents, etc.. mine had a very noticeable gouge in the top of the case, see pic.Battery should be 90% or greater of original battery life. Mine was 88 .Accessories original equipment manufacturer. Mine didn’t have the high speed charger in the product description, rather a cheap basic watch charger and cheap silicon band. The band I can understand.There was no oxygen sensor as described in watch description. The compass feature/function was broken. This was not the” premium” product that I paid extra for.Also heads up they way over charge for sales tax. And do not refund the difference of what it really is and the much bigger amount that you will get charged.This is my first experience with Amazon Renewed.

Apple Watch Series 6,"UPDATE:  I have now had the watch for roughly 2 months.  I’ve decided to knock out an update a month early.This watch is incredible.  I have done the following since having the watch:SwimmingCold plungingWorking out (weights)RunningSleeping (sleep monitoring)CampingHot tubOutdoor work (chopping wood, cleaning a nasty chicken coop, setting up a treestand)HikingDishesShoweringGardeningWake boardingPaddle boardingKayakingCliff jumpingFree diving (to 20-25 feet)I’m sure there is more but I wanted to emphasize I’ve done A LOT with this watch.  I also did a run on the beach but I took the watch off when going in the ocean.  I possibly didn’t need to but salt water is just so corrosive I didn’t want to risk it.This watch has performed flawlessly the entire time.  I’m more than impressed.  My son bought one of these new when they first came out and paid double what I paid.My cons list is short: (and really not the seller but the watch itself)I didn’t realize if you have a tattoo where the sensor sits it will not read correctly.  I thought something was wrong with my watch but did a little research and found it was the tattoos on my wrist…I verified this by moving the watch to an area with then without and watching the watch shut off.  I now choke the watch up a little closer to my hand (which can be annoying sometimes when working out) and it works perfectly.  Also…I think sunscreen might affect the sensor as well.  I had sunscreen on and the watch was doing a similar thing that it did with the tattoo.  I wiped the sensor and my wrist off and it started working fine.Lastly I do wish the watch came with a little better charger…the one they sent me works just fine but it’s slow as can be.  The charger my son has charges our watched in 1.5-2 hours.Overall…everything I’ve said below is just as (if not more) relevant.  I wouldn’t hesitate to buy this watch again.  I’m extremely satisfied.I would have shared a picture or 2 but amazon asked permission to all my pictures and that isn’t happening.I’m writing this knowing I’ve only had the watch for 3 days.  I plan to update my review before the 90 day return runs out and after I’ve had more time with the watch.I got this watch specifically from seller prime mobility.  They have very high feedback ratings so I was happy to take a chance with them in this watch.  I bought the watch in “like new” condition.  The seller was prompt with shipping and communication.  At this point I would recommend them highly.The watch: blue series 6I did a lot of research on what watch to get for fitness and overall health.  It seems with all my research, for people who aren’t super techy and have an iPhone the Apple Watch is the way to go.  I’ve never owned an apple or any other smart watch/smart device.  I wanted this to track my 5 day a week gym workouts, sleep, and heart rate with running, meditation, and cold plunging.I honestly only have 1 con at this point.  The watch came with a sticker right on the health tracker and the glue was annoying (really not hard just annoying) to have to remove.The pros are many: the watch came with %100 battery health witch I was surprised about.  I’ve been using it and I’ve only had to charge it every 1.5 days.  It also looks great.  No visible issues, problems, blemishes at all.  Lastly, the first day I had it I did a 10 minute cold plunge.  The watch was under water for 10 minutes and had no issues.  The watch quality meets my expectations completely and even exceeded them regarding battery life.  I’m incredibly happy with my purchase.  I can’t speak for other sellers but I feel prime mobility did me well in this purchase.  Again, I will be updating my review before the 90 day return runs out but at this point I don’t have any concerns or apprehensions.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 6,I never owned an Apple Watch until I had to switch back to an iPhone. I was looking around and found the series 6. I wanted an older series but some of them were surprisingly expensive and I think I was looking at a series 7 and that was pricey as well. I got this at an excellent price to be fair. It works great with my iPhone 12. It did come a bit banged up but I bought it used so I can’t have high expectations on it. But nothing too crazy on it being banged up. The glass screen did have damage it wasn’t cracked or anything like that it almost looked kinda scraped. It fits me well. I got it in black color which was what I wanted.,5.0
Apple Watch Series 6,"I purchased this ""renewed in excellent condition"" Apple Watch Series 6 (44mm Aluminum) in October 2024 as a Christmas gift for my husband. He was thrilled at first, and the watch appeared to be in great condition. Unfortunately, we now realize that the product quality was only surface-deep.He had less than two weeks to truly vet the watch before the 3-month return window ended on January 9. On June 23—his first time wearing it into a swimming pool—the watch completely died. It has not turned on since. Apple clearly advertises this model as water resistant up to 50 meters, so this should have been a non-issue.After examining the watch, it's obvious the failure was due to poor workmanship during the ""renewal"" process. The casing still looks pristine with no dents or cracks, but water somehow got in. I can literally hear it sloshing inside—proof it wasn’t properly resealed during refurbishment.When I contacted the seller, they refused to help since the return window had closed months earlier. That’s extremely frustrating, especially given that the defect wasn’t something that could have been detected earlier without intentionally submerging it.I strongly caution others against trusting the “renewed” label from this seller. Appearances may be deceiving, and the lack of accountability is unacceptable.",1.0

Every time I would wear it with it fully being charged, it would drain so quickly and heat up on my wrist. I came to find out that the battery was needing service and it was not operating above 75%. I thought about possibly getting it replaced/repaired, but what I would pay wouldn't be worth it for me to take it in somewhere to possibly get it replaced, given how much I paid for it initially. Also, I noticed there were scratches on the crown and the sides. While I knew it wouldn't look perfectly brand new, I wonder how 'refurbished' can mean poorly done. I am very disappointed.",1.0

Apple Watch Se,"Product was sold to me defective. The product would turn off and on even when fully charged or when trying to start a workout or to play music. So pretty much whenever. The watch would die super fast. When connected to a charger the battery percentage would go up and down. Even taking it to Apple and getting it shipped to a repair center, the watch still doesn’t work and is now having trouble pairing to my phone because it continues to turn off and on. Very dissatisfied and disappointed. When reaching out to the seller they have yet to still reach back out to me.",1.0
Apple Watch Se,"It came in a plain box. I have never owned much less seen an Apple Watch before but it was way past time for a new watch. Since I’ve owned an iPhone for a few years now I thought I’d take the dive and buy one. It isn’t the latest on the market but how would I know that? I got it because of the health benefits. It can even map my steps like when I walk my dog. That’s something my fitbit never did. I can change the watch face to anything in the watch library.It was super easy to pair with my phone. I started charging it as soon as I got the watch band put on. I even got a watch face protector and put that on before I got it set up to charge.It says it’s supposed to take 2.5 hours to charge to full but I think because I ended up updating and syncing and pairing it with my iPhone it didn’t charge full in that time. So I was impatient and started wearing it at 58% charged. I read you’re not supposed to let it drain down to zero or it could ruin your battery. Also that it’s ok to charge over night because there is a shutoff when it is full. Same with an iPhone which I did not know. Learn something new everyday right?The other thing I learned is I don’t need to add it to my phone like add another line and pay $10 extra just so I can answer my phone with my watch and leave my phone at home. Since I retired I don’t use my phone enough to warrant that service.I like that I can add my meds I take and set an alarm for them. There’s a lot of stuff that I like about the fitness and health aspect of it.I’m still learning about it and there’s so much to learn. The easiest thing was pairing it with my phone because once it was charged enough to turn on it did and my phone was sitting nearby and it flashed a screen quickly all I seen was click pair phone and the screen changed because I was downloading watch faces. I like that there is an instruction manual linked so if you have questions you can click on the manual link and open the booklet. It’s really small print so you have to pinch the screen to enlarge it big enough to read on your phone.It reads in the manual that the battery drains faster when you have more apps on it working and open. Like : notify for text messages; automatic downloads, those kinds of things and you can turn them off so it doesn’t drain your battery as fast.It’s supposed to last 18 hours from a full charge but that depends on usage. Like do you FaceTime often, use it for phone calls instead of phone, listening to music/podcasts? Because if so that cuts down on the 18hr charge time.I read that these watches can last up to 5-6 years before they don’t work no more and that’s if you take care of it properly. Batteries can be replaced. Bands are interchangeable. I recommend getting a screen protector for the watch face. It’s easy to snap on.I think because I bought excellent condition refurbished which is kinda like brand new at least I think it is, that I won’t have the problems I see other people having like only working for a few months or not charging after a week. That charger is small and I am not sure exactly where to set it. The screen goes black after a few seconds so I don’t know if it’s charging. I’m sure there’s a way to see from my phone but like I said I just got it today and just barely finished setting it up as best I could with everything I think I can.So far I’m loving the watch! I’m a former android user slowly over the past 10 years I been moving over to Apple products. This watch being my latest piece to my collection.My best advice when shopping refurbished is are you really going to buy an acceptable item because it’s even cheaper than the good, or excellent? And then come complain because it arrived with scratches or something. You get what you pay for I was always told. So read the description before you add to cart, make sure you know exactly what you’re paying for.",4.0

Apple Watch Ultra,"Like most on here I was a bit apprehensive about buying a refurb Ultra, I was pleasantly surprised. Cosmetically the watch was perfect, no blemishes or scratches at all, looked brand new from factory level. It did take most of the day to charge the battery but I've since seen it charge more quickly now. Battery Health is 93% so decent. No regrets on this purchase and am happy with the Ultra its a nice upgrade and looks great with the Ocean band strap.",5.0
Apple Watch Ultra,"When I received the watch it was completely dead, the charger supplied with the watch is not a genuine apple charger and took forever to start the watch, then I switched to the apple genuine charger and it started charging immediately.  I had to install the latest update before it can set up the watch, but once everything was installed the watch works great.  I received it in pristine condition, I even like the band it came with. The Battery Life is at 99% which is considered new.  So this review is three days after I received the watch.  Hopefully I won’t be revisiting this post to post anything other than the above. This watch is a beast! Great price as well.Update: I’ve had the watch for aMonth and a half now and I love the watch.  Again other than the charger the watch looks new as does the band.",5.0
Apple Watch Ultra,"It was time to buy an Apple Watch.  The Ultra seemed to have all the features and *in my mind* the smaller ""regular"" models were a compromise of sorts.  But the new Ultra II watches are VERY expensive.  Not in my budget and in my mind not a good value.  But I think I found the value I needed.I researched Ultra I vs Ultra II (and the Series 10) watches and decided that while the Ultra II has more features and a ""faster processor"", these weren't things that I *needed*.  It came with features that are not automtically included with the Series 10 watches such as titanium frame. An extra control button, and a few minor other things.It appeared that the ""renewed"" watches seemed to have a good track record and one came along with a band that I liked and I jumped on it.I like this watch.  Big learning curve, but I'm settling in.  The unit I received seems to be in perfect condition, with a plastic protector over the face. No scratches or any marks that I can see. The one thing that surprised me, but just a little, is that it came in a crappy generic box. Nothing like how Apple packages their products. But I won't be wearing the box, so who cares.  It also came with a little charging disk/cord that looks like an EKG sensor.  The charging thing works, but I bought an inexpensive night stand charger which I like.One of the ingenious things about the Apple Watch is their approach to watch bands.  I like the one that came with it, but to change a band is easy and takes only seconds.  I ordered 3 more bands, but just sent back on.  So many to choose from. The bands change the whole character of the watch, and I can set matching watch faces.  So much fun to be able to take one watch and inexpensively give it so many looks.I reserve 5 star rating for only outstanding products.  I give this 4.5 stars, because the cheap packaging ruined the overall gestalt of receiving a watch that costs this much money.",4.0
Apple Watch Ultra,"I recently decided to upgrade my smartwatch and was torn between a refurbished Apple Watch Ultra (AWU) and the Apple Watch Series 10 Cellular. After some deliberation, I chose the AWU, and I’m glad I did.The watch arrived in pristine condition—no scratches, dents, or signs of prior use. The battery health was at 91%, which is virtually new. It came with the Ocean Band, which was brand new and adds to the premium feel of the watch. While the included 1m Magnetic Charging Cable didn’t seem to be an original Apple product, it wasn’t a deal-breaker for me.Setting up the watch was a breeze. Adding it to my US Mobile account was straightforward, and as a Premium customer, there’s no extra charge for Apple Watch connectivity—a fantastic perk! The watch performed flawlessly when making calls, sending texts, and streaming music. Everything worked as advertised, and the experience has been seamless so far.Overall, I’m thrilled with my decision. The Apple Watch Ultra offers premium features and durability at an excellent value. For anyone considering a refurbished model, I’d say go for it—I would definitely buy it again!",5.0
Apple Watch Ultra,"I really wanted to give it 4 stars because of the garbage charger that it comes with and cuz it takes forever to turn on because it’s completely dead and also need quite some time to get it updated along with my iPhone to the latest firmware. But after all of that crazy crap and with the help of my series 7 charger, once everything was setup (took me about 2-4 hours I lost track) and it works properly, this refirb Apple Watch Ultra 1 is a fantastic, reliable and still very timeless. Everything still works, it’s still very quick and snappy and mine came with 100% on its battery health which is great and pretty hard to find. I was skeptical about buying it but thankfully all the other reviews are spot on, just remember to get a screen protector (or a case if you want) and an authentic Apple charger with the USB-C pin for the best/fastest charging speed.",5.0
Apple Watch Ultra,It was a great watch just too big and bulky for me. The watch worked the way it was supposed to and the band was beautiful. It was super easy to set up and get running.

Apple Watch Series 9,"I was VERY leery of purchasing a refurbished Apple watch from Amazon, however I was pleasantly surprised. We ordered a 41mm Series 9 GPS + Cellular watch.The watch came in an aftermarket, nondescript box so when my kid opened the gift their response to seeing it was a little lackluster. However, when they actually got into the box, they were overjoyed.We have owned the watch for a little over 4 months now and it charges every evening and functions to full capacity.  The battery life easily lasts all day and it's on a mix of cellular and wifi with no issues.The screen is scratch free and the touch functionally works well. We had no issues hooking up the cellular aspect and pairing the watch.In addition to the nondescript packaging, the watch came with an aftermarket black band with two length options, and a charger.  The aftermarket band came apart in just a couple of weeks but we were able to purchase a better replacement, but keep that in mind when purchasing.Overall we are pleased with the quality of the watch, including its like new appearance, for the value.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 9,"The Apple Watch Series 9 is easily the best Apple Watch I’ve owned so far. It’s noticeably faster and more responsive, thanks to the upgraded S9 chip. Apps open quickly, animations are super smooth, and Siri works faster than ever—even handling some requests without needing your iPhone nearby.The display is bright and crystal-clear, even in direct sunlight, and the always-on feature is incredibly useful. I also love the Double Tap gesture—it makes answering calls or pausing music feel effortless when your hands are full. Health and fitness tracking is as detailed and accurate as you'd expect, with new features like better sleep tracking and cycle insights.Battery life is solid and easily gets me through a full day, even with heavy use. Plus, it pairs seamlessly with my iPhone and other Apple devices, making it a great addition to the Apple ecosystem.If you're upgrading from an older model or buying your first Apple Watch, the Series 9 is a smart, stylish, and powerful choice that delivers on performance and convenience.",5.0

Apple Watch Series 6,"As a refurbished watch, it’s decent for what I use it for. I’ve had it for just about a year, but the battery life has declined significantly in that time. When I first got it, I would need to charge it every 2 days or so. Now I’m lucky if it lasts 24 hours without dying. It also takes about 8 hours to fully charge now too, which is frustrating. I like it much better than the Fitbit I had previously, it’s miles ahead of that thing. I’ve never had any connectivity issues, it has always worked seamlessly with my phone. I bought different stretchy bands for it because the silicone band it came with was horribly uncomfortable. Overall, I think I would purchase it again.",3.0

Apple Watch Series 8,"This watch has all the bells and whistles of a new apple watch but without the price tag. LOVE A REFURBISHED Deal. Felt good rehoming this beauty.Battery life is Ok, had to get used to charging it every two days. I went from a fitbit to an applewatch and there is for sure a learning curve. Both with the functionality and the user interface. I used it as I was training for a marathon. It monitored all my health metrics and alerted when I was in need of a rest day. The fit was great, and I chose to protect the touch screen with a cover. It limits the functionality slightly. But the benefits greatly outweigh the drawbacks. It was a good buy.-heads up, it often delivers with no battery charge. Charging can take up to 24hrs. Be patient, put it on the charger and let it be.",5.0

The battery health is at 86% which isn’t bad.,5.0
Apple Watch Series 8,"Physical condition was totally fine in appearance, no scratches or anything. But things you should know:1. The battery health shows max charge of 83%, which is not great. According to the Amazon Renewed info page, this falls short of the ""Premium"" and ""Excellent"" condition, placing it in the ""Good"" category if we only look at battery health metric.2. The charging cable it came with is terrible, super cheap and takes ages to charge. It may be ""good enough"" to do in a pinch, but expecting to spend an additional $30 or so for a proper one (especially considering the limited battery capacity).3. The ECG works on only about 1/10 attempts. The rest of the time it glitches out. Idk whether this issue is on Apple's end with an unreliable app, or whether the hardware supporting this feature is degraded on the device itself. I suspect the internals to measure this are fragile and susceptible to damage from drops.4. Verizon customers, beware: I have been unable to connect cellular service (see image). Unclear whether this is an issue on Verizon's end, or if the ""Renewing"" process didn't also clear up associations with the device's IMEI number (i.e. it's already been bound to another carrier or something). I have an iPhone SE (3rd gen), which, according to both Apple and Verizon, should be fully compatible.Considering: Is it worth the hassle of returning this one and ordering another? How likely is it that the next one will be any better?",3.0

It only lasted about 3-4 hours fully charged.HOWEVER, after going through and TURNING OFF background app refresh and other background processes, as well as REMOVING UNNECESSARY APPS, the BATTERY LIFE IMPROVED DRASTICALLY. It has NOT EVEN hit 75% after a FULL 8 HOURS. I think the battery life is really impressive!COSMETICALLY:This watch is in REALLY GOOD condition considering it is secondhand/refurbished. I received mine with only ONE TINY CHIP to the screen.**I genuinely think this is not a watch to pass up.

I needed to upgrade to Watch OS 10.3 but that went very quickly.  Pairing with iPhone wasn’t a problem either.  Battery health measured 99%.  The ONLY issue that I had was with the enclosed wireless watch charger that came with the watch.  This charger was NOT an Apple or certified Apple charger.  This was an unmarked, no company name or logo 3rd party unit from Asia.  This charger would literally “cook” the watch when in use.  Thanks to Apple for installing a thermal shutdown in the watch otherwise I would of had a lithium battery fire on my kitchen counter.  The watch would shutdown the charging process but still was very “hot” to the touch.  Some of these wireless battery chargers are ONLY rated for 5W using USB-C.  Good luck finding a 5W power unit.  I had one from an old Apple 6 phone that I was able to use and purchased a USB-A male to USB-C female adaptor to use as a watch charger unit.  DO NOT USE THE STANDARD 20W OR LARGER POWER UNITS.  Thermal shutdown will happen during charging.  Please don’t leave the watch unattended while using these non-standard, un-certified wireless chargers.Overall I am very happy with the purchase with pricing point that I paid.  I didn’t need the extra adventure of the wireless charging unit.  Too much drama to an otherwise great transaction.",5.0

The back of the watch had a QC sticker on it.  Weeks later I am still trying to get the adhesive residue off the watch, which is really annoying.

I requested a replacement, hoping for better, but the second unit arrived in even worse cosmetic condition, with a battery health of just 87%.If a product is labeled “Excellent,” I expect minimal signs of use and a battery health that reflects that—typically 95% or higher. In both cases, the watches clearly showed signs of prior use, and the battery performance did not meet the standard implied by the description.I think it’s only fair to buyers that the condition rating be more transparent and accurate.

Battery life is 87% which also surprised me. I could live with those but the top of the touch screen isn’t working, can’t hit the exit button to or even the restart button. Will have to return.",3.0

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"Amazon reviewI've never owned a smart watch because I'm really hard on watches and I just thought they were expensive, fragile gadgets. When my wife got one for health reasons, I saw how useful the watch was and how many ways I could use it.I started looking on Amazon, found the refurbished watches on Woot (Amazon) , found a good price on an Ultra 2 gps+cellular and ordered one. I really love this watch. I love the bigger face, longer battery life and extra features. As stated in the description, the watch was in excellent condition.After it arrived, I wore it a couple of days to make sure it was what I wanted and that it felt good on my wrist. I liked wearing the watch. I ordered a watch face protector because of my bad luck of banging my watches into every hard object I get near. The protector fits great and isn't noticeable on the watch. I also ordered a heavier duty watch band so I wouldn't lose it  during hikes and bike rides.I use it for monitoring my health and tracking my sleep and exercise routine. It is easy to start and finish any type of exercise you know of and many you don't. Knowing how much exercise I'm actually doing during the day keeps me from sitting in the chair too long. It also makes it fun competing against myself.I put the watch on my cellular service and it works well. I enjoy having access to my phone and many apps without bringing my iPhone.Based on my experience, I definitely recommend the refurb watch. No problems and it came in an excellent, like new condition. I also recommend the Ultra 2 for watch face size, longer battery and low power mode, brighter screen, waterproof depth and ruggedness.",5.0
Apple Watch Ultra 2,"Have had apple watch for years now. Thought I would try an ultra as I found a refurbished one for great price. This thing is mint. Not a single scratch on it and operates perfectly. Battery has been lasting x2+ longer than my regular watch 8 series. I regularly walk when golfing and start an outdoor walk. With the 8 series, the battery was nearly dead after half a round. Now this ultra battery goes through the hole round and a second day before needing a charge. Very happy.",5.0
Apple Watch Ultra 2,"I was initially hesitant about purchasing a renewed version of the Apple Watch Ultra 2. I wasn’t sure if the “expertly refurbished” label would live up to the standards I expect from Apple products. However, after using it extensively for a week, I’m glad to say that my concerns subsided. Here’s what I’ve liked so far, along with a few areas where there’s room for improvement.Likes:Impressive Performance: Despite being a renewed product, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 performs flawlessly. It's fast, responsive, and handles multitasking like a champ. Whether I’m switching between apps, tracking a workout, or using it for notifications, it’s smooth sailing.Fitness Tracking: This watchOS has completely changed how I track my fitness. The precision of the heart rate monitor, GPS, and various workout modes ensures I’m getting accurate data, which has helped me optimize my training.Health Features: The health tracking features are top-notch. The ECG, and sleep tracking are incredibly insightful, helping me stay on top of my health metrics.Battery Life: I’m pleasantly surprised by the battery life. It easily lasts a couple of days of heavy use, and with lighter use, I can stretch it to almost 2-3 days before needing a charge. Had the Apple Watch series 7 before and it barely lasted a full day.Seamless Integration with Other Devices: As someone who uses multiple Apple products, the Apple Watch Ultra 2 integrates seamlessly with my iPhone, AirPods, and MacBook.Dislikes:Renewed Product Hesitancy: While the renewed version has performed well, there’s still a bit of anxiety in the back of my mind about long-term durability. However, the watch came in excellent condition with no visible wear and tear, so I’m cautiously optimistic.Screen Responsiveness: One major drawback I’ve noticed is that the screen becomes less responsive when my fingers are sweaty during running. This can be frustrating when trying to interact with the watch during a run. I hope this is something that can be improved with software updates, but it’s a noticeable inconvenience.Battery Life: Both a like and a dislike: While the Apple Watch Ultra 2 has more battery life than my recent Apple Watch, it pales in comparison to competitors like Garmin, which can last up to two weeks on a single charge.Overall: I’m incredibly satisfied with my purchase. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 (Renewed) has exceeded my expectations, and I’m confident it will continue to serve me well in my fitness, health, and everyday tech needs. If you’re on the fence about a renewed product, this one is definitely worth considering.",5.0
Apple Watch Ultra 2,"So far so good. I’ve bought a few “renewed” (used) items from Amazon and had good luck. Watch came as described. Listed as great shape, it had no blemishes and is working well. Love the bigger design and the “always on” option so I don’t have to wake it up.  Battery is a mystery however. Some days it lasts forever and others seem to drain quicker. I can’t see a reason for it to last longer or shorter. The days seem comparable in my movement and usage. Coming from a series 7 to an ultra two feels quite different. Much larger, much larger battery, a few additional features but same overall quality.For a few hundred dollars less the renewed option was a good choice.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"So, I decided to get an Apple Watch after my Garmin broke in a restaurant over the holidays. Not to get into it, but their support was horrible and I decided to jump ship.Purchased an 8SE in January and it was great— but I didn’t realize that the SE doesn’t have a keyboard for typing.Returned and purchased this series 7 cellular later in January for about $20-$30 more than the SE was.  It was a certified refurbished purchase and, while it was not eligible for Apple care, it was sold with a comparable 2 year warranty with Amazon.  I was a bit nervous, but it came in perfect condition with a perfect battery.I do have to charge every day, or every 2 days if I remember to turn on low power and other energy-saving modes at night.  I don’t wear in bed.About 10 months in I’m at 94% battery capacity from 100% when I got it.  Do I wish it stayed charged longer?  Sure!  I have to remember to charge it if it’s low and I’m planning on working out, but you just get used to it.Glad I purchased cellular because, even though I didn’t connect it for months, it gave me the option.  I hope to keep the watch long term.Glad I took the chance with return because I’ve had no issues!Series 7 is fantastic and has everything I need (fitness tracking with metrics, general productivity, texts/replies on my watch), and it looks way better than the Garmin as a general watch.  Very easy to swap bands for different occasions or outfits, and there are many options available out there.  I like that I can go from leather band to fabric/silicone easily if I’m getting to work out after work.(As an aside, silver hardware is the better choice generally for Starlight over gold or rose gold if you’d like to match reasonably well)I like to run, do general functional strength training and yoga, and I’ve been happy with Apple for these things.  Plus, it connects to the elliptical at the gym, and runs simultaneous timers when cooking!I recommend both the watch (over my old forerunner 635 and the AW8 SE) and Amazon refurbished.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"You will absolutely love this watch it is in the starlight watched top color. It has features that I will never use, but still can’t believe that a finally got myself this Apple Watch series 7 and because my wrist is small I got the 41 MM’. It comes packaged in the nice box. It has one extra ban but as all the watches no directions but when paired with your phone, which mine is the iPhone, google has every answer that you might want to receive to tell you exactly how to use your watch,  how to look up things on your watch, and just about everything. I did take it to the AT&T store where they paired it with my cell phone showed me a little bit of how to do it, and I wore it out of the store to a lovely dinner where the waiter noticed in complemented me on as nice watch. I have it on now. It does have a keyboard and it also has surgery that you can dictate to Siri and she can type it out and then send it. I just can’t say enough about this lovely watch. Won’t use all the features but at least I have the watch and ordered the smaller face as I said 41mm. The larger face is the most popular, but my wrist as well so the smaller watch face looks great on my watch arm. I suggest if you were on an Apple Watch don’t wait because you never know what something might happen to you and you would never be able to enjoy such a nice piece of high-tech. Whether I want to use all the features or not which or fitness probably heart weight rate and a bunch more but I’m still learning and after having it for just a few days over a week I find that it holds a charge nicely but I have charged it. You will need an adapter to plug in your wire to the adapter to electric outlet. It charges very quickly and once more it is just beautiful and I absolutely love the watch. Younger people know how to operate all these high tech things want us older people doesn’t, but it doesn’t matter. I love it. I think he will love it and there is nothing wrong with this watch. It is absolutely perfect and it is absolutely beautiful and the star light color and a plus is the two bands. The guy in the store changed one side of the band, but it proved that it didn’t work exactly fit right and we tried to change the band and couldn’t so we looked up on Google how to change the Apple Watch band and there it was on the back of the watch. There was a little button that you push and part of the watch band will just slide down as you slide it then you put the other half of the watch band on that bitch your arm, the best it is easy to put on and I promise you will love this watch .",5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"Received it on time. Can be a pain to change straps. Pulse Oximeter is unavailable despite being listed as a feature due to some legal case challenging Apples inclusion of the feature.My device came with less than 90% battery health, which is concerning to say the least. Probably won’t buy from the seller I purchased it from again.Other than these issues it seems to work fairly well so far. I love being able to text from my wrist instead of having to dig out my phone every time. Kinda wish it had more apps but kinda glad it doesn’t since the whole point for me is to lowkey disconnect from my phone/socials.UPDATE:The watch is fine BUT the charger that was included in the order spontaneously self destructed seemingly through overheating randomly four months after I got the watch. It was electrically hot and could have very nearly shocked me on household current when this happened. It was not making contact with anything except a (non conductive) wooden surface at the time this happened.This not only means I’ll have to buy a new charger but it also could have set a fire or sent me to the hospital for electrocution so I’m deducting further stars and the chargers from the reseller should be recalled.",1.0

Apple Watch Series 6,"So, I was ready to get my first Apple watch but had a couple of concerns. First, is that I while I wanted a recent model, I didn't want to spend more than two or three hundred bucks. Second, is that many people mention how easy the regular glass scratches. Third, is that the frosted-metal finish on the standard aluminum case is everywhere and no matter what band you get, they stand out as a smartwatch. Nothing wrong with that, just an aesthetic preference.Ok, so the option offered by Apple is to get a watch with one of the higher grade case materials (stainless steel, titanium, ceramic) which they pair with a sapphire crystal front glass. This takes care of both issues. The stainless steel case, when paired with certain bands, totally passes as a regular watch, and the sapphire crystal is far more difficult to scratch (although they are more brittle, so easier to shatter when dropped).The problem is that the upgraded cases cost way more than the aluminum. That's where buying this watch here really shines. It's just one step down from the latest model, has the stainless steel case with sapphire crystal... all for less than half of what a new one would cost with the upgraded case/crystal. Being refurbished I was fully expecting it to have scratches here and there, but would not have minded unless they were on the glass or if the buttons had any issues, or if the battery were too worn. Well, I'm thrilled to say that the watch I received is just about flawless! No scratches I can see, and the battery health is at 90%.  It does come with an aftermarket band and aftermarket charger, but this is to be expected with refurbs, and both were functional and new. A new leather band cost me about ten bucks (notice in the attached picture how the stainless case helps it pass more as a regular watch with the leather band) and a genuine Apple charger was 20 something, and charges the watch a good bit faster than the included one, so I'll just keep the included one in the car for backup. My plan is to mimic the strategy I use on my phones, which is to not let the battery get below 20% and only charge up to about 80% or so. This extends battery health immensely, compared to letting it get too low or always charging to 100%. All in all, I am very happy with this purchase, and wholeheartedly recommend buying one of these refurbs.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 6,"I purchased a refurbished Apple Watch listed in excellent condition. While the watch looked good it was defective since it was verified by a diagnostics test within days of receiving the watch that it has battery and connectivity issues. Reported this immediately. For the return I was told that UPS would have to pick it up from house and an adult must sign for the return- fine, but I could not be given a window of time for the pickup. So ANYTIME that day. And I cannot take it to the UPS store a mile away. Not my fault I was sold a defective watch and the return process is ridiculous.",1.0
Apple Watch Series 6,"For the cost savings, I got the perfect watch.  Is it free from scratches: no.  Can you see the scratches with your arm held out: yes.  Does it honestly really matter... now that's a personal preference.Prior to purchasing, I thought about my previous stainless steel watches (mechanical).  Very quickly after I got each one, they all got scratches in various locations over time.  So even if I were to plunk down the cash for a new Apple stainless one, it was going to get scratched eventually.  Expectations tempered.Also prior to purchasing, I came up with non-negotiables.  Mainly, if the front crystal was scratched, the back sensors had any scratches, the crown was messed up in any way (difficult to turn, cracked, etc), or if the battery felt it wasn't holding a charge.  It was going to go back if any of those were true.When they dipped to a reasonable price, I bought one.  The one I got (sold by CameraGuyz), has some scratches for sure, mainly on the speaker side of the case, as you can see in the photos, as well as various other places on the case (I did get some stainless polish/repair.  I tried barkeepers friend first, which did help a bit, and between the two, really livened it up).  Battery was good (91%), and the front and back and crown/button were pristine.  Lastly, I called my cell provider and verified that the watch could be hooked up to my plan (had them verify the IMEI wasn't blocked or locked).  Check, check, check!Two weeks in, and still going strong.  I love the look of the stainless, and again, for the money paid, truly an incredible deal.  Highly recommend buying this way.  Save yourself the money, and get it used.  And have some stainless steel polish ready!",4.0

Apple Watch Ultra 2,"I really wanted to write a good review as the watch itself was as advertised and priced reasonably. Unfortunately that's where it ended. The photo and description on the item I ordered clearly stated that it had the ""Titanium Milanese Band"" and ""USB-C"" charger. Neither was true and I tried to work with them to resolve this issue and they refused, falsely claiming that they were not using false advertising and that Apple requires they use this fake band. The band provided was a cheap Chinese steel knockoff of the magnetic style Milanese Loop used on the standard Apple watch series which doesn't suit this watch, not the Ultra Parachute Style real Titanium band one would expect and was shown in their photo (see image). Also, the USB charger is USB-A (not C) so I have to use an adapter. They did offer to refund the watch, but I needed it for a trip and decided to keep it. Hopefully they will change their deceptive marketing practices and try to make good on their promises. If they decide to resolve my concerns I will update my review, but for now BUYER BEWARE!",1.0

Apple Watch Series 8,"As the saying goes, only time will tell, but for now, on day 3, I can share that the Apple Watch Series 8, 41mm GPS + Cellular, ""Excellent Condition,"" arrived, as advertised. There are several sellers under this listing, my order was fulfilled by Woot & shipped by Prime, for reference. At startup, it had 95% battery remaining, and no visible specs or scratches to either the case or crystal. All prior data/user information was wiped & the device was unlocked. The watch surface was completely clean, even free of fingerprints! Keeping in mind that even though stainless models have a more resilient surface and scratch resistance together with a premium sapphire crystal, it could have shown some signs of wear, but didn't! Also enclosed was a startup pamphlet and USB-A charging pad.Sadly, the Pulse Ox function isn't working though it might have, because the watch was delivered with watchOS v11. That’s to be expected with the copyright case still in litigation. I noticed another reviewer said their watch's Pulse Ox works, but it might depend on OS version or region since the lawsuit involves US models. After the initial deep charge, battery capacity dropped 1%, which is what I'll consider as its starting point.I can say with honesty it looks amazing, and as far as durability, it should be a winner given its now 94% battery capacity. I expected some minor cosmetic flaws, and other than the average plastic band and underwhelming generic charging pad, I’m thrilled by it arriving is such pristine condition. I am going to purchase an Asurion plan of coverage.How I charged it & ease of operation:In saying all of that, it required several online searches to get accurate information beyond the included startup guide and Apple's instructions to learn how to setup the watch. Yes, it was tedious and nerve-racking. No fault of Apple's, their documentation is complete, but bringing a fully drained battery up to operation is beyond the User Manual's scope. As it turned out, the issue was that the battery was indeed completely drained. From what I know now, it entered a state that required a 2-1/2 hour deep-charge. The face showed a massive red thunderbolt and no sign of active charging, alternating with the more encouraging charging cable icon. When the watch connected to MagSafe charging pad it didn't show any sign of active charging. I checked Apple Watch subReddit for guidance & one thread said to be patient while allowing it to charge for about 2-3 hours. Apple's site had additional, step-by-step guidelines that were also helpful, but Reddit's information is what gave me hope because Apple's 30 minute charging recommendation (when the red thunderbolt showed) turned out to be too little time for that sort of battery recovery.If you buy one of these watches, what I would recommend is to read the Apple Watch User Guide in advance, because what information arrived with the watch on the brief, 3-step pamphlet (from Kissa Electronics) doesn't represent the entire process or possibility that the battery might be completely drained. The online Apple Watch User Guide suggested trying different chargers, cleaning the charger & watch back, and other tips, but I wasn't prepared for that sort of experience. Since I couldn't verify if the supplied charger was operational, and thinking of one of Apple’s suggestions, I felt more comfortable using my Nubeno 3-in-1 Folding Charging Station's 3W MagSafe pad over the generic MagSafe that was packed in with the watch because I've been using it for several months for my iPhone 16 Pro & AirPods Pro 2's and knew it was functional.After the deep charge, I was pleasantly surprised to see the red thunderbolt icon had vanished and in its place, the Series 8 watch face. All that was left was an OS update, pairing & cellular setup!! YAY. From that point on, my phone & watch took over the procedure and I was able to complete the setup by registering the watch with my cellular carrier. Pairing & activating cellular was flawless.At $222, from the original list price of $699, I think this offer is a wonderful cost-saving option if you aren't wanting a lighter weight aluminum model or newer series.  I am very pleased with the purchase, and though it's too soon to know, it seems like the watch is a fantastic find.",5.0

Apple Watch Series 7,The watch is good but they gave me a charger that didn't work and when I spoke to them about it they didn't get back to me with another charger I didn't like that,3.0
Apple Watch Se,Love my new watch!!! It was time ( no pun intended) to get a new watch. 7 years with the same watch was long enough. It was packaged very well. It was shipped right out and I got it quickly. It works perfect. I’m very happy with my purchase.,5.0
Apple Watch Se,The best quality and affordable!! Charges great and works exactly how I need it to! I have had it since April 2025 and I have had no issues whatsoever.,5.0
Apple Watch Se,"Was in like new condition and works fine. Cheaper than buying the latest, but newer than my previous that was outdated",5.0
Apple Watch Se,"I was a bit nervous to buy a used watch for $175, but it worked great. I scanned the QR code that comes with it and it takes you to a website on how to start up the watch. I love to be able to look at the time anywhere, but also be able to record my workouts, sleep, steps, and view notifications. I always hated having to carry around my phone for just the time, so this is so perfect, I am already used to it after a month and look at my watch for the time even if I don't have it on. I didn't realize how much I missed having a watch till I got this.",5.0
Apple Watch Se,"I love the watch, just the battery life is not what I had hoped for. Lasts all day, and most of the night, when I want to check my sleep time, but doesn't last but maybe 24 hours, and that's when I first got it. Otherwise, the watch itself is great, seems like all other Apple Watch functionality, with accurate step count, and health updates, tracking sleep time, heart rate, BP, mindfullness, etc. The band is very comfortable and looks nice, as I wanted a band that was not white, but a lighter color, so the off white is perfect for me.",4.0

Apple Watch Se,perfect size for a smaller wrist. Comes with all the basics yod need in a smart watch. Battery life is still amazing after 2 years. I can go about 2-3 days on a single charge. It's not bulky or heavy on the wrist.,5.0
Apple Watch Se,"This is hands down one of the greatest tools in my disposal. I didn't understand the hype behind Apple Watches until I recently got my hands on one. I was not sure what to expect so I went with the smaller 40mm watch.  I can say the hype is real. I originally bought this to track my fitness progress as it is something that I have never done before. This has me addicted to the gym and completing monthly challenges. This is also great when going off the grid such as camping, going off road or hiking. I find myself using the built in compass constantly to prevent getting lost in the wild.The only downside of this watch is the battery life. I would like to track my sleeping pattern; however, this rarely happens as after a day of using it the battery dies. That being said the charging is relatively fast, charging a full battery in about an hour and a half.In conclusion, this is a great product that is well worth the hype around it. If I were to change anything it is the size to get more battery life out of this product.",5.0
Apple Watch Se,"I like what the watch does, but the battery life is garbage. I charge it every night now to make sure it’s good for the entire next day. That means I don’t get to use the sleep tracker, which is frustrating. Other device manufacturers have figured out how to make better batteries. Garmin even has a solar-charging watch.That said, it has lasted longer than any of my (original company) Fitbits both in hardware and connectivity. My dog even chewed up the magnetic charger and it still works perfectly. I may look into Garmin brand watches (not Fitbit, which they now own) when it’s time to replace it, though.",4.0
Apple Watch Se,"I love how easy it was to pair the watch with my iPhone and transfer my Steps and Fitness data. I am disciplined with my workouts, but having this watch has made it much easier to stay on track when I don’t feel like being active. Also, the ability to set goals and obtain historical health data is very beneficial.Using the watch instead of carrying my phone throughout the house is great and it keeps my phone from being misplaced or dropped.",5.0
Apple Watch Se,"This watch is amazing for the first time owning an Apple Watch, I’ve noticed that it is a bit different than an IPhone, but it’s easy to get the hang of it, for people that worry about calling or texting you DON’T need the (GPS+Cellular) you just need your phone with a service provider (any) it does need more time to charge and less in battery last, but it’s a deal that you love watch, it has it all",5.0
Apple Watch Se,i love my apple watch i use it everyday and it helps me keep track of my calories and my heart rate i would recommend this apple watch for anyone that goes to the gym or even just daily use it has so many features that are useful for everyone this was worth the buy!!!,5.0
Apple Watch Series 8,"This isn't a long term review, but if anything changes I'll update it.  As of now the watch is amazing.  I see after one person mentioned presentation, that improved greatly with mine lol.  Packaging aside, everything is working great, battery life is 100%.  The entire watch looks and feels brand new from the apple store.  The first day had me seriously concerned about the battery lasting though, but apparently the watch was just doing a lot of downloading and setting up in the background which was decreasing the battery by at least 20% per hour which I thought seemed nuts.  After changing some settings and getting things set up efficiently plus the set up process finalizing, everything is perfect.  Under normal circumstances it's been on for over an hour now with a few text alerts coming through etc. and battery is still 100%.  At this rate it should last a solid amount of time.  The apps on this are really cool.  The health stuff like heart monitoring and blood oxygen levels are awesome to have.  The workout apps are set up pretty nice as well.  It would be nice if there were a better way to do updates and whatnot though than doing it via your iphones bluetooth.  Like youtube reviews etc. mention it's sooooo slow.  I thought something was wrong with the watch at first.  Set up and downloading watchOS 10 take a solid 3-4 hours.  The install is beyond slow doing it via bluetooth.  Going through this thing with a fine tooth comb and getting every single app optimized for battery efficiency etc. took a good 12 plus hours and a ton of youtube videos all mentioning different little tips and tricks.  Lots of troubleshooting occurred too.  The complications on the watches face screen weren't functioning right which required to reset the location and privacy data in the phone plus a couple other steps.  The watch was doing a lot of weird stuff that was destroying it's battery and wasting storage at rapid speeds.  That's all just apple, nothing to do with it being renewed or the seller etc.  They all run the same software in them regardless.  Just being real about it, the set up process of this watch wasn't pleasant and kinda made me disappointed in the purchase initially but once I got that out of the way it's working incredibly well.  Also this being a cellular version, you need to contact your carrier in advance and register this with them via the IMEI number from the phone's about section.  You'll just get errors when trying to set up cellular prior to that.  All in all though, the watch is great,  and I love the design, especially how easy it is to switch out straps of whatever style or color you want.  Those are much cheaper than I expected them to be as well so I immediately grabbed a handful of different options.  Definitely recommend anyone interested in an apple watch to try this.  It shows up in brand new condition, these only came out less than a year ago so even original parts are still very lightly used with a long life ahead of them.  Even with a few frustrations, it gets two thumbs up from me.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 8,"Good product for the price! Charged right up when we got the watch, charges like normal. The quality of the watch is definitely like new and paired directly to my wife’s phone with no hesitation. Apple health and all the features work like heart monitoring and o2 sensors, we bought a cover for it and it never gets scratched no matter how much we beat it/ everyday usage.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 8,"It feels like this specific model is the best one to buy.Not as expensive as the new ones; not old like the older ones. Perfect size. High quality. Works very well with iPhone 14 Pro Max. The Workout, Wallet and Heart rate apps are amazing.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 8,"I purchased this Apple Watch refurbished with an “Excellent” quality rating. When it arrived it has some white scratches along the aluminum casing. The screen also had some light scratches but was mostly not noticeable unless you really looked. Not a big deal I decided to look past those issues, even though I paid for an “Excellent” quality refurbished device.Upon turning the watch on I notice it glitched out a lot when I touched the screen. I figured it was cause I wasn’t wearing it and was at a weird angle so my touches weren’t registering right.I let it charge as it was on 3% out of the box and it took 4 hours to charge to 50%. It came with the old generation charger (USB not USB-C)  as well without a box if you’re curious.When it finally charged I put it on and set it up. I immediately noticed the screen was not responsive and when it was it was incredibly glitchy. It would tap characters multiple times or just not respond at all. This is consistent every time I go to use the watch.I reached out to Amazon who referred me to the seller to see if they could offer a replacement. They did not. They refused to assist me guiding me to return the device through Amazon and get my money back.After coordinating with Amazon they agreed a return is the best solution and offered me a promo credit on my next purchase for the inconvenience and the sellers inability to resolve the problem.I also activated this device within my phone plan prior to confirming it was fully functional, but this is not anyone’s fault but my own. I’ll call that a personal loss. Just some advice to anyone purchasing an Apple Watch with intentions to activate it within their plan, test drive the watch a bit first. I’m now out $50 and have a useless line on my phone plan that I cannot use until I purchase a new Apple Watch from a different seller.",1.0
Apple Watch Series 8,So far I opened the box and noticed the watch actually is not in EXCELLENT condition. It does have a few scratches all over the case. It’s on the charger now because it was completely dead. Like my other watch I had it would automatically start to charge this one is not even turning on. I am gonna wait a few to try and stun it on again. If not I’ll just return the item. I mean the watch is nice but the conditions are not EXCELLENT.,4.0
Apple Watch Series 8,Excellent quality for refurbished! I only buy refurbished tech and amazon has done great with my last 2 watches and even a phone once! Buy refurbished you won’t regret it!,5.0
Apple Watch Series 8,"I like this product a lot. I bought it after it was refurbished, but it was amazon refurbished. there was no scratches on the screen, just around the body, like they said. It looked good, and the color of it was nice. I think it is very useful, especially for the price of it. I was surprised it was so cheap. On my home screen, i keep on heart rate monitor, and i’ll usually look at it. i think it’s pretty accurate since if im sitting down, it’ll be a lot slower then when im up and running around. I would say the heart rate monitoring is good. Finally, it charges pretty quickly. One thing that i was upset about personally was that it only had 82% battery health. However, i was only guaranteed that the health would be 80% or higher. I expected it to be more, but i got what i paid for. Finally, i’ve been using the sleep monitoring for it to see how much i sleep, and it’s been really nice. So many cool features. Definitely recommend!",5.0

Apple Watch Series 8,"If you still have an older iPhone like I do, an 8 Plus which will only run iOS 16, you may not get a series 8 that will work. As far as I have been able to figure out, Apple Watch Series 8 can run watchOS 8, 9, or 10. WatchOS 8 and 9 will work with iPhone iOS 16, but watchOS 10 need iOS 17 or later.There is no way to check the watchOS on an unpaired watch, but the box it came in had a serial number; I called Apple support and they checked the serial number - the watch series 8 I received is running watchOS 10, and there is no way to wipe the watch and downgrade it to watchOS 9.I now need to decide if I return the watch, or finally buy a new phone (this old 8 still works fine so I an hesitant).",1.0
Apple Watch Series 8,"This came in the mail fairly quickly. I really like it. This was my first time having an apple watch. There were no scratches or dings upon arrival. It looks and works like a brand new watch. I had no issues pairing it to my iPhone. I mainly use it so I don't have to carry my phone around with me everywhere I go. I also like it for health tracking. You might want to know that you have to be at least 300 feet or less away from it in order to receive calls and texts. I took it to the water park and the water lock works wonderfully. No issues with that.  Overall, I'd say its a really great product. At the time of typing this, the series 9 is the newest watch. Having seen the 9 and comparing it to this one, there's really not that much difference at all. Definitely worth getting this slightly earlier refurbished 8 that works awesome over spending extra on a brand new 9 or ultra",5.0

Apple Watch Se,"We wanted a watch not a phone. This provides what he needs (ability to message and call and be located) but has the ability to do more later.We can set school time hours for the school year so messages don’t get through - except from parents, but can easily make adjustments to that for things like field day or early release. Downtime hours are set for evening as well. It isn’t an internet browser (yay) but does send and receive gifs. This watch does not have all of the health metrics a # series does but he doesn’t need that. It does steps and heart and workouts etc. it doesn’t track blood O2 or arrhythmias which is fine.As much as I think apple is pretty intuitive as a company for set up- that is less so when setting up a family watch. I googled a lot of things. Including how to get parent messages to break through school time. Not intuitive. And it can’t play music if not linked to its own phone. Oh well.Overall works great for a middle schooler. Helps us hold off on a phone longer than purchasing a different brand kid watch.We’ve had it for 3-4 months. It does need daily charging.",5.0

Watch came without issue, still under warranty until next winter so I'm thinking this is someone's quick holiday buyer's remorse return. 100% battery, no activation issues and signed up for cellular service without a hitch.Strap looks OEM, charging puck didn't show up on my Mac but since the SE 2 doesn't have fast charge, it doesn't really matter if the charging puck is OEM or third-party. I had to buy USB-C spares but if you don't need that, the included works fine. Charges to full in about 2 hours as per Apple.Pretty much half the price of a cellular model in new retail box. No fancy box but you decide if that's worth anything.",5.0
Apple Watch Se,"I searched for a while to find a watch that wouldn’t break my bank. I only needed this because FedEx doesn’t allow cell phones in their warehouse.

I don’t know why other people put bad reviews, but it’s worth the money. I also work on farms and it’s so far with standing the test of getting beat up.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 9,"So this watch is everything you would think it would be. I have nothing negative to say honestly. The unboxing experience is just as you would hope and expect from and apple product. The watch itself is just absolutely beautiful. The softwear ie ios is just unmatched in my opinon. The screen is bright and functions as good as a flagship item should. It charges very very fast and the battery last over a day as long as you dont have the always on display active. If you have an apple product then the ease of use is just that, easy to use. Even if its your first apple watch you would be able to get around after a few minutes of tinkering around. All in all it is the best watch for brand, quality, design, features ect. I love apple watches and im not only saying that because i use apple and have for years. I tend to give other products a once over just to see how they stand in comparison and yes there are others out there that might be cheaper and do most of the same functions but you get what you pay for as with anything in the world and apple is in my opinion top notch technology in todays ever expanding market.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 9,Straight from Apple Store. The functionality of the watch is user friendly. Watch quality is impeccable being from Apple. The charger is fast and it lasts about 2 days with “always on” display running. The value for the money is worth it being an MA and constantly checking the time. The brightness is adjustable and adaptable. I will forever be an Apple Watch girl.,5.0

Apple Watch Series 9,"In my experience, Apple never fails to deliver a quality product. This is my first ever Apple Watch. I got the series , 9, 41 mm. I bought a new one instead of refurbished because I wanted to have all of the guarantees of a new watch. Amazon offered some great options and prices and I ended up getting mine for about $50 less than if I had bought it from the Apple Store. I called Apple and asked them about buying an Apple Watch from Amazon and they said they support all of the retailers who sell their products, but could not guarantee it if it was refurbished so that was why I decided to go ahead and buy brand new. I’m still learning a lot of the details of the watch, but it is so nice. It mimics my phone perfectly plus add some fun Clock faces and additional features for working out and health benefits. I love the functions and the size is just right. You have options to make it very bright or keep it dim. So far I just charge it in the evening. I haven’t had any problem with it losing its charge last night when I charged it. It still has 67%.I’ve always worn a Fitbit and they offer good products as well, but the iPhone just does so much more! I love it!!",5.0
Apple Watch Series 10,"Watch is not a big upgrade from a series 7. I had a 45mm series 7, and bought a 42mm series 10. I did this bc the 46mm as the bigger size was massive. I always put a case on my watches and it feels the same as the 45mm did. Screen size is so close I can’t tell a difference. I upgraded to have the sleep apnea detection as I was concerned I was dealing with that. I also went from a GPS only to a cellular model. Just hooked it up so I can’t say how that works. Anyway, I like that it’s thinner-tho with a case, again, you can’t really tell. Nothing to write home about, but good quality as expected from Apple. I bought refurbished, excellent condition and it was new in my opinion. Band, charger original Apple products . Zero flaws, 100% battery health, not a scratch or blemish. I’ve changed the band and put the case on already. Pics are for size reference of 42mm with starlight case. I couldn’t find pics of the watch with a case on it, online, and I wanted to see it. My wrist size is 170mm.",5.0

Apple Watch Series 8,"Quick Review:Is the watch south of $300? If yes, add it to the cart. Do you hate it? Return it.Justify Your Purchase:1. Do you have your phone around for the most part?2. Do you usually drive places on your own?3. Is this purchase more for structure vs. leisure/fitness?4. Will you be around a polluted or dusty environment?5. Are you experiencing stress, insomnia, or health complications?6. For woman: Do you care about menstrual, ovulation, and symptom tracking while on your cycle?*If yes to 3 questions with no interest in upgrading soon, purchase.==== Review: Overall 4.5/5 =====I hesitated to buy the watch because it was labeled ""renewed."" Ironically enough, the product did me one better by not turning on. I struggled to contact the Seller because of Amazon and not the business. The watch did not work for the first 2-3 weeks because of the charger, but it's perfect now.Trust me when I say the mic quality is impressive. I'm not flashy, but I believe this purchase is worth it just with the mic ALONE. You'll see me eating ramen for the next month to rock this! The watch makes me feel energized and productive.I find myself using the watch more than my phone. There's not one connection issue or call drop like there is on my actual phone. The box looked a little dinked, yet authentic. I assume the previous owner didn't keep the box in shape. No scratches, the product includes a soft band, and the customer service is prompt and understanding.I can only choose 4 or 5, so I decided on 5 because of the merchandiser.==== End Review: Overall 4.5/5 =====Series 7 v 8:The Series 8 has Bluetooth 5.3, and the Series 7 has Bluetooth 5.0.The 8 has temperature sensors that separate your data from outside factors like weather. If you don't care about Dust protection, Crash detection, Ovulation predictions, or System trackers, go for the Series 7 for all the same features for ~10.Pricing:If you want to save cash, go for the Series 6 to save ~$100. It has all the same features as the Series 7. Its only differences are the 1mm screen and a slightly slower chip that won't be noticeable for another 2-3 years. You will also have the option to add a cellular data plan for $10/month to purchase before prices are closer to the initial 7 or 8 models.Cellular Data Plan v Raw Dawg:The data plan is if you are typically 100m away from your phone. For all my struggle babies, 100m is a little more than half a football field or ~4 times the size of a basketball court. Do people run without their phones? Cellular data is ideal for hiking, amusement/water parks, and running because you can leave your phone locked away.",5.0

Apple Watch Series 8,"I recently picked up a renewed Apple Watch Series 8 from Amazon, and while it was a bit iffy at first, it’s been working great overall. When I first got it, the initializing process took a bit longer than expected, which might have made it feel a little off. The screen did have some signs of wear, with light scratches visible, but since I use it at work every day, it’s picked up a few more. It’s not a huge issue though, as it still functions perfectly.In terms of durability, this watch holds up well. Despite the light scratches on the screen, it’s proven to be pretty sturdy over time. I’ve worn it every day, and it’s taken a few bumps without any major damage. The build quality is solid, and even with the wear and tear from daily use, it still feels like a premium product.The charging ability is solid too. It charges up fairly quickly, and I’ve never had issues with it not charging properly. As for the battery, it started at 97% health when I received it, and it’s dropped to 93% now. Even with the slight decline, the battery still lasts me through a full day of work, so I haven’t had to worry about it running out.The fitness tracker works great. It accurately tracks my workouts, heart rate, and daily activity, and I really appreciate the health metrics it provides. The Always-On Retina display is bright and clear, so I can easily check my stats or notifications during the day. The sound quality for calls and media is decent too. The speaker is loud enough for calls, and I can easily hear notifications or music when I need to.For a renewed model, the Apple Watch Series 8 has been a solid purchase. If you’re okay with a few signs of wear and the minor drop in battery health, it’s a great deal for the price. It performs really well for daily use and holds up nicely over time.",4.0

Apple Watch Series 7,I've been purchasing Apple *Refurbished from the actual Apple refurbished website since the iMac. Never had a problem but this is the first time I took a chance on a secondary retailer and was a slight bit apprehensive. Apple site purged all their 7s when the 8 came out and this is the better series over the two so I took the plunge with Woot. This Apple Watch Series 7 *Renewed Excellent Condition came to me in Mint condition. Not a single scratch and works perfectly. Battery health 96% tells me that if this was 'pre-owned' the owner only wore it on occasion and took care of it very very well. Could've also been an open box item that couldn't be sold as new so there's that too. Excellent deal here.,5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,I just received my watch and the overall battery life percentage is 71%?!?! Huh bro the thing is in functional. I’ll be lucky if it gets through half the day. Complete bull crap. I say some reviews where people showed like 89-95% and said dang that’s not too bad I’ll get one. But like 70%?! That’s a whole 10% under what apple recommends before battery replacement. This should have received a new battery before being sold again. The watch came completely dead. I’ve had it on the charger for an hour and it’s at 11%.,1.0

Apple Watch Series 6,"Update:  07/06/22Returned the watch.  The microphone intermittently functioned, the scratches were bothering me, and new watches are only $100 more than this beat up thing.  Yes, $100 isn’t cheap, but overall it was worth the extra cost.  My new Apple Watch 7 has a larger screen and no signs of use.  It’s worth the upgrade, especially when Amazon describes the refurbished watch “like new” when that is clearly not the case.  Calls from the refurbished watch only worked half the time, and the speaker sounded muffled.  Just pony up for a new watch, which are discounted right now for an apple 7, and be happy.  Hope this updates helps you decide.Ok, the watch costs less than new, but that’s about where the good stuff ends.  It did include a usb charger (Samsung brand! 😟) generic charging cable, off-brand white strap, and poorly packaged in a generic white box.  Literally nothing was done to “recondition” the watch.  First thing I had to do was clean off the former user’s grime that coated the watch back (yuck!).  This took some soap, water, and a toothbrush to clean out the little crevices.  Screen and case came with minor scratches overall, with one more annoying, more pronounced screen scratch that really bugs me.  Battery was completely depleted, which is not good for lithium batteries.  C’mon, for the money you could at least clean and charge the thing!  It’s not in terrible shape, but very clearly used.  It certainly was not refurbished in any way that I can tell.  Imagine buying the watch from your mom after she wore it for a year and you get the idea about my watch’s condition.  Not abused, but certainly used.I’m torn.  This was not a great purchase, and I’m left wondering if its worth the $150 less than new price.  Hard to say.  Just don’t believe the product description claiming “appears new” because that is far from the truth.  Set your expectations accordingly if you purchase from the “Camera Guyz”.  They just take the watch, toss it in a nondescript box with whatever knockoff bits they have laying around, and mail it to you.  Look, you’re still paying a lot of money, so there’s no reason not to expect a quality product.  Amazon says I have a 90 day warranty, so there’s time (accidental pun) to evaluate it further.  Yes it works.  Yes, I will eventually add more wear and tear to the watch when wearing.  Yes, the “appears new” description is complete fiction.  Overall value is debatable.  One star for inaccurate condition description and an annoying screen scratch.",1.0

Really, the only thing that would’ve made it perfect would have  been if the battery had 100% capacity. This one was at 84%. I contacted the seller and they pointed out that in their listing. It specifically states that renewed watches are guaranteed to have a charge greater than 80% which this one did. They also offered me a complete refund if I was not satisfied. I ended up keeping it and I’m very happy that I did. It works flawlessly. No regrets here.",5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,A great watch. I have been using it for a while. It came scratch free and the battery last for 2 days. It’s got a nice band but I upgraded that. It charges quickly,5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,I was very surprised how great condition the watch is in because it was bought used. But honestly works great. I don’t like how it has to be charged every night but so does my phone so it’s okay but the battery life is better than my phone. It was definitely easy to set up. I will say get a protection case for it as I am constantly hitting it on things because I don’t know how durable it is.,5.0
Apple Watch Series 7,"Upon unboxing the watch the packaging was ok and packed properly to avoid transit damage. Despite the minimal scratches around the case and screen I thought this was not really acceptable due to the product was specified as “excellent” condition but it is refurbished so I figured oh well, all good right, I’ll deal with it.I’ve had the watch now for 3 1/2 months, grab it off the charger this AM and noticed when I was unlocking it I heard no audio from the speakers. Normal trouble shooting processes were completed, I.e. power cycle, unpair and re pair the watch, checked the volume was turned up, and made sure it wasn’t on silent mode which none of these revitalized my Apple Watch’s speaker. I went about my day as normal, completing several more power cycles and power cycled my phone in hopes that this situation would “self heal”, no such luck.So now, I’m stuck with a certified refurbished in excellent condition Apple Watch with a speaker that isn’t speaking. An added kicker is that I am 26 days past my return window on this product and it decided to fail. Unfortunate!",1.0

Apple Watch Series 7,"I ordered this blue watch that was through the ""Acceptable"" watch order option.

This was not listed as a possibility of occurring as normal in the listing. Also, the 3rd party charger overheats when attempting to charge the watch.I had no problem with the battery health being 85% or all the scratches on the aluminum housing.

By May 2025 the watch shut off and could not be turned back on. Took it to a repair shop and was told it is the mother board and cannot be fixed.

Apple Watch Se,"So I bought this just to try out an Apple Watch as I wasn’t sure if it was actually going to be useful for my day to day life . Needless to say I LOVE it. It came in great condition, battery life is great. I had no issues setting up with my mobile carrier (Verizon for reference)  I honestly don’t feel the need to “upgrade” and purchase the newer Apple Watches, which was my original plan as this was supposed to be “test run” with out spending an arm and leg. My only complaint is that the charger I was sent was faulty and wouldn’t charge the watch. Fortunately, I had already ordered another one so it wasn’t a big deal for me but would be frustrating for someone who hadn’t done that. The only other complaint I have is that the watch band that came with it is far too large for my tiny wrists. This is obviously not through any fault of either Apple or this seller but if you have little wrists, you might consider purchasing an additional band with the watch. Setting that aside - I am personally very happy with my purchase .",4.0

Apple Watch Se,"I wanted to swim with my watch, plus to have all the other monitoring features provided by an Apple watch, but I did NOT want to pay what is, to me, a ridiculous price for one. I opted for a refurbished product and am extremely pleased. It looks and behaves like a brand new watch. I put off writing a review until I'd had it for long enough to feel it would have shown me any faults other buyers might want to know. I haven't found any.I have several different bands. The mesh ones (as other reviews will tell you) tend to get tiny breaks in the links that catch on things, but the bands are inexpensive, so economically replaceable. All the watch faces are fun to try out and change your mind about. The watch interfaces nicely with your phone, so you don't have to try to read tiny little type on your watch (though you can, if you wish). You will find that if you want to answer calls via your watch you'll have to pay your phone provider for the privilege, but you don't have to do that, so can dispense with that cost.All in all, I'm very happy with my refurbished Apple watach",5.0
Apple Watch Se,"Functionality:The watch arrived set to another account and iPhone.I'm not an Apple guru, wizard, genius (right) or whatever the hell affectation they assign to themselves. There is no setup instructions in the box I received. I could not get the watch to go through the setup routine where it could pair to my iPhone's bluetooth and from there access my Apple account. I was prepared to return it but then thought, maybe when they refurbed this (whatever that entails) they didn't reset to the watch to factory settings.I went to the area on the watch where I could erase all data and bring it back to factory settings. That solved the problem.So, if you are looking at your refurbed watch and it isn't walking you through the new phone setup steps. Do a total erase of all data and nonfactory apps and start fresh.

Apple Watch Series Se 44Mm,"I dropped my Apple Watch about 6 months after getting it July 2023 for my bday but still wore it.  I forgot it was cracked and was giving my g-baby a bath and it ruined it the rest of the way🥲I really wanted a rose gold one again, I had one 2 watches ago!

Apple Watch Series 9,"i purchased a refurbished 41mm stainless steel series 9 apple watch from Russ Enterprises. I was very happy with the quality of the product once it arrived. the watch's battery health is at 100%, there are no scratches on the screen, and there are a minimal amount of scuffs along the top and bottom sides of the watch itself that I don't notice. i've been wearing the watch for about two weeks and i haven't noticed any problems. if I didn't know this was refurbished, i would think it was brand new.I had initially bought this same product directly from amazon for a slightly cheaper price, but the watch i received was highly scratched and scuffed. i returned that one, bought the same product from Russ Enterprises, and was much more satisfied with the quality of their product. I know that i'm relatively lucky and not all refurbished watches will come as pristine as the one I received, but especially after comparing the products from the two sellers, I would definitely recommend buying specifically from Russ Enterprises.",5.0

Apple Watch Se,"I have this watch synced with the following :TessieGoogle assistantGovee home productsMonster lighting productsGoogle nest camerasBlink camerasWatch cam appIt is absolutely seamless. I can say “hey siri, open rear trunk with Tessie “ if my hands are full with dogs/groceries.I can say “hey siri, pull up doorbell camera” using the “watch cam” app for 3$I can use google assistant to control my Govee devices by saying “hey siri, hey Google turn on bedroom lights to blue”It is an extra 2 words but not that bad ;)“Hey siri, turn on bedroom heater”I bought this mainly to be able to use my tesla (climate, frunk and trunk) without even pulling my phone out.

Apple Watch Se,"I've had several fitness and smartwatches over the years, but the Apple Watch SE truly stands out. This watch is incredibly accurate in tracking active calories burned, which has been essential for maintaining my calorie deficit eating plan. The heart rate monitoring, especially during my morning cardio workouts, is spot on. The look and fit of the band are excellent, although there's a bit of a learning curve to fastening it securely, but once it's on, it stays put.One minor drawback is the battery life; it does tend to be quite power-hungry. After watching a few YouTube videos and tweaking some settings, I managed to conserve battery life more effectively. However, you'll still need to charge it daily for about an hour. Despite this, the features and accuracy of the Apple Watch SE make it a worthy investment, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable fitness partner and stylish accessory.",5.0
Apple Watch Se,"For years I put off getting an Apple watch because I didn't think it would compare to my Garmin watches or be as tough as my G-Shocks.  While some of that is true this is still an item that I found to be worth the purchase.  It is my go to watch at the office because it helps me keep up with meetings, texts, phone calls and what my kids are up to (i.e. location services).  Because of the Apple watch I also find that I am not constantly grabbing my phone as most things I can simply turn my wrist to see and respond to.  The only reason it was not a 5 star for me is you pretty much have to charge it each night.  Not a deal breaker for me as I am not looking to sleep in it anyway but better battery life would be nice.  Really easy to use and there are lots of channels like ""Watch Jumble"" on YT that provide easy step by step directions to get you started.  Well worth it, I wish I would have bought one earlier.",4.0

Apple Watch Series 8,"I bought this watch for my 19-year-old daughter for the medical aspects of this watch and also the crash detection. We always worry about our teens and young adults nowadays and this brings me a little peace of mind. She also has a medical condition.I like that it doesn’t need to be charged every 12 hours like my Series 5 model.  The battery was still at 70 percent by the time I went to bed.Compared to the Fitbit, that thing doesn’t need to be charged but every six days. It’s amazing. However, I noticed that the Versa 4 was causing me to lose calls when I would use my earbuds. I’m often times hands-free and when I go to answer with my earbud it would hang up on them instead.I don’t have that happen on this watch. Maybe it’s something Apple did intentionally so that we only use their products? lolI’m not a fan of the band they sent me with the watch but it works and I can always change it for her.I did end up buying Amazon’s insurance which I recommend especially when buying refurbished or renewed as they like to call it.So far I’m really happy with what we got.",5.0

Fitbit Versa 4,"My orginal review was correct but after getting things set up the way that I want, it is a great actvity tracker.1. Battery Life is amazing! If you are like me you hate when you are working out and the watch dies not recoding the steps or activities. This watch will last for 7 days2. The app is easy to use- If you are serious about measuring your activity great way to see how you are doing for the last several days, weeks, months...3. It measures what I care about steps and activityThe watch is not for you if you want-1. seeing emails and texts (not a strong feature)2. Trying to use it to answer callsI change my three stars to five stars after using it for awhile. The band and the orginal watch setup was not well designed but you can order a band for $10 and change the watch screen (use google to search how to do it, it is not hard but not obvious).The amazing battery life was what pushed it to 5 stars.Orginal Review-I had a Versa 2 and really liked it. I have very basic usages-steps, activity and as a watch. It did a wonderful job. It died and so I bought the Versa 4. 1. the watch ban is cheap!! the versa 2 was nothing great but this one is awful. (so i will have to buy another one to replace the one that comes with it). 2. the new watch face trys to do too much. KISS should have been there moto Keep it simple stupid. 3 the sync with the app seems to be off. I just got it so it just might take more time to get use to it.Im sure in the end it will be ok and do it's job. That is why 3 stars.",5.0
Fitbit Versa 4,Purchased May 2. It is now June 24 and I cannot get the fitbit versa 4 to charge. The magnetic charging  square connects and I have tried changing charging bricks. It is completely dead so I can't do a factory reset as Google suggested.  So thumbs down for me. My Versa 2 lasted 4 years!,5.0
Fitbit Versa 4,"When I first got this, it would not maintain sync.  I updated the firmware on the watch, tried doing a factory reset twice, uninstalled/reinstalled the fitbit app twice, ensured that the app wasn't allowed to go to sleep when in the background... nothing worked.  It would work for a few minutes, then when I tried to command Alexa, it would say connection lost.  I decided to contact support, and they informed me that my app was outdated.  Come to find out, version 4.04 of the bitbit app is too old, and will not work.  The latest version, 4.06.7 had not been released for my phone yet, as is typical ridiculous play store behavior.  Google... are you listening?  When a developer releases an update, you shall IMMEDIATELY make it available to EVERY device!  I manually downloaded the apk and installed it, and everything has been working great since.  Alexa follows my direct orders immediately, phone calls come through, texts come through, and I can sync with ease.Overall, I suppose this is an improvement over the Versa 2.  Screen is a little bigger, but the notification vibrations don't seem to be as forceful, even when set to strong.This uses google wallet instead of google pay as the Versa 2 did, so my AmEx will not work for contactless payment.Phone call feature is nice, seems to work OK.  I can hear them, they can hear me.  You can only answer calls, you can't make them.  The $50 brand x watch I ordered to replace this one before I got the sync figured out was able to do that.  It could also control my camera and music player, neither of which is possible on the Versa 4.Google maps is nice if you walk in unfamiliar areas.  I'll probably never need it, but it's nice.Battery life seems to be improved over the Versa 2, but mine was 2 years old so I'm sure the battery had gradually decreased it's charge capacity.  I used it for several days, and he battery was still at 55%.Skin temperature sensor will one day be nice when it can sync with a smart thermostat and automatically adjust the temperature as needed.  But for now, it's just a novelty and has no purpose.  Yes, I know my skin is hot.  I woke up in a puddle of sweat.  Yup, I'm freezing, so my skin is cold.o2 saturation is nice if you have any relevant health problems.If you want to take full advantage of the watch, get the free ""Overview"" clock face by Chris Blyth.  It gives you current and average heart rate, battery percentage, fully customizable date format, allows for a larger clock that shows seconds, and you can have weather, and 6 other health stats displayed on the main screen, all at once.  I have steps, distance, calories burned, active zone minutes, floors, and BMI/BMR.  It all fits, and is easy to read.  Vast improvement over the default face, which shows no useful information.  I had th is face on my versa 2, and loved it.  So glad it's available for the 4.Bottom line, it's a good watch.  There are cheaper brand x ones out there, but none of them have NFC payment, and not all of them have Alexa.  And, you get what you pay for.  fit & finish feels cheap, the screens get washed out in the sun, finicky alexa integration and so on.  Best to pony up and get a refined product.  Be sure to update your fitbit app.  Their customer support said the latest version should be released within a week, but I circumvented the beurocracy and downloaded it manually.  Why wait?",5.0
Fitbit Charge 6,"I use to have the fitbit 3 se and loved it for 3 years and i tried the samsung 4 for all the bells and whistles but the charge lasted a day which to me is counterproductive. I decided to go back to my fitbit since I also enjoyed the platform more for recording all my data such as food ect. I missed the barcode feature when putting in your meals. I use mine more strictly for steps, 24 heart rate, sleep analysis, contactless payments and tracking all my workouts. I'm not a runner anymore so I haven't used the built in GPS but based on technical reviews I didn't miss out. It's a fairly new concept which needs more software updates to be fully functional and not drain the battery life to oblivion. My fitbit actually lasts me a little over 8 days this is with turning the always on display off, txt message notifications off ( I don't see a need for this since I'm not one to utilize too many short message replies). And having the display brightness set to dim and even in full sun I can still see the display very crisply. The contactless payments uses Google pay which if you are already an android user with a Google pay wallet set up was easy and I like that for security reasons it only is set for 24 hour use after putting in your 4 digit code before having to reinput your code. Now the code input is trivial to me I don't like the setup for it. The water resistance is good I haven't showered with the device but the waterlock works well when I wash my hands multiple times a day being a nurse. I have not tested it swimming for the 50 meter water resistance claim. The workout options have improved with more options and now I'm able keep track of my active zone minutes. The heart rate tracking during exercises is said to be more accurate than the charge 5 based on tech data analysis reviews that I researched before hand. The downside is Spotify was removed and replaces with YouTube music in which you will need a subscription for. The 1.4 inch amoled size is perfect if you aren't a huge fan of having a bulky tracker on your wrist. You also now have the option of syncing your device with other heart rate monitoring equipment/workout machines including peloton but for me isn't useful. It has a haptic side button now that was seen in older models which i prefer. Another great feature is the addition of Google maps for those are are runners but again you may compromise the battery life. Since Google bought fitbit there will be more Google geared software. For more health features you now have the eda and ecd scan no BP monitor like on my samsung 4 to my knowledge has pased fda as of yet. You also have a skin temperature sensor like in the fitbit sense how accurate I'm unsure it would need to be tested against something like a NTC thermistor. The sleep analysis data seems overall accurate. I also do use a cpap machine. Overall for the price I think it's a more than suitable tracking device with its more updated hr monitoring compared to other apple watches, garmins and huawei. Still room for improvement such as the built in GPS. I think the GPS should just be mirrored on your phone which is still an option on the charge 6 you can chose dynamic, built in or phone. I would stick with phone to preserve battery but in all I recommend this product.",5.0
Fitbit Charge 6,"I had my old FitBit Charge 4 for 5 years. The band broke off at year 2, so I would put it in a pocket or in a sock while I went about my day....worked great, just easy to lose that way. We were on vacation and it just died. I had really gotten used to having a FitBit to track steps (really all I do). Amazon had the Charge 6 for a good price, and it was almost seamless to set this up. I love the ability to change the clock face. It does track sleep but I'm not sure it's accurate. No matter. It tracks my steps, reminds me to move when I am sitting, notifies me if my phone is ringing when my ringer is off, and (bonus) I can see what time it is on my wrist. Glad I bought this one",5.0
Fitbit Charge 6,"Bought January 2024. So, I have had an Apple Watch since 2017. I LOVED it. But I didn’t love the battery time. The things I was interested in, like sleep tracking, I couldn’t do because it needed to charge or I couldn’t use it the next day. My mom has a Fitbit and for years was telling me to get one. After some health issues, I needed to start being more cognizant of my health. I didn’t want to spend another $5-600 on an Apple Watch that at most gets 2 days of battery now. I was interested in the Oura ring, but I have 60 lbs. to lose and those can’t be sized as you lose weight. So I researched and found the Fitbit Charge 6 was my best choice.Mostly pro’s.It is really comfortable. When I fell asleep accidentally with the Apple Watch my wrist was sore after. So far, I’m getting 6-7 days of charge out of it, which is a game changer. I now don’t miss days of tracking because I forgot to charge it.I feel like the screen size is appropriate and it’s well made. I’m not sure about the accuracy, but reviews I’ve watched where people test them they seem close enough. And that’s good enough for me, I want a baseline.You can adjust the haptics for notifications, I have it on the hardest vibration and it’s awesome. It’s easy to read the screen, just 2 taps. It says you can water lock it for swimming/shower but I haven’t utilized that yet.The app… okay so when I purchased this (January 2024) they offered the premium app for 6 months free, then $80 a year. I will be keeping the premium. It still can be used without, but I want ALL the metrics you can get as well as meditations and workouts. It has replaced MyFitnessPal because I can track everything in this app. It also links with my Bluetooth scale. You can track steps, miles, calories, exercise, activity minutes (150 minutes a week as recommended), standing activity by getting up every hour for 250 steps, (it reminds you). SpO2, HRV, skin temp., HR, sleep (including stages). I’m sure I’m forgetting something. I haven’t used the GPS function which I heard drains the battery significantly.Somewhat cons, or things I would appreciate it having. This device is logged in through Google. I do see messages and notifications from my iPhone 13, but are unable to respond which is fine. You can control YouTube music, but not your Apple Music. It’s Just an adjustment from my Apple Watch. I’m also not able to sync it with Apple Maps because I hate Google maps. And I haven’t figured out how to use that between my phone and the Fitbit yet even after watching tutorials. I wish they had more watch faces to choose from, I think there was about 12?. I just felt like the one I picked was as close to what I wanted, but it wasn’t. The time takes up a large portion of the screen which I feel like is unnecessary. What I feel the app is lacking is something to track when you’ve taken your meds. If they did, this app would literally be a one stop shop for my health/fitness tracking. Note: a comment someone made about med tracking was just set an alarm. The problem is that if you are someone like me that is never at the same place everyday, you could turn the alarm off and then forget later whether or not you took them. It’s a really quick fix they could do.I HIGHLY recommend the Charge 6, I wish I had listened to my mom and got it a while ago. The few things I gave up by switching from my Apple Watch is minor. I’m not missing them other than Apple Maps and Music.",5.0
Fitbit Inspire 3,"I had the previous version of this, I think it was the alta. I loved the alta and was so sad that it stopped. I got this inspire to replace the alta. So far it is working amazing and has a good battery life. I was so scared i would have to charge it all the time. In the three weeks i've had it i've only had to charge it a handful of times and it charges really fast. I like that i can track my steps, see my messages. I loved the feature where if you don't know where your phone is you can press a button on the fitbit and your phone makes a sound.",5.0
Fitbit Inspire 3,"Initially, I purchased this watch to help me track my heart rate zones while swimming. Truthfully, that didn’t really work out exactly according to plan. Yes, it is waterproof for swimming. Yes, it does track laps and show you zone minutes IN THE APP after your swim is complete. I was looking for something I could monitor during swim to make sure my heart rate was in zone 3 for fat burning. So, this didn’t do exactly what I hoped. HOWEVER, the watch has been absolutely fantastic and does far more than I expected it to. The battery life is amazing, the accuracy is great, no issues with connectivity ever. I wear it 24/7 and it has helped me really understand my health. I log my water intake, I connected it to MyfitnessPal for tracking macros/calories, and it has seriously helped me understand my activity level and sleeping patterns. 10/10 recommend if you’re looking for a fitness watch, worth every penny.",5.0
Fitbit Inspire 3,"I have had this watch for about 2 months and would highly recommend. If you’re looking for a fitness watch for simple tracking, this is the one for you. The quality is great, comfortable and not bulky in the wrist, and looks great!I charge once every 10 days or so. Great battery life!Compatible with Strava. Accurately tracks workouts and detects workouts without starting a workout.Only reason it doesn’t get 5 stars is because recovery tracking can be hard to measure.",4.0
Fitbit Inspire 3,"I’ve previously had a Charge 4 and then a 5.  Like them both, but all good things come to an end.  Typical life span a little over 2 years.  I’m ok with that.  What I really like about this tracker is the smaller size.  When my Charge 5 died (tried to wash it off under the faucet), I looked into the Charge 6.  Reviews were not reassuring.  So this one had more positive reviews and thought I’d give it shot.  So far it’s been great.  Easy to use, display responds well to touch, screen is legible, and it supports just what I need.  Plus, it’s less $$ than the new Charge.  At this point very happy with my purchase.  Recommended. Will follow up with updates as needed.Update 5-10-24. So within three days battery dropped to 19%.  A disappointment given the description states up to 10 days.  So I made a few changes in the watch configuration and fully recharged.  After36hours battery is at 66%.  A week would be acceptable but anything less a disappointment.Update 5-13-24. Turned off always on display.  Battery at 44% after 6 days, not bad.  Happy I bought this tracker over the Charge 6.Update 6-1-24 Ok, I really like this tracker.  Soooo glad I bought it over the Charge 6.  It has yet to disappoint me and Im getting at least 8-9 days from a charge.  Best part is I like the small profile and simplicity of the display.  I see the large display watches and trackers and wonder why anyone would want such a clunky device on their wrist.  Now if you wants apps, fancy displays, emergency calling, and all parameters on one screen, this tracker is not for you.  So glad I made this purchase.1-25-25. So the original Fitbit functionality was great throughout the past 9 months until the hinge point of the strap failed.  The plastic where the pin secures the strap to the watch fractured.  What to do?  I tried some epoxy, worked for a few weeks.  So I just ordered a new watch.  Unfortunately, the watch gave me less than one year of service.  Had it not been for its otherwise excellent performance I would have considered abandoning Fitbit.  But I went and ordered a new one.  Seems the watch is a disposable item with a life expectancy of less than a year.  Too bad, seems few things in life have consistent longevity.  I’ll have to see how long this one keeps me happy.  I’m not going to deduct a star at this point.  We’ll just have to see how this goes.4-11-25  I really like this device.  it has performed well.  I've been reading a few negative reviews.  Seems people expect too much from a small rather inexpensive fitness watch.  This device is great as a tracker but is not without fault.  Keep that in mind and you won't be disappointed.  I think others feel they should get the equivalent of an expensive electrocardiogram or sleep results that you can only get from visiting a sleep center.  Ain't gonna happen.  Just use the device as it is intended, as a tracker.  Overall, once the tracker has accumulated enough data on your habits, it will serve as a reliable reflection of your exercise and health.  I think it is worth it and would buy another.7-10-25  A few more months of use.  No complaints.  Good tracker.  I sync it up with my iPhone and iPad.  Sometimes it goes ok other times I need to pair it again.  But not a major issue as it does catch up with the latest data.  I rely on this compact tracker quite a bit for my steps, distance walked, exercise time, and general sleep quality.  it also seems stop on with my resting heart rate.  I still like it very much and would buy again.",5.0
Fitbit Inspire 3,"I don’t really write reviews super often but I have to this time.First of all, I’ve had this for about a year, and it does what it says it does. It’s a good counter for steps, it monitors my heart rate, it notifies me when I get a text. It’s nothing special but no complaints. If that was the whole story, I wouldn’t be writing this.Background, I’m exceedingly forgetful. I lose stuff all the time and I’ve lost this bad boy many times but I always find him. I lost him recently but just couldn’t find him. Until this morning. When I found him dangling in the dryer that had been running for 2 hours on high. After going through the washer on heavy the night before.I grabbed him and realized that this time I had really messed up, he was more than lost this time, he was lost to the world. But for you know whats and giggles, I plugged him into the charger.He works. He looks completely normal. Nothing is off.In a time when technology is so fragile, when we are constantly fighting planned obsolescence, this little Fitbit is a reminder that sometimes technology can go above and beyond what is expected. I mean, do you really think an Apple Watch would have survived all that?If you’re looking for a relatively straightforward step counter that’ll track your sleep, your heart rate, a good little watch that connects to your phone, I can’t recommend this enough.",5.0

Fitbit Sense 2,"I’ve had the Fitbit Sense 2 for a couple months now, and I’ve been really impressed with what it offers. I’ve tried a few smartwatches over the years, but this one stands out because it actually helps me stay on top of my health without being overwhelming.What’s working well:Stress tracking: The built-in sensor that tracks stress throughout the day has been more useful than I expected. It lets me know when I’m a bit too tense and reminds me to take a breather.Sleep tracking: Super detailed and pretty accurate. It’s not just telling me how long I slept, it’s breaking it down into stages and helping me figure out why some nights feel more restful than others.Health features: Between heart rate, skin temperature, and blood oxygen tracking, I feel like I’ve got a better grip on how I’m doing overall. It’s not medical-grade, of course, but it’s enough to be helpful.Battery life: I easily get 5–6 days per charge, which is great since I wear it overnight for sleep tracking.Comfort and design: It looks good and wears comfortably. Lightweight and low-profile, which I appreciate.Things to keep in mind:It’s not a full-blown smartwatch with tons of apps or customization options. It’s built for health tracking, and it stays in that lane.You can’t type out full text messages on it, just use quick replies or voice-to-text. That hasn’t been an issue for me, but it’s worth knowing.If you're looking for a smartwatch that focuses on wellness and helps you build better habits, this is a great pick. It doesn’t try to do everything, but what it does, it does really well. I’d recommend it to anyone looking to track their health in a simple, reliable way.",5.0
Fitbit Sense 2,"I purchased this watch primarily for its continuous heart monitoring, ECG app, sleep monitoring, plus some basic fitness like steps and stairs.It was easy to install. I was pleased to be able to turn off the GPS and Alexa which may have been good for an extra day of battery life. I was able to turn off the fitness nags. I've been running and working out over 40 years and don't need nags. I was also able to skip the Premium service since I don't want a monthly bill and don't want other nagging.There are a huge number of watch faces available. I focused only on free watch faces. One thing that wasn't clear is that apparently you can only install 6 faces on the  watch. When I found a better choice, it wouldn't install and had no useful explanation of why not. I ended up looking specifically for watch faces that included a battery indicator (surprisingly not universal!) and basic fitness figures. The hard part was finding watch faces that increased the font size of the battery % and fitness figures so they were more easily legible to older eyes.The biggest problem is with the watch band. I have a narrow wrist and bands with holes like the OEM band are never spaced in a way that fits well. So I ordered a new band that is metal mesh and uses a clamp to fix the length. That works to get a comfortable fit, but is a pain to put on. Good thing I only take the watch off once a day! So I tried another watch band that had a folding clasp, like my old watch band, and is adjusted in length by removing links. The whole process of removing links was a serious pain, requiring a magnifying ring light and great patience. And the link removal did not yield a snug and comfortable fit, just as with the OEM watch band. Back to the band that works, for now.Update. I just discovered it is possible, apparently, to get an adapter from my old watch band that attaches to the watch with pins to the FitBit clamp system. I'm hoping that will allow me to use my old watch band which was excellent.Further update:https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BN1RVM5W?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsThis adapter took a long time to arrive all the way from China, but it worked perfectly. My old watch band was a 20mm band with adjustable sizing clamp and a folding clasp to take it on and off:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08CY5D2LB/ref=pe_2313400_740551120_em_1p_0_lm?th=1Now I have the best of all worlds. A good watch and it is easy to put on and take off with a snug fit. I wonder why no one seems to make this style of watch band specifically to fit the FitBit?",5.0
Fitbit Sense 2,"Amazing. One of my favorite purchases I made in a while.The app is incredible, I have a pixel 9 pro and the Fitbit app was already installed. Upon connecting my sense 2 to it, it functions even better. I love the nutritional aspect and all of the fitness aspects. Makes it super easy to track in and out calories because it's already done.I primarily do weightlifting/powerlifting/bodybuilding and I'm currently taking a break due to injuries, and using this for everyday fitness is superb. Can't wait to see how it is when I'm back in the gym. The sleep stats are phenomenal as well. I already notice my sleep habits changing.I did notice a few glitchy things, like the weather and sync issues. But these aren't a problem if you give it proper time to catch up. Meaning, if you check it immediately in the morning (like me) it won't sync properly. Just give it 20 mins and go about your routine and it will catch up.Can't recommend this any more. If you're thinking about one, just buy it.",5.0

Fitbit Google Ace Lte,"Finally, after failing twice with Gizmo watches for my older kids, we found success with this watch for my 3rd child. It is simply the best kid's smartwatch we've owned BY FAR.Pro's: This watch looks great, performs above expectations and my daughter loves it.1. The sound quality is more than adequate on the other callers end. It's not perfect on the Fitbit end but it's very close when it comes to clarity.2. The fact that my daughter has to meet certain fitness goals (steps) in order to unlock any game features is such a great idea. She will go out of her way to meet the step goal every day and every month just so she can be earn new games. It's so cool.3. School mode allows the parents to put the watch in a Do Not Disturb mode during school hours in order to keep them from being distracted but still allowing them to accumulate steps4. It looks great5. The touchscreen is responsive and simple to use6. The texting is easy and convenient. Allowing her to talk to text and also send vocal recordings is awesome.7. The tracking feature is very accurateCons:1. The battery drains pretty quickly. It is of course, affected by how much she uses it, but on average it only lasts around 24 hours. Either way, we bought a charger stand made specially for the device and she easily charges it while she sleeps.2. I wish we could just simply press once to toggle school mode. Instead you have to go into settings and find it. It won't allow a single call or text go through in this mode. I bet you're thinking ""That's what it's supposed to do."" You're right, but in an actual emergency while in school mode, she would have no way to reach us and vice versa. I wish there was a simple way to toggle it on both ends. For example, the other day my oldest son dropped my daughter off at her friend's house the other day. Unfortunately, the friends weren't home but my son had already left her there. She's 9, so she freaked out when she realized she was alone. This happened on a snow day so school was cancelled. The watch would not allow my daughter to call us for help. Even though there was no school, the watch was still is school mode. (After crying a while, she's doing great now btw).All of that said, this is well worth the cost!",5.0
Fitbit Google Ace Lte,"Prepare for your child to send you a boat load of poop emojis, haha.Pros- Very fun fast UI with lots to do and explore, encouraging kids to move in fun ways- Bright clear screen- Games require children to first move and be active before playing or the game is active itself- GPS location works very fast. Somehow even faster than Find My for iPhones (works off WiFi).- Text messages, calls and voice messages are quick and responsive (works off WiFi).- Dedicated ACE parental app works very well on iPhone, with good parental controls- Peace of mind of a “closed” ecosystem. My kids can’t message anyone.Neutral- Data plan is independent of any carrier.- Battery life of meh, but it charges very fast. It’ll get though about a day depending on screen brightness and use.Cons- Fitbits historical reputation for reliability and support is very sub-par with some of their devices. Time will tell. This device is well made and operates smoothly so far.Games- Fitness challenges- Scout the fitness coach- Decorate a house with items purchased by movement/activity- Golf and other mini gamesAs a parent I wanted to be able to keep on touch with my kids as they go to friend’s houses, field trips, etc. I also want them to feel that I’m still accessible when they’re away somewhere. My kids are 10 and 7. I feel age 6-13 is the perfect age range for a device like this.This watch costs a good amount more than a Gizmo or other watches. The cost is similar to an Apple Watch SE. But this Fitbit is a purpose-made device for kids unlike the Apple Watch. The Fitbit encourages movement and play. It’s genuinely fun UI is more appealing to kids than the utilitarian Apple Watch UI. In my opinion the Fitbit is also safer to use, limiting their ability to communicate with anyone except myself, my wife, and their siblings.I sincerely hope Fitbit follows the fun gamification philosophy for adult Fitbits as well. What a fun and exciting device to encourage movement and creative play. We immediately bought a second watch for our second younger child.I will update this review if I have anything new to add.",5.0

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,This thing is just not great for how expensive it is. The battery life is TERRIBLE. I basically had to turn off all of the smart watch features to keep the battery from needing to be charged every day. Defeats the purpose of a smart watch. The sleep tracker never detects sleep accurately. After 8h of sleep it pops up that I only slept 45 minutes. I'm pretty sure I would feel horrible if I had only gotten 45 minutes of sleep. The 02 sensor works sometimes and then other times it doesn't. Just overall a real piece of garbage for being so expensive. I'm going to return it and get a Garmin. I purchased it to participate in my health insurance rewards and unfortunately the insurance app is only compatible with Fitbit or Garmin so my options are limited. A Garmin has to be better than this crap!,2.0
Fitbit Inspire 3,"I really love this watch. It has a slim profile and a nice little touch screen. It tells the time. I can see my phone's notifications easily so I don't have to pull out my phone each time. I like the heart rate tracking function. I don't use most of the other activity functions but it has a pretty good step counter too. It has a find phone function that works well as long as you are within Bluetooth range. I've needed that a couple times so far. I'm not crazy about the stop watch feature because you can't start it then go back to the other menus, like looking at the time, without stopping the stop watch. If you can, I haven't figured it out. Battery life is good, I usually charge it once a week or so. It's been completely water resistant when I shower and even had a water lock you can turn on so the water droplets don't trigger touch input. It seems durable enough for regular wear and use, but I wouldn't test crushing it on purpose. App pairing was pretty easy the first time but when I got a new phone I had a little trouble unpairing and repairing to the new phone, I ended up factory resetting it but it isn't really a problem because all your info is stored in the app and cloud. Sleep tracking seems pretty accurate. I do wish I could customize the features a little more, like it does activity tracking with ""zone minutes"" but I really don't care about that, but it still shows up as I tap through the metrics on the watch home screen. Same with calorie burning. Not sure how accurate the calorie burning tracker is.All in all it's a great watch. I wanted a modern style smartwatch without getting something very expensive or really bulky. This is the right watch for the right price.",5.0
Fitbit Inspire 3,"I have an Apple Watch but hate that I had to recharge it every night.  Got this FitBit because it was cheap and wanted something I could wear for a few days and also track my sleep.  This does what I was hoping for and also found the FitBit app to be more useful with what I am tracking vs. the Apple fitness app. I am tracking  my steps, calories burned, calories consumed, weight, water consumption, heart rate and sleep quality / hours.  This FitBit does all that and tracks it in a simple and intuitive app.  I can also wear it when I want to wear a mechanical watch and not look like an idiot wearing two watches (i.e., mechanical watch and apple watch).",5.0
Fitbit Inspire 3,"This is a great, affordable option for people who just need the basics without the bulky build of other smartwatches. It has a sleek look that can be customized with different band options and looks really cute in a bracelet stack. I personally use it to track my heart rate, and I like that it records it overnight for me too. The sleep tracking feature also helps me properly plan my day according to the amount of rest I got to prevent extra fatigue. I've used it in beauty school and outdoors and never experienced any bugs or issues in general (I do take it off if I know I'll be splashing water around, protect your devices), so the functionality is amazing. The different band sizes accommodate a huge range of sizes, but I bought a separate elastic band because the standard ones aren't very comfortable for long-term wear and may cause irritation after a while, especially if you're sweating or washing your hands a lot.",5.0
Fitbit Inspire 3,"I mainly bought this fitbit to monitor my nightly sleep quality, although the overall health monitoring is a plus. 4 sleep stages are monitored: Deep, Light, REM, and Awake. Since it's all monitored at the wrist, the accuracy is unknown; however, the desired 10-20% of deep sleep (of the total) appears to be attained. Also, patterns can be seen, such as decreasing deep sleep if caffeine has been ingested. For O2, it only measures average variance; I wish it would give absolute reading over time like an SPO2 monitor that can be shown on a time chart. Also, the data can be downloaded to local computer, but it is tedious to use for a charting app, and is separated into various folders. It appears that only the fitbit app can use the data easily. It also monitors steps automatically, and exercise (start/stop manually). Other things are monitored, like cardio load, daily exercise, active zone, burned energy, etc. Weight can be input automatically with another app sync. If food and water monitoring is desired, it must be manually input.",4.0

Fitbit Versa 2,"I've had various Fitbit products over the years, and have really liked them, and Fitbit customer service has been great to me.  This is an upgrade from my Charge 2.  The other watch I considered was the Apple 4 (or now 5), but it's twice the price at $399.  The Apple had a EKG (really ECG) that I liked, but was not sure it would be too helpful for me.  And the Fitbit has sleep tracking a feature that the Apple Watch does not come with.  And the battery life on the Fitbit Versa 2 is a lot better with 4-5 days vs. Apple's less than one day (18 hours).The screen is beautiful, a HUGE upgrade.  Lots of clock choices.  There is an always on screen, but I chose to keep it off for now, it uses more power, and it's a very basic black and white, simple screen.  And not sure I always want the screen on, there are times like in a theater or in a dark room where it would be distracting.  A big plus is you can turn auto screen off at night, so it does not come one when you move in your sleep.  A very useful feature, that should save some battery life too.I needed to call customer service as I was having problems getting it added on my Fitbit app.  Since the watch is brand new (released September 15), it needs the latest Fitbit app for it to work.  After that was fixed, there was a bluetooth issue, but after turning it off and on, we were in business.A wonderful upgrade for me.EDIT:  I want to add, the watch bands are so much better than previous one's I've used on Fitbit watches.  I'm guessing they are no different than those on the previous Versa, but they are so much easier to use than those on the Charge 2.  (and I think they will last longer, I had problems with my Charge 2 bands breaking.)",5.0
Fitbit Versa 2,"Love the watch.  The size is perfect.  The screen/resolution is crystal clear.  The selection of bands is great (though changing bands is a bit challenging).  The fabric band that comes with the Special Edition version is great.  Classes it up a fit.  Have also ordered a sport band to wear while playing soccer, swimming, etc.  The device includes nearly all desired features needed for a fitness/smart watch.  It does not have built-in GPS but rather uses connected GPS.  Some may see this as a deal breaker; others will recognize the battery savings that this affords.  And so far, the watch performance has been excellent.There are some reviews that describe Versa failure after getting it wet.  I have successfully showered with the watch with no problem.  I have not yet had a chance to try it in the pool.  Based on the specs it should be fine, but time will tell.  The Versa is not recommended to be worn in hot tubs.As Fitbit has long been a leader in activity tracking, I won’t spend time on those features.  Compared to the Samsung watch that I’ve worn … step counting, heart rate info, calories and sleep tracking all seem to be in line with my historical measurements.  A big benefit is that the Fitbit app is much more robust then the Samsung health app with significantly more data to analyze.The watch software and the battery consumption on both watch and linked phone need some attention.  I’m still trying to determine the optimal settings to achieve a balance of desired performance versus battery life.  With current settings, I can average about 3 days before needing to charge give or take a half day depending on usage.  I’m currently using the always on display which is nice.  It does consume some battery, but so far has not been too heavy of a drain to make the feature unusable.If you choose to use the music app to control music playing on the phone, then expect a massive battery hit.  This functionality requires linking an additional bluetooth connection called Fitbit classic.  It’s my experience that this connection continuously drains the battery on both the watch and the phone -- as much as 20% while sleeping.  That is with the watch in sleep mode and the phone on do not disturb.  I have removed this connection and will control music the old-fashioned way.  Note that this applies ONLY to playing music on the phone and not to connecting to bluetooth earphones.Another setting offered in the Fitbit app is “All-Day Sync.”  This feature constantly updates the data -- activity, heart rate, etc. -- from the watch to the phone.  Sounds good, but it also is a battery hog and I have it disabled.  As far as I know, syncing can be done one of two ways -- either via the all-day setting or manually when you open the app.  I’m currently choosing to update manually.  The developers need to add an option so the devices can be set to sync on a user-defined interval -- hourly, every six hours, daily, etc.  A setting like this exists for nearly every other phone app that requires data to be synced.  Weather apps are the first that come to mind.I am a Samsung user -- Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Buds (wireless earphones).  I can tell you that the Galaxy Buds will not work with the Versa 2 watch (as of 11/26/2019).  The Buds will link, but they will not play audio.  Something to do with different types of bluetooth used in the devices.  The issue is discussed in several online forums, but no word from Fitbit or Samsung if it will ever be addressed or fixed.  The watch does pair to the S10 without issue and works perfectly well.  All notifications are received timely and the bluetooth connection is much better/stronger than with my previous Samsung watch.  It easily stays connected at 30-40 feet.There are a couple of issues that need to be addressed related to phone notifications on the watch.  First, Gmail is the only client that is available as the ""default"" mail application.  Or, at least it is in my Fitbit app.  I can select to be notified by other email apps from my phone, but Gmail is the only app that can be set to receive ""special"" notification treatment according to the Fitbit app.  Secondly, alarms on the phone (and I use quite a few) are NOT available to notify on the Versa.  This feature would be a big plus to me.  You can set 8 alarms on the Versa.  However, each alarm uses some battery, and I would simply be duplicating alarms on multiple devices.  For example, I would not remove an alarm from my phone as I may need it while the watch is charging or not being worn.To correct other reviews that I've seen, music CAN be uploaded and stored on the watch.  The process requires using the desktop app and is a bit slow, but it works.  IF I had wireless headphones that connected properly, then I could play music direct from the Versa without the phone.One other small issue is that weather info does not exist on the clock face by default.  Third party clock faces can be installed, but I’ve found that they often require a separate setting for weather updates, which then only work if the All-Day Sync option is enabled.  I’m continuing to search for alternatives to see what options exist.There are quite a few apps available for download and use on the watch.  I haven't found any to be all that relevant or helpful to me.  At least not yet.  But the platform and functionality are there to use if desired.Also, I need to mention that the Alexa integration is great.  We have a heavy investment in Echo devices in our household, so to have the same functionality on my wrist is a great bonus.If, like me, you are apple averse, then this is one of the best smart watches available that I have found.  And very affordable.  At this point, I would rate it 8 out of 10.  And I would certainly increase that rating with continued additions to and improvement in the software, connectivity and watch features.**UPDATE 12/9/2019**Fitbit released a firmware update a few days ago which added some great features.  The Versa now saves your 5 most recently used clock faces and you can change them on the fly without having to go to the app.  Though there are tons of clock faces to choose from, one of the drawbacks with Fitbit is that you cannot flag, save or otherwise have access to your favorite faces.  You have to keep a manual list of the names or just remember so that you can find them again.  There needs to be a way to store a list of favorite faces and apps so that you can access and install them quickly.Other updates include that you can now customize the action of the side button, the sleep score is displayed on the watch, the list of exercises to choose from has expanded, and by reports the heart rate data has been improved.So I've learned that one of the tricks to manage battery life and connectivity is to restart the watch after making certain changes, such as switching to a new clock face.  You may notice that the Versa stops sending notifications or is not syncing to the app.  I've found that after a quick restart, the watch works perfectly again.  Maybe it's a software glitch, but at least there is an easy workaround.  And if you leave the watch alone, then these issues should not occur.For full functionality of the watch, including some features of many clock faces, I have re-enabled the All-Day Sync setting.  The watch and app perform much better with the setting enabled.  And unless I receive a ton of notifications or am constantly playing with the settings, I am now getting 4 to 5 days of battery life which is great.  This could also very well have something to do with the recent software update.  I am not currently using the always on display.  I estimate that AOD cuts the battery life by 30 to 50 percent.Also, before you make a decision with the help of reading these spectacular reviews, you might gauge the quality of the reviews.  This watch is by no means perfect and may not be the best choice for you, but you should decide that for yourself.  Then return it if you're not satisfied.  This is an electronic device and there can be duds.  Some buyers have expressed frustration after receiving a device that was dead on arrival.  Completely understandable.But there are many 1-star reviews that are not from a literate source.  A two word review that reads ""hate it"" is not helpful.  One review reads only ""no fitbit pay"" which is completely untrue.  The Versa absolutely has Fitbit Pay.  Also, I'm intrigued that apple phone users don't just pair their phone with an apple watch.  Not sure why they are shocked that the Versa does not work as seamlessly for them as a product designed by their phone maker.  Bottom line ... be your own judge.As referenced in my original review, I have updated my rating of the Versa 2 to a 9 out of 10, based on performance and recent software updates.  Hopefully my positive experience will continue.",5.0
Fitbit Versa 2,"I LOVE THIS DEVICE! This is my 3rd Versa 2. First one that gives me email updates, Facebook messages, and calls. 116 bucks and change.

Fitbit Versa 2,"I use this in my every day life now that I own it, it helps me manage my phone calls and texts really well.As for the fitness aspect of it, it's decent, but lacking in a lot of aspects as well. The step tracking is nearly completely inaccurate: turning in my sleep after midnight counts steps for the next day, I can wake up with up to 200 steps already taken, and trust me, that's not sleepwalking. Not only that, but when I go through a particularly intense car ride (my coworker... loves to hit well over the speed limit sometimes. And in alaska, you get ice heaves in the road, which can make for a VERY bumpy ride.) I end up with my daily stairs count going up.The sleep tracking could be better, it's based on heart rate so you have to really go under for it to start tracking, which might mean a few minutes of sleep are shaved off as you get to homeostasis.The battery is exactly as advertised so far, it lasts about 3-4 days before I recharge it, and could probably go at least a little bit longer than that depending on use.My main complaint is Alexa: she's totally useless trapped in this tiny little watch. ""Set a timer for 10 minutes"" ""I'm afraid I can't do that Dave"" ""Why not"" ""Please stop screaming at me"" the conversations go on, but nothing ever gets done with Alexa, she's just kind of *there* for when you want to force it to shut off by pressing the button for a long time.TL;DR Good for recording a basic outline of how active you really are in your day, exercise and sleep tracking are decent but wonky and more inaccurate as you go on, and Alexa is useless go get an echo or something if you want a useful Alexa device.",4.0

Fitbit Versa Lite Smartwatch,"I stopped using my Fitbit just last week & I've never been more happy.For a company to continue to churn out more expensive & feature-laden ""activity"" watches throughout the years, it's almost unfathomable why it would degrade its user experience year after year.It has been a love/hate relationship ever since I bought the original Versa (after upgrading from a Charge given to me by a friend, & up until then I thought Fitbits were useless, trendy gadgets) because when the watch & app/software work, it's a very useful tool with a lot of data & information to help keep a person motivated & track their progress... but the inconsistency of the heart rate monitor, problems with syncing, app updates that are forced upon users otherwise their watch stops working with the app, non-existent customer service and/or totally inefficient customer care made life with a Fitbit one of frustration.Due to these factors & probably more, I vowed to myself to never spend another dime on a terrible company like Fitbit...but my Versa died in early 2020 (with an almost offensive lack of customer support to try & help) & I read some good things about the Samsung Galaxy activity watch so I switched & started using that, but with a terrible app & an even worse heart rate monitor & active time logger I broke my vow & purchased this Vera Lite.Even worse than the Versa, the heart rate monitor & problems with syncing on the Versa Lite I soldiered on because the app data & statistics are very helpful even if there are some discrepancies.But the final straw & what made me finally jump ship was the firmware upgrade pushed out late September/early October, as I had seen multiple complaints on the new ""zone minutes"" by beta testers posted on Fitbit's forum... yet Fitbit still forced this upgrade out to its user base, and as soon is it went out to, I'm assuming, thousands of users, the forum was flooded with average users confused & angry & wanting the old ""activity minutes"" back instead of this new ""zone minutes"" garbage.Not to mention all the complaints about their Fitbits not syncing anymore, getting bricked & staying on the Fitbit startup logo, not turning on at all, Fitbit ""updating"" their list of compatible phones so that users having problems now after the upgrade were officially SOL despite their watch & phone being compatible before... this all made me very scared so I dismissed the upgrade as long as I could (maybe 10-12 days), closing out the banner at the top of the app EVERY single time I opened it or refreshed the screen, but of course, after so many days my watch stopped syncing with my Samsung Ultra+ (& also my old Samsung S8, which I always used as a backup to sync with when the Fitbit was being temperamental with my Ultra+) & I had no choice but to upgrade the firmware.And exactly what you'd expect to happen did in fact happen: my watch wouldn't sync with either of my phones at all anymore...& I wound following the god-awful advice that is copy & pasted on Fitbit's forums for almost every single issue a user has, which is a long list of absolutely inconvenient & obtuse set of instructions that seem more long-winded & complex than dismantling an atomic bomb.I did the first couple of steps, anyway... & then my phone never was able to re-sync with the Fitbit & I gave up...I downloaded a step-tracker because I have my phone in my pocket 95% of the time anyway, it seems quite accurate, & MyFitnessPal gives the option to add exercises with caloric expenditure calculated for you already & now I'm finally free.",1.0
Fitbit Versa Lite Smartwatch,"I thought I did my research well enough on this device, but I was mistaken. I really wanted to love this smartwatch/fitness tracker. I don't have a lot of needs, but I need them all met, and based on the spec sheet and advertised featureset this should cover everything.What I liked about this device:- Long battery life- Lightweight- Gets all my app notifications- Fitness trackingWhat the marketing material doesn't say:- Setup is a nightmare. The device ships with a firmware version that needs to be plugged into a PC in order to be able to update itself to a firmware version that can update OTA; except Windows 10 doesn't recognize the device when plugged in and Fitbit doesn't have drivers available on their website. Then once you get the device updated, there's still a slew of connectivity issues getting the device to pair properly with your phone.- The app notifications are inconsistent at best. There aren't many apps I actually want notifications from, but the few I do want I need them consistently. Sometimes they come through and everything is great, and other times they don't come at all and the troubleshooting steps to fix them is to reinstall the Fitbit software, reconfigure the device (and all of its settings), and restart both my phone and the watch.Here's the kicker: these are problems occurring in the first 24 hours! I haven't even had the device for a full day yet and I'm having all these problems. My last smartwatch, an LG G Watch R, was made in 2014 and didn't have any of these problems. It's 2020 Fitbit, this level of inadequacy is unacceptable.This device is a sleek and stylish fitness tracker, and does those tasks well enough, but if that was all I wanted there are better devices (even better Fitbit devices) that do that job. I bought the Versa Lite because I needed app notifications, and having to reconfigure the device daily isn't going to work out for me.I'm giving this a few more days to see if things stabilize before I return it.---EDIT: I've owned this for a week. The setup process is a nightmare because it ships with a buggy version of the firmware, and there's no way to force or sideload the update. You just have to wait DAYS until the device finally decides to update. After the update, many of the problems went away.Coincidentally, I got myself a new phone about a day after I got the update and once I paired the FitBit to my new phone things that never worked on my old phone suddenly worked on the new one.Pre-update + old phone: 2/5 starsPost-update + old phone: 3/5 starsPost-update + new phone: 4/5 starsI'll be updating my rating from 2 stars to 4 stars because once it's fully updated it's everything I wanted from it, but the horrible out-of-the-box experience cannot be overlooked. Word of advice: if you do decide to buy this, aim to get it a week before you actually want to start using it!",4.0
Fitbit Versa Lite Smartwatch,"I switched from a Blaze 2 years ago to a Garmin Forerunner 235. Now that I'm not running anymore, I switched back to a Fitbit. My husband bought me this as an early birthday present and it is amazing. Fitbits in general are the best activity tracker, in my humble opinion. They're fun, pretty, easy to navigate and very encouraging with the confetti and fire works as we reach our goals. I asked for the Lite version because I didn't care for all the other options the Versa had and this suits all of my needs. The screen is bright and battery life is longish at 3/4 days.The only thing I'll miss about my Garmin is the built in GPS but the pros far outweigh the one con.I wouldn't trade this particular Fitbit for any other model or activity tracker.

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,"Had the Charge 2 for a while and loved it. Then switched to the latest apple watch at the encouragement of a few friends. While that apple watch was nice for the few months I wore it, I found I was not using a lot of the features in it that may have been why it was double the cost of the Versa. On the apple watch I found the battery would not last more than 36 hours and the phone app was no where near what Fitbit had in terms of activity and sleep tracking as well as just overall display of the many data points.When the Versa came out I said why not try it, hearing how slim it was and the extended battery life. It was that or go back to my Charge 2 that is also a fantastic tracker. My goal was to get back to the Fitbit app. I love this watch/fitness tracker and know this is going to be a huge hit for Fitbit. The app I love is now back in my life for the detailed activity and sleep tracker and the battery life is nearly as good as my Charge 2. I have gotten five days of battery life on the Fitbit Versa already - this is with a 45 minute workout on each of those five days included. At the end of the five days I was at 28% remaining, telling me I had another day or two of charge remaining. The texts all come through, the watch rings when I get a all on my iPhone, the screen is crystal clear, the watch itself is very slim compared to apple(no bump on the underside), there must be hundreds of clock faces to choose from, and it has all the apps I could think of needing in the watch store (the store is already noticeably growing). This is the fitness tracker\watch to get. Very impressed and kudos to Fitbit for a well thought out fitness focused watch that is a true competitor to the apple watch.Just a quick comment on the setup of the Versa. I saw a few comments here about how the setup took 30 minutes or so to complete with an update. My comment is so what? I just put my Versa on the charger, used the app to update it, walked away, came back and wha-la - it was done! It hasn't stopped since!Enjoy!",5.0
Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,"I had an original Huawei smart watch that I loved every thing about except battery life. I could get a day out of it if I only used it for a watch and notifications. If I tried to make use of many apps on it then I could forget it lasting a whole day. It was nice to have Google assistant to control my smart home but unfortunately it quit taking a charge so I started looking for something new.I decided battery life was important for me as I couldn't use many of the ""smart"" features anyway on the Huawei due to battery life impact. And I wanted to have better fitness integration also.I decided to go with the Fitbit Versa and I am glad I did. It is well documented how well the battery life and fitness tracking work so I will not say more than it does a better job than I expected and I love the sleep tracking!I want to talk about the smart watch side of the Versa. Of course I wish I could talk to it and use Google assistant but I will give it up for battery life. I wanted to be able to control music and podcasts playback from my watch and was worried how this was going to work. All I had to do was go into settings and enable notifications from the apps I want to control and then I can start a play list or podcast on my phone. From the watch I only have swipe down, open the notification, and the controls are there! I used to build my own watchfaces on the Huawei watch with the ""watch maker"" app. I found a similar app in the fitbit app store called ""maker"". I haven't tried it yet as I am happy with the fitbit watch face I am using for now, but I am happy to the option is there for when I get bored and want to change things up later. It was nice being able to control my smartthings lights with the Google assistant on the Huawei but I can use my phone if needed and I have Alexa and Google home all over my house for that so it is less important. There is an app called ""switchr"" that will let me press buttons on my Versa to control them but I have not figured it out yet. That's my fault not the Versa as I have not used IFTTT much and I need to fix things on that end.Overall this is the perfect watch for me. It has all of the smarts that I care about. Of course Fitbit has the fitness part down as that's what they are known for. And I get the best of both worlds with great battery life. The Versa is small, lightweight, comfortable, and the best looking square watch In my opinion. I can't get over how thin the Versa is compared to other smart watches. It is thinner than some old dumb digital watches I have seen. Fitbit really got this one right!",5.0
Fitbit Sense Advanced Smartwatch,"Really like my Sense. I’ve had a Fitbit for about five years and find them to be very reliable and mostly accurate. CAUTION, do NOT depend on heart rate beyond normal resting and exercising pulse. I had afib with a pulse of 300 at the emergency room but my Fitbit said my pulse was normal and my heart health was excellent. Remember, this is not a medical device although it can provide some interesting health information. I also like that the battery lasts for days.",5.0
Fitbit Sense Advanced Smartwatch,"UPDATE: 2 FULL YEARS later practically to the date. My SENSE crapped out. Was a good Smartwatch up until it just started not working (only showed fitbit icon, intermittent vibration, would work for a few hours, then go back to showing nothing. Was a quick death). Not changing rating as all these gadgets are basically throw aways. Now back to original review:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Probably want to select reviews based on ""most recent"" as that will provide you with most up to date and relevant information pertaining to this product. I acquired my Fitbit Sense in June 2021, it has not yet been a month, but so far so good with 24/7 use. I am slow to check out and use all the features, but what I have interacted with so far has been stellar.I have been using Fitbit products since April 2015- kinda have a love/hate relationship with this brand. I use the activity tracker constantly, and I greatly enjoy the app. So I have stuck with it as I upgraded over the years (Charge x2, Blaze x2, Versa 2, and now Sense). As with many Fitbit users, there is a known frustration with the products. Despite some of my own qualms, and having the ability to spend whatever I want on any fitness tracker I want, I still end up (so far) with this brand. Mostly because I haven't found a tracker and app that I totally like better. I even have a Garmin, but I find that so far off base of accuracy (save for HR), that it is a glorified watch. Garmin seems to do best for actual intended activities (going for a run, going for a long walk, going cycling) where it seems to not be accurate in steps for any other part of the day (only counts about 1/3 of actual steps unless engaged in a longer duration activity, and even then it takes a few minutes for it to start). Also, the app seems to have a lot of info, but doent really tell me anything. That being said, when it was time for me to buy another fitness tracker--I went from Versa 2 to Garmin.. back to Fitbit. I went with the Sense because the price was right, and it was an upgrade over the Versa 2.  After my underwhelming experience with the Garmin, I would have happily taken over a 2nd hand Charge from 2015. At least my steps would be accurate.Ok, so back to the Sense. WOW, the visual on the screen is really clear and precise. Even way more so over the Versa 2, and I had no issues with that. Set up was EASY, and QUICK.  Basically, just like in adding any other fitbit, just let it pair and it will very quickly be all set and ready to go. I didnt have any weird upselling offerings, or at least nothing that wasn't fantastically easy to opt out from. Nothing shady that I saw.ONE POINT that I DO think is important to know is that if you happen to have a Versa 2 (Not sure if this also happens with regular Versa, Versa Lite, or Versa 3), but this could not be added alongside my Versa 2. I had to take the Versa 2 offline in order to add this Sense. I know this is the case with trying to add more than one of the same products, yet I have always been able to have several Fitbits paired no problem, as long as they were different models. SO, I guess the Fitbit app sees Sense and Versa 2 as the same. Not a big deal as my Versa 2 had essentially died after I wore it on a hot humid day and my sweat killed it (then I brought it back to life after putting it in a bag of rice for about a week, Then afterward the battery was never the same. It drained to nothing daily.. and I needed to not have to worry about daily charging.. hence my picking up a Garmin in the interim to see if I liked them enough to spring for a more fancy model--nope-- and ended up buying the Sense.)Hope it lasts. I love the look. The band is way better than the old pin style. Swapping out bands is so much quicker, easier, less need for super fine motor skills. LOVE the charger. It just sort of magnetizes to the fitbit. No need to clip in.SP02 wasn't the main feature I was drawn to, but in order to have accurate use it seems a special clock face is needed, and that clock face will drain battery quicker (from what I have read). That being said,Battery life has been excellent for me.Love being able to add other apps, and features.  Scrolling is easy, turning face on/off is not complicated.HEART RATE is accurate. I have tested it against my garmin, two blood pressure devices, and a doctors appointment. All saying the same.Also, I the voice assistant is great. You can choose GOOGLE Assistant, OR Alexa. This is why selecting most recent reviews on this sort of stuff is important, as the early release of Sense did not have Google Assistant, but would soon with an update. True, and they followed through as I have it.AT THIS TIME, I have ZERO issues, concerns with this Fitbit Sense. I will be back to update as I learn more, or if I have anything worth sharing that is bad. I keep up with my reviews as needed.",5.0
Fitbit Sense Advanced Smartwatch,"The watch is great with calories, zone minutes and steps! It also records quality of sleep, which is great to keep track of. The only problem I have is the distance, which seems to be an issue. The watch has a problem distinguishing between miles and kilometers, and doesn’t record my 5 miles until I’ve walked 8.05 miles (8.05 kilometers=approximately 5 miles). Fitbit seems to be aware of this issue, but has not corrected it. Overall a great fitness watch, just some software kinks that haven’t been solved.",4.0
Fitbit Sense Advanced Smartwatch,"Updated Review:I initially gave it a 4 Star rating but just changed it to 5 Stars. I was having difficulty with viewing the daily rating of my Oxygen while sleeping. Some times it would register, other times it would not. I finally discovered that it was measuring my O2 level all the time. The results does not show up right away as you have to wait for a short time to appear.It did show me an upward trend in my temperature, resting heart rate, temperature variability with a downward trend in my Heart Rate Variability (HRV) when I came down with a nasty cold. I could trace it to the date it started.Original Review:The watch is pretty stylish. Comparing it to my sister's huge Samsung watch, this watch is sleeker and filled with more health features than hers.For accuracy, it is pretty good, but not perfect. I walked exactly 100 steps by counting them out, and the Sense showed 102. I'm pretty impressed with that. The sleep feature seems accurate when it measures the time fell asleep until the time I woke up. Even though it may not be totally accurate against more accurate medical-grade devices, it does give me a baseline and I can measure my progress from that. The heartbeat rate is pretty much on target but I haven’t tested it above 120 where some people have issues with it being accurate.What I find inaccurate: 1) the stairs counter. It misses counting about 4 out of 5 times. If I go down the stairs to the main floor and then back up again, I count 32 steps. 2) I find the SpO2 function pretty useless. First, it is not anywhere close when compared with two actual SpO2 devices. Secondly, sometimes it records while sleeping and other nights it fails to record for no known reason. There are a number of similar complaints and frustration on the Fitbit forum about this same problem. Also, you must use their clock face to record, which I find inconvenient. So, if you are thinking about getting this watch primarily for that feature, I would caution you.Other than that complaint, the watch is quite nice. The charging device is genius, you bring it near the watch, and it instantly connects. Charging times are very short, so that's a big plus. If you use it to record your sleep and then throughout the day, you might get 2 to 3 days between charges.Nice to have the texting and phone calls feature. Sometimes when I have my phone on vibrate only, I miss the call, but now with the Sense, I feel the vibration on my wrist notifying me of who it is. I can read a partial window of the text message too. When my phone is not on vibrate, I can text the person back through the voice feature. I can answer the call and talk to them through my watch; however, you have to hold the phone near your ear to hear them as the speaker is pretty weak.There is a learning curve if you are a first-time Fitbit user. This is true with the watch and with the App. The App is filled with many graphs and features. It will take some time to learn where they all are located, but eventually you will be able to navigate and find them. Speaking of navigation, if you swipe down on the watch to delve deeper into an app, you can swipe back up, but you cannot go back to the previous feature or forward to the next. You must press the button to go back home first where you must start your navigation over. I hope Fitbit improves upon this feature in the future.The silicone watch band was quite difficult to clasp and unclasp. It wasn't the most comfortable either, possibly because my wrist was in between the sizing holes. The nice feature of the band is that it only takes a couple of seconds to change them out. I purchased a nice elastic one-piece band that allows me to take the watch off and put it back on within 2 to 3 seconds. Here is the Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KFFSHBH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1&psc=1 and there are two sizes. I do recommend this band as it comes in a variety of colors and patterns.So, in conclusion, would I recommend this watch? I would say yes as long as you are not needing it for the SpO2 feature which I find unreliable.",5.0

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,"This is my third Fitbit in one year.  Beware of Fitbits....  Bought the first one for my wife for Christmas, about 6 months ago.  It died within two weeks.  So I reached out to Amazon, and was able to get a replacement due to how quickly it failed.  So I started using the second one, that one failed after a couple of months, in March, just beyond the return window.  I was not able to get a replacement due to timing....  so I bought a refurbished one.  Now I am in June, and the refurbished onehas now failed.  So this is the third failure of a fitbit I was using within 6 months, and only one of the failures was fast enough to generate a warranty replacement.  With this type of dependability, and support, I should  have and will likely now just buy something cheaper and generic, since the support from and dependability of Fitbit doesn't seem to be any better than those ""Generic"" products, but without the expensive price tag that leaves you feeling like you have been taken advantage of buy choosing their product.",1.0

It will say it’s 100% charge. I’ll put it on and as soon as I Exercise within 40 minutes it’s completely dead. I have called two different representatives on hold forever. They said there’s nothing they can do because the first person that purchased it bought it in 2020 or 2021 and the warranty is gone. I didn’t even buy it until 2024 of January and it already broke by the time it was January 2025. so. It said nothing about an expiredcwatranty when I bought the watch. Normally, I always buy brand new but I did not want to spend top dollar on something that I knew would break anyway. I pleaded with them to replae it or be able to buy one for half price or 75% off if they did not replace it for free. All they offered was a 35% off coupon and that is not acceptable. I’m very disappointed. I loved wearing a Fitbit when I exercise.

Fitbit Versa 2,"I was a little bit wary of buying a used product. However, my Fitbit game in absolutely perfect condition. There are no signs of wear whatsoever, not even the tiniest scratch! The display is just stunning and so pleasing to look at. So far, the battery life has been incredible. It came at around 56% when I first turned it on, and is at 51% now 24 hours later. The step tracking, heart rate monitor,  and calories burned seems to be good so far, and are all very convenient features to be able to see so easily and quickly. I have not yet used the sleep tracking function yet. I really like being able to see texts, calls, and the time without needing to carry my phone with me everywhere I go, especially at work when I'm frequently moving around but need to watch the time closely. Pairing the Fitbit with my phone was seamless and fast. Also, the watch just looks so pretty and compliments any outfit well. Even just wearing the watch has motivated me to get more movement in. I'm not sure if I will try to go swimming with this watch any time soon, just in case. Overall, I am beyond satisfied with this purchase. I will try to provide an update in the future to see if the watch continues to hold up and be as good as it seems now.",5.0
Fitbit Versa 2,Fitbit is in pretty good condition for being refurbished.  Some light scratching on the face that you can really only see in the right light.  .Taking away a star because the band that came with is nearly impossible to put on the watch.  It's too wide and the silicone has to be squished for there to even be a chance to get it on the watch.  I did have another band from a previous Fitbit that worked perfectly.And also the battery doesn't last as sling as I'd like.  Fully changed to 90% after using the workout function for 35 minutes.  And then drains slightly throughout the day.  I have to charge it every few days or so.  My other Fitbit would last over a week on a charge.

Fitbit Versa 2,"I ordered this because I swear by my Fitbit for fitness but I misplaced my old one and decided to purchase this one because of it's fast delivery. I was a little hesitant when I saw it was refurbished, and was even more convinced that I was potentially a armed when I couldn't get it to sync. However I immediately (same day of delivery) messaged back letting them know the issue and requested a new one be since. I only waited two days for it to arrive and it worked perfectly. I really appreciate the swift service and fixing of my issue.",5.0
Google Pixel Watch 3,"This is a fantastic watch.  I've been a long-time Fossil smartwatch user.  My Fossil Gen 6 watch started acting up, and I recently learned that Fossil has exited smartwatches.  Once I switched to the Pixel 3, I was thrilled and do not miss my Gen 6 at all.  I should have switched sooner.My 2nd Fossil replacement alternative was the OnePlus 2.  The Pixel looked better (to me) and has Wear OS 5 which is the most recent version.  It was hard to decide between the two using online descriptions and reviews, but I am happy with my choice.  The Pixel battery life is better than the Fossil, even with the always on display, and easily gets me though the day.  The charge may not last as long as the OnePlus 2, but I do not wear it overnight and instead put the watch on the charger, so the extra battery life is not an issue for me.  Others may see this differently.The Pixel 3 screen is MUCH brighter and sharper than the Fossil, the processor is faster, and the watch operation is intuitive and easy to learn.  Activating the watch, setting it up, and switching from the Fossil was quick and easy since most of the apps and info are tied to my Google account.Long-time irritants with the Fossil were how the end of the watch band kept flopping loose from its holder band, and how the crown button constantly activated when I sharply bent my wrist.  The Pixel fixes both of these issues.  The Pixel watch band is a bit tricky to attach at first (YouTube helps), but it works MUCH better than the Fossil and is more comfortable.  The Pixel has a nice feature where you can rotate the watch display 180 degrees (make it upside down) so you can wear the crown button on the left side of the watch.  No more accidental app activations, restarts, or 911 calls!My primary watch use is for business to monitor emails and texts, and to see/screen/take phone calls.  All these work beautifully, and are handled much better than with the Fossil.  Even the weather app is upgraded in the new OS, and there is a timer that can be added to the tiles.  I use my watch secondarily for the health features, and I was sad (at first) to learn Google Fit would not be on the Pixel.  I used Fit on the Fossil to track steps and distance walked.  The new FitBit basic version is a true upgrade and gives me all the info I had before, plus a lot more.  I did not opt for the free Premium FitBit trial.I bought and recommend a set of the plastic watch covers for scratch and impact protection, and a charging stand.  Both work great.",5.0
Google Pixel Watch 3,"LOVE this watch!I bought this to track POTS and monitor for other heart symptoms.

Google Pixel Watch 3,What can I say? It's a Google product. I've had very little issues with this product and it seems to be a nice improvement over the previous models. Connectivity is good.

It has improved as well,5.0
Google Pixel Watch 3,"I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.  When my Fitbit Versa died I waited a while before buying another. Instead I tried a couple of cheaper watches but didn't like the app they used.  I missed the Fitbit app.  I didn't want to order another Versa so I decided to try the Google Pixel 3 even though the watch was round and not square as my previous watch.  However,  I find it much more comfortable to wear and it's more attractive than I thought it would be.  I love how it functions and the choices of watch faces.  I also like the fall notification feature since I'm in my 80's.  I normally don't write reviews unless I feel strongly about something.  I felt compelled to share my joy with this watch.  Glad I bought it.",5.0
Google Pixel Watch 3,Absolutely love my smart watch! This is my first brand name smart watch and I'm very satisfied with it. I like that it has Fitbit technology integrated with it as well.

Fitbit Versa 4,"So far it has been poor.. I am afraid I received a 'returned' watch..  the box seal was broken when I received this. I would have taken a photo of the watch, but to what good? When I tried to charge it, the Fitbit logo popped up as it should.. but then it went off and the face went black. I tried to charge for over 2 hours but nothing appeared...  ever! (even after I did some trouble shooting and attempted to 'reset' the watch as directed. The watch vibrated, the logo popped up, the NOTHING, again) I have returned this product to Amazon in hopes of receiving one that works.  If that happens I will post a new rating. I presently have a Versa 2 that has worked great. I was replacing it only because I know it's battery is starting to go (I've had it for over 3 years).. it needs charging more often, and I felt an upgrade would be nice. The sad part is that I received a Fitbit Charge 6 for Christmas and returned it because I wanted some additional features. I hope I receive a NEW Versa 4 this time.",1.0
Fitbit Versa 4,"I have always had Fitbit watches from the Charge version then the Versa 2 and now the Versa 4.  I love how the watchband clips on each end compared to the Versa 2 where you have to finagle the watchband in.  I am still learning all the Versa 4 can do.  There are somethings I like better with the Versa 2:  selecting the exercise mode I want to do vs the Versa 4.  Love the battery life on the Versa 4.  I had to charge the Versa2 everyday but it is an older one - I bought from Amazon in 2019 so I would say I got my moneys worth out of the Versa2.  Like I said, I am still learning all the benefits offered by the Versa 4 so once I am really familiar, I will update this review but so far, I am liking it.",5.0

Fitbit Sense Health & Fitness,"I have order 4 of the Fitbit Sense 1 watches and had to return all of them.  This watch is obsolete likely due to Fitbit not updating it's software to operate correctly with legacy products.  There are many know problems with this watch and they are likely the reason Fitbit created the Sense 2.1) The button designed to pull you back to the home screen rarely works.2) The heart rate monitor is wildly inaccurate which leads to inaccurate measurements with exercise, sleep and the other cardio functions.The screen shots are of stairmaster sessions I had.  I wore a chest strap heart rate monitor and that device showed my heart rate moving from about 100 to 150 in a linear path.  At no point did my heart rate drop more than a few beats.  You can see the Fitbit charts depict an implausible scenario.  This has been the case with all 4 of the Sense watches I have had.I have followed suggestions found on the internet Appling water between the watch and my skin; wearing the watch tighter, looser, over the wrist and under the wrist.  None of these things make a difference.It's extremally likely that Fitbit is making software updates without ensuring that the updates are compatible with their legacy products.  This happens with most software companies and it appears to be the case here.If you are going to order a Fitbit product order the current model if you expect it to work as intended.  At a minimum, stay away from the Sense 1.",1.0
Fitbit Sense Health & Fitness,I will say I have purchased this watch 3 times. Every 18 approximately it stops taking a charge. But while it works it is great. This time I purchased the warranty so when or if this happens again I should be covered. I will say after the second time I did buy a different watch but it did not compare to this one. Price is decent and the size and weight is very similar to an ordinary watch. I like the notifications for calls and move.,5.0

Fitbit Sense Health & Fitness,"This is a great watch, but I'm honestly not sure I would buy it again. I'm writing this just after my watch that was 15 months old just died (blue diamond of death).Here is what I love about the watch: the batter lasts for several days, it has great watch faces to choose from, the steps and always-on heart rate monitoring is so nice to have, it has very customizable notifications for things like texts and calendar reminders, there is a huge selection of bands you can purchase to customize the look, it seems to have very accurate determinations of calories burned for exercises.When the watch became unresponsive, with a screen showing just a blue diamond (it's a thing, look it up...), I tried everything to reset/revive it. I even spoke to the customer service at fitbit/google, who were honestly super nice and helpful in trouble shooting. Unfortunately, they confirmed that the watch was truly dead and, at 15 months, was beyond the 12 month warranty. So the best they would offer me was 30% off another product from their store.So buyer beware. It's a great watch, but you are paying for a VERY short-lived consumer product.",3.0

Fitbit Sense Health & Fitness,"I’ve owned one of these for a long time and love it! I’ve also gotten it for others and was a hit for those who needed a smart watch. Had to return one recently due to family not wanting it, but that’s beyond the point. Excellent software and data points. Shows you real time heart rate data and allows text and call input. Weather and other telemetry are available on the fly. Sleep pattern tracking is wonderful and you pay no extra for that feature! Comfortable to wear and sleep with on. It is waterproof and have on many occasions just left it on during a shower and was fine. It’s sleek and modern and has a good weight to it. I’d recommend this over the Apple Watch, you can change faces for free and don’t have to purchase extra apps. It just works out of the box and is a quality product. Cost a little but, but good things that last do. Comes with a charge cable, you’ll need a wall plug with USB. But the best part days without needing a charge. Great battery life. The wrist bands material is nice and doesn’t cause rashes for me either.",5.0

Fitbit Sense Health & Fitness,"Love the look of the watch. It keeps tract of what it states. The only thing I don't like is, you have to sleep 7 hours for it to record your SPO2 .  That was the one thing I really wanted to track. I hardly ever sleep that long",4.0

Fitbit Sense Health & Fitness,Just what I needed,5.0
Fitbit Sense Health & Fitness,"I upgraded to the Fitbit Sense after my Versa 2, which I loved, died. I thought that, since it was a newer product, that it would be better. It still has all the functions I liked on the Versa 2 and I do like the addition of stress monitoring and skin temperature tracking. Also, now I don't need a special clock face to have SPO2 monitoring, which is good. But overall, I was greatly disappointed.First, it regularly loses connection with the phone/app, even when the phone is less than five feet away. I am also seeing a lot more sync errors than I saw with the Versa 2. Sometimes, even when the watch has synced and I can see things like my sleep score in the app, it won't show on the watch for hours.Some of the features I was looking forward to, like snore detection and SPO2 monitoring, are a battery suck. The watch is advertised as having 6+ days of battery life, but my initial experience had me needing to charge it every day. After several attempts to find the problem through customer service, I was told to turn off the snore monitoring. This increased the life to about 5 days. It makes no sense to me that they would not make sure that the battery supports the use of a built-in function. I have also had several issues with the watch somehow, on its own, opening the exercise app and getting stuck there. The only way to get out of it has been to restart the watch.The watch band is another problem. The design of the band for the newer smart watches is awful. As seen in pictures, instead of the end of the band being secured under a loop, this one has a tuck under design so that the end is sandwiched between the strap and your skin. This design is uncomfortable and has caused a lot of chafing on my wrist. This is something that I never experienced with the Versa 2 watch band. The only good thing I can say about this new design is that it is easier to change the band as it just clips in rather than needing to fuss and fumble with the pins on traditional watch bands.I am mostly happy with the Sense. It does what I need it to and the issues I have faced are not enough to keep me from getting another Fitbit product in the future. I just hope the issues I am having, and those I have seen in others' reviews, are addressed in future product designs.",3.0

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,I bought this to track steps and exercise. I replaced a charge 2 with the Versa. I do very light jogging every hour during the day.  This monitor will say my heart rate is 160 to 175 during this activity. This is completely incorrect. I’m not even winded during this activity.

Fitbit Versa Smart Watch,"I have bought every Fitbit that the company made to include this one. I even bought the scale and two sets of Flyers. I really enjoy each watch and I am a big fan of Fitbit’s. I enjoy the look of the Versa and the feel of it. It is lighter the the Ionic, which is a great watch too. Amazon delivered it at a timely matter. No problems with Amazon at all. However, after ordering the Versa, I found out that you cannot have two watches (I have the ionic and this one now) working simultaneously on one account. I did not know this until after I ordered the watch and tried to cancel the order upto 3 hours later but it was too late. In order for me to wear them both using the same account is to sync all the latest stats then delete the one watch and put the other watch on the account. This takes over about 30 minutes for the switch over time and you must have WiFi. The second  watch then states that you walked zero steps but your phone app states the correct amount of steps added from both watches. I walk over 42,000 to 45,000 steps per day. I need to walk a certain amount of steps per hour to achieve this total. After switching watches, I would need my phone app to see if I am achieving my hourly goal. I cannot do this at times because I cannot have my phone while I work.  Also, a very tiny dislike to this watch, is that there are not a lot of watch faces for this watch but give it time, it’s the newest one they have so there could be more coming in the future.  If I could give Amazon 4 stars, I would but I gave Fitbit only one star (wish I could give it only 1/2 of one) for not being able to run two watches simultaneously on one account. Great big mistake that needs to be fixed and fixed before they rolled the first Versa off of the assembly line.",1.0

Fitbit Versa Lite Edition Smart,"This is actually a replacement for a previous Versa Lite which gave up after a fairly long life. I get compliments for the color which is always nice. The one critical feature for me is that while your asleep it monitors your heart and you can request that it provides notification of irregular rhythm. For me that one feature is worth every penny. I tried a newer Fitbit but it only provided that check manually instead of automatically- which made it worthless to me.I was diagnosed recently with sleep apnea and this watch is invaluable to me since it gives me a pretty accurate summary each morning and the app rates my sleep quality and provides data for the amount of REM sleep that I got the previous night.When you set up the app you can designate whether the watch is on your dominant wrist and you can also change the sensitivity of the sleep program.On a different note- the first watch that was shipped wouldn't charge on my computer, they immediately shipped its replacement and it worked perfectly.The only trick was that I had to uninstall my previous watch from my phone app and then it detected my new watch and I was able to proceed with the installation.",5.0
Fitbit Versa Lite Edition Smart,"Initially, I loved this watch. I was given a Versa watch before this, but it fell apart; literally it came apart after a year and I'm not rough with watches at all. But, I really enjoyed it so I bought this one (Versa Lite) in August 2020. Sigh. It worked great. It was really doing a good job motivating me with my steps and fitness. Then a week ago, I made the fatal mistake of updating to the constantly suggested firmware. Before the update, my watch stayed charged at least 4 days, after the update it would need recharging every 12 hours. Then just a day ago it started only holding a charge for 2 hours or so. And now, today, my Fitbit just completely died. I'm really disappointed that after 5 months and $110, my Fitbit died. I can't bring myself to purchase another one even though I really love it because after a quick Google search, the reduced battery charge after completing firmware updates seems to have been an ongoing issue since at least 2016. But in my case, all they did was convince a guaranteed lifetime customer to seek a different product, which is very disheartening considering how much I really loved their Versa brand.UPDATE: I called Fitbit, they troubleshot my watch, confirmed I was still under warranty and gave me a choice of 50% off an upgraded watch or send another replacement of my current watch for free. I like my current watch, so I opted for that. If your watch is giving you problems or dies and it's been less than a year since you purchased it, call them and they will help you find the best solution. All of their watches in the U.S. have a one year warranty that they honor. Thank you Fitbit!",5.0

Apps load faster and the touch screen is more responsive.Always on display is now supported.Screen brightness is now always adaptive, though you can preset the base brightness.There is a new sleep mode which turns off autowake and notifications during during selected times so your watch doesn't bother you while you sleep. Do not disturb mode will silence calls and notifications during exercise as well.You can control the Spotify app on your phone from your watch.Fitbit pay is now standard on all Versa 2 editions.*The battery is rated for 5+ days. I've been getting a solid 6.5 with always connected, all day sync, 24 hour HR, and at least 3 hours of running.That being said, the Versa 2 isn't perfect. Fitbit OS is still feature lite, the app store is still rather small and there is still a dearth of useful clock faces. I'd still like to see a screen lock feature, a stride per minute counter and music controls in the exercise app, and a bunch of small. QoL improvements.If you're like me and mostly want an excellent fitness tracker with a handful of productivity features sprinkled on top, then the Versa 2 is for you, especially if you want a battery life long enough to make use of any of those things. If you care less about fitness and more about controlling your phone from your wrist, then you might want to look at a Galaxy Watch or a Fossil Gen 5, especially if you don't plan on tracking sleep, as you'll need to recharge both at the end of the day.

I use it mostly to track my vitals and workouts. But my ring camera also connects to it and shows me when someone is at my door. Only negative is that the battery doesn't last long--maybe a day and a half. However, it charges quickly and I just set it on the charger while I do my makeup and get ready for my morning and it's almost fully charged by then. Lots of clock face customization too.",5.0
Google Pixel Watch 2,"Item Purchased: Black Pre-Owned Google Pixel Watch 2The watch arrived in a resealed, open-box Google Pixel Watch 2 package. It included both watch band sizes and a USB-C charging cable, but no wall outlet—so if you don’t already have a USB-C wall charger, you may want to pick one up.The watch face was pristine and the device was very clean—overall, in excellent condition.Out of the box, the watch had a 34% charge and paired easily with my OnePlus phone. Even at that battery level, the battery saver mode held up well through a full 8-hour shift.Today, after a full charge, I used the watch mainly to track steps, check time, monitor health, and control media. I don’t get a lot of notifications or spend much time fiddling with it, and by the end of my 8-hour shift, the battery was still at 78%. So far, the battery health seems excellent.Overall, I’m really happy with the price and quality of this purchase—great value.",5.0
Google Pixel Watch 2,This watch is an upgrade from any Fitbit model in my opinion. I can easily access my contacts and create a message or call someone directly from my watch if I can't get to my phone. I find the step count more accurate than Fitbit while pushing a baby stroller.It charges using a magnetic charger via Type-C and charges within about an hour. The battery doesn't last as long as I'd like but it doesn't bother me unless I forget to charge my watch in the morning.It keeps track of my heart rate and monitors for any irregular signs.Very decent way for the value!,5.0
Google Pixel Watch 2,"So I quickly learned after getting the watch a few days ago to go into the watch's settings, click battery, and turn on the battery saver. To have your watch come on, you gently tap the screen or press the crown button. This has greatly improved the battery life. But YOU shouldn't have to do that with a watch that costs this much.On the plus side, you can change just about every setting imaginable, and the Fitbit is a nice touch (despite most of the good features behind a subscription service). That's called Google greed. You'll get used to it. They're a monopoly for a reason. Using it to make and receive calls is awesome. Got a call the other day and was able to talk as I washed the dishes. No earbuds are required. The person who called me said the audio was great.I highly recommend this if you don't mind the craptacular battery life. I'm surprised they didn't fix it with a software update. Something is feasting on the power. Or they went with the lowest bidder for parts.Oh, if you have fat fingers or medium-sized ones, forget about the keyboard. LOL. You'll need a stylus (yes they work). The speech-to-text is very good but you have to remember to say ""period"" or ""comma"" when composing messages. If you don't, it'll be one long sentence without proper punctuation. You can even say ""heart emoji"" and it'll insert that. You can also go back and edit the message with your fingers and use the keyboard to correct mistakes. I'll update my review if needed and the longer I use it. Oh, the ECG works and is very cool. Even the sleep monitor caught my apnea.",4.0
Google Pixel Watch 2,"I had to replace my aging Galaxy S3 Frontier which is at it's end of life. I love that watch! I was going to get either a Galaxy S6 Pro or a Pixel Watch 2. After much soul searching, I knew I had to make a decision. so the gambler in me decided to try something new.  I'm glad I did!Now clearly, a watch released less than 6 months ago is going to out perform one released 6 or 7 years ago. But  the improvement in performance is remarkable.It's faster responding, pairs quickly and easily with my Pixel 6a smartphone, and has superior software.It's really the software that makes the smartwatch useful and productive. And to Samsung's credit, they kept my old war horse's software current.  But, the Fitbit software is much more modern than Samsung Health. It can scan barcode label on food packages when I record what I eat and it is much more flexible in terms of how the nutrient servings list is recorded.  And that means less manual calculations when trying adjust servings from grams to, say, ounces.Heart monitoring is more accurate, stair climbing is much more accurate, and sleep monitoring is actually usable. It might be the advancements in sensor quality rather than the software algorithms. But I do trust the results more.Charging the battery is FAST.  I get about 36 hours of life from the battery, on about 45 minutes of charging. Twenty minutes of charging while I shower in the morning will give me about 12 hours of battery life.  The wireless magnetic charger is a little different from the Samsung watch, but it is very functional. The user needs to make sure that the crown and stem is parallel to the power cord, and once the watch is about an inch away from the charger, the charger is drawn to the watch magnetically and it leaps up and connects to the watch. This is not BS on my part, it happens everyday. Only once has this connection not been made perfectly.The PW 2, is smaller and lighter, physically.  It's about the size of a traditional men's mechanical dress watch. My ancient eyes can see the slightly smaller screen with ease.  My arthritic gorilla fingers akso have no problem manipulating the screen.  It is comfortable to wear long term, even to bed, for sleep monitoring.  It offers a more classy and elegant appearance than the larger and sportier S6 Pro.I was comfortable with the new user interface within a day or two; so I think people coming from another brand won't have a huge learning curve. Like the Pixel Smartphones, Google uses a simple and uncluttered interface that I found very intuitive.I am quite pleased with my purchase,and can recommend it to others.",5.0
Garmin Vívoactive 5,"I decided to order a Garmin Vivoactive 5 when my Fitbit Versa expired on me in Nov.2024.  It took a couple of weeks for it to arrive, mainly due to the holiday season, but it has been worth it.  The battery life on it is much longer than what I previously had on Fitbit, and there are a lot of features available.  It will take a while to familiarize yourself with so many features, but once you do they will be worth it.  If you use it to monitor your workouts, as I do, there are many categories of workouts that it will evaluate, running, walking, strength workouts, biking, cardio, etc.  You get great data on your sleep patterns, morning reports, weather updates, etc.  What I enjoy is that when you download the Garmin app on your phone you can use your data from Garmin to enter into competitions with other Garmin members.  Fitbit, once bought out by Google, began to eliminate a lot of the groups and competitions you could be involved in, so Garmin was a breath of fresh air in this.  The band on the watch feels great and the watch looks stylish.  I am sure that there are a ton more features out there that I have not even gotten to yet, but my impressions on a Garmin smartwatch is that they are definitely worth the money if you enjoy using a smartwatch daily.",5.0
Garmin Vívoactive 5,"I really like that you can turn the heart rate on or off, gps, on or off etc basically turning all emfs so you can wear it without those harmful effects and only turn them on when working out. The battery life works well and long. My husband and I have the same watch and wear it together. Occasionally his will say he ran a little further (for example mine will say I ran 1 mi while his will say .9 or 1.1) I have noticed the longer distances make the accuracy closer to the same. I love that you can customize the brightness and colors. We’ve set our face clock to more warm lighting so that even at night it isn’t too awful  bright and yet it’s still visible in the sun. I got the white and love the aesthetic. I also haven’t noticed it yellow or easily discolor. Feels great on and doesn’t rub while running. Doesn’t feel too heavy either. For what you get the price was right. I got mine on sale for about $200.",5.0
Garmin Vívoactive 5,"Fantastic fitness product. It reminds you to get up and move, counts your steps, tracks if you take naps, tracks regular sleep, measures your heart, syncs with your alarm outside of the Garmin program.... This is very efficient. Helps wake me up! Can see who's calling you, without checking your phone... Is a bonus. It even gives you positive affirmations in the morning. It helps with my depression recovery. I LOVE it. My first time trying such technology.",5.0
Garmin Vívoactive 5,"Four stars out of five - it does a lot of things very well, but lacks some features that I thought it had because of the description on the Garmin web page - most notable the inability to track respiration during workouts.  It does track respiration all day, so this must just be a software issue to get you to buy a more expensive version.  The watch faces are a little finicky to design, but there are a lot of them on the Connect IQ shop (some free, some not).I've worn an A brand watch that works seamlessly with my iPhone since they first came out.  I would say that that watch is an outstanding smart watch with a mediocre fitness tracker.  This Garmin Vivoactive 5 (they now have the 6 released) is an excellent fitness tracker with an average smart watch.  It pairs with the Garmin App and gives you much better granularity into your fitness metrics.  It has a solid battery life - my first test lasted six days before it went into low battery mode and I used it for about 12 hours of workouts (which is a battery drain).  The best feature for me is that it allows me to put all my workouts (including my cycling with a Garmin 1030)  into one location, Garmin Connect.Overall, it isn't a replacement for my smart watch, but it is a great entry level fitness tracker.  I'm planning on using it for several months to completely understand all the features, then I may try going for a high end Garmin watch as a replacement for my trusty A-watch.  For now, I am (ugh) wearing one watch on each arm.",4.0

The ability to see more details than a normal smartwatch has been a game changer for my running. Extremely simple and intuitive to use.

Garmin Forerunner 55,"I've had this watch for almost a month and its been fantastic. GPS and heart rate are accurate, display is sharp (albeit not AMOLED level crisp), and the stats are just what I need/want. The question for you is will this watch meet your needs, wants, and lifestyle?With the release of the Forerunner 165, it *seems* the 55 isn't a great choice. The 165 has an AMOLED display, an altimeter, and a few more bells and whistles for about 40 bucks more. The upgraded screen and altimeter make it seem like an easy choice to set down the extra 40 (or 100 for portable music). However, the 55 still offers a nice value and solid features:I've found the display on this watch to be fine (even with so-so near vision). Its already helped me knock time off my pace and train for an upcoming marathon. The data provided by the 55 is detailed:  the body battery, sleep data, VO2 max, fitness age, stress, running cadence, and more are probably a bit more than I want and encompass all that I need. I always run with my phone (as a Zombie's Run fan and need to be in-touch with the outside world) so having a music option or do-it-all watch isn't necessary.While I haven't pulled a formal training plan (I'm following the Zombie's, Run! marathon trainer which I've used before to good effect), I *could* pull a plan to my 55. Further, the 55 ""knows"" when I've gone hard on a run or had a bad night's sleep and recommends a rest day or lower effort run. All good stuff!TL:DR - the 55 is a great option for a beginner runner or experienced runner who wants some data but knows (or is honest with themselves) that they probably won't dive into too deep (e.g. pace, cadence, body battery, and sleep are all they want with a few more goodies). Its also a great choice for the person who wants a dedicated GPS watch but wears other watches during their day and is having trouble justifying a special purpose purchase.I'm still in the return window for my 55 and I'm going to keep it. The 40 dollar (+ tax) isn't a huge hurdle but I can't say that the 165 gives me enough more to turn in the 55. I'm very happy with this watch because *it meets all my needs an wants* if the same is true for  you, go ahead and order this but if you want the sharper display, a bit more data, and an altimeter (really, the only thing I miss on my 55) then save up some more and go that way.",4.0

Garmin Forerunner 55,"Best investment I’ve made on Amazon. The look, size, feel, and screen clarity are all amazing. I ran the Dallas BMW marathon with this watch and the functionality of knowing my mile pace and what my heart rate is while running was super important to me. When it comes to functionality, this watch is great for working out, tracking your steps, or viewing your heart rate/stress levels (especially at work).

The **battery life is excellent**, lasting up to two weeks, which is a huge plus compared to other smartwatches. However, it lacks some premium training features found in higher-end Garmin models, and the price is on the higher side. If you're looking for a stylish, health-focused smartwatch with solid functionality, this is a great choice!",5.0
Garmin Venu 3S Soft Gold,"I absolutely love my Garmin Venu 3S. It’s sleek, lightweight, and fits perfectly on smaller wrists, making it super comfortable to wear all day—and night. And you’ll want to wear it 24/7 because this watch is packed with features that actually make a difference in your daily life.One of my favorite things is the sleep tracking. It doesn’t just tell you how long you slept—it breaks down your sleep stages and gives you personalized tips to improve your rest. Add in the Body Battery feature, and you’ve got a pretty awesome way to keep tabs on how much energy you really have throughout the day.The Venu 3S also comes with a built-in speaker and mic, so you can take calls or use your voice assistant right from your wrist. The AMOLED screen is super crisp and colorful, and the touchscreen is easy to navigate whether you’re checking notifications, starting a workout, or queuing up a guided meditation.Speaking of workouts, there are tons of options—yoga, strength training (it counts your reps!), running, biking, you name it. It also has great wellness features like stress tracking, nap detection, women’s health tracking, and even an ECG app.Battery life is amazing too—I only need to charge it about once a week.If you’re looking for a smartwatch that keeps up with your life and helps you stay on top of your health, the Garmin Venu 3S is seriously hard to beat!",5.0
Garmin Venu 3S Soft Gold,Why did you pick this product vs others?:Amazing watch! We previously both had Apple Watches and wanted something more sleek that also tracked our fitness activities better.  We are avid fitness goers and are very pleased with the fitness tracking and features of these watches. I wish we would have made the switch sooner. I run a lot and the insights this watch gives you are top notch. The body battery and sleep insights are also extremely helpful and seem very accurate. The Venu has been game changing for our health because now we have more data to better understand how our bodies are functioning!We didn’t like how our Apple Watches were constantly notifying us of every little thing and that is not the case with these. The notifications are perfect!,5.0

Garmin Venu 3S Soft Gold,"I got the Garmin Vesu 3s to replace an apple watch to track heart rate after I noticed my apple watch showing out of the norm readings only a year after purchasing. I  never would use a watch for medical advice, but it is nice to be able to note my basic heart rate for my chronic illness. I was advised to try the Garmin because it was built more for athletes and I chose the Vesu 3s because it can do an ECG. I am happy to report that I do like it better than an apple watch! It is slightly larger than the apple watch, which I don't prefer, and the band isn't as nice as the apple watch either, but the watch is more superior in my opinion. I like that the watch face can be customized more than the apple watch and so far it has been pretty spot on with my heart rate (I cross check its data with other methods of tracking heart rate to get a good idea). I am OBSESSED with the fact that it stays charged for so much longer and I can wear it to sleep. Don't love the charging as much. I wish it had a pad it could sit on to charge like an apple watch. It also has a whole host of other health functions to use as well. They give you a USB-C charger and I had to buy a specific converter for it; the chord also isn't long enough and finding a replacement that is longer is something you have to go search for. However, the charging function is simple and fast and works well. Overall, I can't complain about some of functions, I am only relieved that it is completely functional and seems to be living up to its quality so far!",4.0
Garmin Venu 3S Soft Gold,"Beautiful watch. I’ve yet to see how it functions over time as I’ve only had it for about a week but I love everything about it. The main app is super customizable and easy to follow. I’m able to track everything I need plus a ton of extra options for more advanced runners. The battery has lasted the entire week I’ve only charged it once. No complaints other than it’s a very delicate watch, make sure to get a screen protector or you will have scruffs on it right away. I’m an active person but nothing crazy and I already have scuffs after one week so I ordered a protector. The accuracy is insane! If you’re on the fence about this or another brand, I’d highly suggest trying this out. Will never go back to the Apple Watch after switching to garmin!",5.0

I wore it in the ocean and pools, completely waterproof. The fit is about the same as a 40mm Apple Watch and the weight is similar too. The band would be make with better quality and I love the color. I’ve worn for my workouts and the fitness tracker is great! Still getting the hang of it but so far good. Overall I definitely recommend and good value for your money.",4.0
Garmin Instinct 2,"I’ve had smart watches I was issued through the military before so that’s nothing new to me. This is therefore a more I formed review. When I got this watch I was pleasantly surprised by ease of use with respect to swapping through the menus and selecting what you need. Does take some time perhaps to memorize where to go for each item but that is to be expected. I mostly wanted this for the GPS with outdoor activity and the heart rate and fitness features. (Fitbit only ever broke after 3 months, that is to say stopped working out of the blue). The compass is on point and the heart rate monitor is spot on as well. One of the coolest things about this is that it connects to an app and you can look for even better watch faces that have exactly what you want to see on them instead of just the default, that’s the kind of support GARMIN gives with this. I got the watch face that displays heart rate, so I don’t have to swap through menus or use the app to see it in real time. The fit is great and the battery life is as well. You should be aware that some features use up more battery than others, such as active GPS etc, so if you use that you can expect the battery to drain a little bit more quickly. The only adjustment I needed to make was the charging cable, I needed to pinch the lip of the plug with needle nose pliers ever so GENTLY just to adjust them the tiniest amount so it seated properly in the watch which is one of the pictures. I am very happy with this purchase!",5.0
Garmin Instinct 2,"I don't write a lot of reviews, but I thought I'd chime in about this. (Just a regular old customer here--no connection to Garmin or Amazon.) My point of view might be uncommon for Garmin owners: I actually don't think of myself as a Smartwatch guy and have actually turned down free Apple Watches (as holiday gifts) on two occasions. No interest in texting on my wrist. I'm a ""watch guy"" in the more traditional sense--a big fan of mid-tier to high-end mechanical watches. But I wanted one techy watch for when I bike and work out and for a long backcountry hike where GPS was going to be necessary. I've owned this watch for a couple months now and have put it through its paces: swimming (it's highly water-resistant), biking, lifting, and (as mentioned) in the wilderness. It hasn't disappointed.Set up is easy and intuitive: if you can handle using an iPhone, you should have no problem making your way through the process. Downloading the smartphone app on your device and syncing it is worth the trouble, in my opinion. Among other things, it will allow you to keep on top of software updates, control your music while working out (without having to touch your phone), and get whatever alerts (like texts or Ring notifications) you might want to opt into. I have it set up so that the Garmin app only seeks out my watch when I open the app---don't want this thing constantly searching and draining my phone battery when I'm not even wearing the watch.I do still fumble through the different buttons trying to remember what does what, but it is getting better. I usually only wear this for a few hours at a time a few days a week; if I wore it more regularly, I'm sure I would be far more fluent by now. And the good news is, you really can't mess anything up by pressing the wrong button.There's tons of customization that you can do (during setup or just whenever) to rearrange the main screen, add or remove activities and options, etc. For an entry-level smartwatch, it's impressively featured!Battery life is utterly insane. I charged it before a 10-hour hike where the GPS was going the entire time--that was in early May. Since then I've worn it several times for many collective hours, sometimes in GPS mode, sometimes not, and I only had to charge it again today--in mid June. Granted, I power it down whenever I'm not using it, but still, you get a lot of time out of a single charge. I have the solar version, and I suppose that extends the battery life in a limited way---can't say I've tested that or noticed strong evidence of it, but I'll take Garmin's word for it.The GPS tracking feature works very well once you get it dialed in to your preferences, which isn't tricky to do. If you get lost, you can flip to the screen where your track is: it's just a squiggly line on the screen---there's no map background on this plain-Jane, smaller, black and white display---but with pretty minimal brainpower, you can use it to retrace your steps, no problem. No chance of getting lost with this thing on, as long as you've got a signal---and I've never had any trouble acquiring one. Beyond that, just having it on your wrist as a trip computer, tracking how long you've been at it, how many miles you've covered, your elevation, etc, is really nice. It allowed me to provide very specific answers every time my kid asked ""how many more miles do we have to go?"" Note, though, that you'll need to activate the GPS mode when you start your hike (or ride or whatever). And you'll want to shut if off when you're done in order to extend the battery life.Nice to have the heart-rate and pulse oximeter features. Also reassuring to have the ""incident reporting"" feature, or whatever it's called. Thankfully haven't had to use it, but I've read positive customer reviews from folks who have. It's a comfort to know that my wife will get an instant alert on her phone if I crash my bike, for example. And I believe the alert will include my exact location.As for the watchy-watch stuff: this thing is very well built. It feels robust, but is as light as a feather. I mean, you can really forget you have it on, especially if you're accustomed to wearing a luxury sports watch that weighs more than 100g. I haven't tried swapping out the rubber strap, but I see no reason why you couldn't put it on a NATO or something if you wanted to. The integrated strap itself feels like it's good quality, though I imagine it will eventually need to be replaced after a few years of putting it on and taking it off.The overall look is very rugged and ""tactical."" At least with the black model, there's nothing refined or luxurious about it at all.The main thing I want to say about it as a watch per se is that the size is perfect, at least for me. A lot of these smartwatches nowadays are enormous: 45mm and super-thick. To me they look absurd. This one is about 40mm, which is by no means small, but it's sensible and while definitely ""sized"" for a man, could work well as an oversized unisex option. Point is, when I'm wearing it, it just feels like a normal watch, proportioned like several of my other, mechanical watches---not like a giant wrist computer. It calls no attention to itself. The screen isn't tiny or anything: the display is plenty readable. It's not touchscreen, it's not full color, you can't watch videos on it---if you want all of that, look at a different model. This is one of those ""everything you need, nothing you don't"" items. (Though, again, it has a pretty surprising array and number of features---most of which I've never used.)Big fan.",5.0
Garmin Instinct 2,"Great product. This product is VERY durable. It can track almost anything you can think of. Perfect for running, hiking, and working out. You can receive and read notifications as long as your phone is connected. You cannot talk through the watch for a phone call, but you can accept the call. The charging speed is insanely fast. Once I forgot to charge the watch, plugged it in for 20 minutes and it lasted me 8+ hours. All you have to do is charge it for one night and it will last you for a week. Good value for money. 5/5 would definitely recommend for all athletes.",5.0
Garmin Instinct 2X Solar,"I've been using the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar in Graphite for a while now, and it's been an outstanding experience. This rugged GPS smartwatch has not only met but exceeded my expectations with its solar charging capability, built-in flashlight, and multi-band GNSS support.The solar charging feature is a game-changer. It significantly extends the battery life, ensuring that I rarely have to worry about charging the watch manually. This is incredibly convenient, especially during long hiking trips or outdoor activities where access to power sources is limited. The watch face is designed to maximize exposure to sunlight, efficiently converting it to energy and keeping the watch powered for days on end.Durability is a hallmark of the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar. Its rugged build can withstand all kinds of rough treatment, from bumps and drops to extreme weather conditions. I've used it in heavy rain, on dusty trails, and under the scorching sun, and it has performed flawlessly in every scenario. The graphite color not only looks sleek but also masks dirt and wear, keeping the watch looking new.The built-in flashlight has proven to be more useful than I initially thought. It's powerful enough to guide me through dark paths during night treks and convenient when I need to find something in my backpack after dusk. This feature adds an extra layer of utility, making the watch an indispensable tool for any adventure.As for navigation, the multi-band GNSS support ensures accurate location tracking in even the most challenging environments. Whether I'm in a deep valley, near tall buildings, or under thick canopy, the Garmin Instinct 2X Solar maintains a precise signal, giving me confidence in my location and route.The user interface is intuitive, and syncing with my smartphone is seamless, providing me with notifications, weather updates, and other essential information. The range of activity tracking features is impressive, from standard fitness metrics to specialized outdoor activities, all accurately monitored and recorded.The Garmin Instinct 2X Solar is a top-tier smartwatch that stands out for its solar charging, durability, and precise navigation. It's the perfect companion for anyone who loves the outdoors or needs a reliable timepiece that can handle the rigors of adventure. I highly recommend it to those seeking a rugged, feature-rich smartwatch that won’t let you down.",5.0
Garmin Instinct 2X Solar,"This is the perfect activity watch/smartwatch for me. It can’t call or text from the watch itself, but those are features I rarely used on my Apple Watch anyway. It’ll still show you if you have a text, call, or any other notification but is geared toward being more of a great activity watch than a phone on your wrist.What’s great about this is how jam-packed with features it is. They took a ton of stuff that previously was only available in the fenix and epix watches and brought it to this instinct 2x solar. It has sleep tracking, activity tracking (with customizable screens for each activity), training readiness, heart rate, vo2 max, blood oxygen level, etc.  Most apps charge money for the amount of detail this watch and app give you about your day to day and activities, but there’s no subscription on this. It’s all freeAnd it constantly checks heart rate. My old Apple Watch would check periodically but you could never glance down and see what the current hr was without tapping on the icon and waiting. With this watch it constantly is reading heart rate and keeps a graph showing the history (which you can have show on the watch face if you want).The battery is awesome, something like 40 days with how I have mine set up. And the solar charging actually works. I’ve heard that past versions it didn’t help all too much, but this one it really makes a difference. I added 2 days to my battery life from just a few hours in direct sunlight.The only places where this watch is lesser are the display and the navigation. If detailed maps and touch screen/oled screen are important to you, then go with the fenix or epix models. The navigation on this watch can be useful as it includes the trackback feature where it’ll guide you back on the path you came in on, line-of-sight tracking (keeps you on path if you have to go like down in a valley or around an obstacle where you might lose sense of direction), and you can even pre-load courses to follow later. However, it’s a pretty bare-bones navigation map. It has a pointer for your watch and a line showing the path and that’s about it. The epix and fenix watches have nicer displays, color, touchscreen, and more detailed maps which help a lot with navigation but you also sacrifice a significant amount of battery life for those features. And they’re double the price of this one.All in all, I think this is the perfect middle point for a watch. It has all the features from the top of the line ones that I need, along with crazy battery life and a decent price. If you don’t need detailed navigation but want great gps and activity tracking at half the cost of some of those other watches, this is a great option.",5.0
Garmin Instinct 2X Solar,"I got it 100 days ago and have only charged it 5 times. I've used the GPS and activity tracking for about 125 hours, and ran over 135 miles, including 2 spartan races. The band is very durable and lets me tighten it as much as needed to keep most mud out, though the mud during one race did prevent it from tracking my HR properly for about 10 minutes. The watch itself is also durable, and it's activity tracking is as accurate most other Garmin trackers I've used. The GPS is fairly accurate though it does leave the trail by about 3 meters in the foliage (though you can make it more accurate if you want). The solar panel works very well and the battery lasts far longer than I need. The first charge lasted 32 days (charging at 10-20% battery). In total, in 100 days, I've worn it for all but 10 or so hours (while charging it). The torch is very nice too, though I use it very sparingly as it can rapidly drain the battery. I've found no fault with the watch so far in any activity including swimming, running, biking, HR broadcasting, or cardio (though some activities don't track properly on instinct series watches such as jumping rope). All in all, it's a great buy.",5.0
Garmin Epix Pro,"As a long time Garmin user I must say this Epix 51mm is amazing. I've owned the Fenix 3HR, 6X and 7X. All were fantastic watches in their own ways. I always wanted the 51mm size in AMOLED, and now the Epix offers that.  The battery life is simply amazing and in smart watch mode, I get longer life than my 7X. The screen is AMAZING much like an Apple Watch or Samsung watch.  This is NOT a smart watch in the sense of Apple or Samsung. This is a fitness/outdoor watch. You're not going to make phone calls, watch videos etc on this watch. This is geared for folks who value health metrics. Overall, I'd say this watch is the best Garmin has to offer.  The new HR appears better than the older generation. It's able to lock on and read HR during strength training workouts. The older models struggled in that area like most wrist based HRM. Steady state cardio workouts, the HRM is spot on! It's an expensive watch, but worth every penny in my opinion. The maps are absolutely detailed and MUCH easier to read when compared to a MIP display offered in the Fenix series.",5.0
Garmin Epix Pro,"I struggled with buying this watch because of the cost but ultimately I couldn't help myself.  I am so glad I did.  I've never owned a watch that is so useful beyond telling time.  The flashlight.  The weather.  Sleep patterns.  Heart rate.  Step counting.  GPS.  Compass.  Plus much more.  Admittedly there's a learning curve to using all the features but once you get the hang of it,there's a logic to accessing and editing features.The battery life on the 51 is phenomenal.  I have a Casio ProTrek and that requires a daily charge .  The Garmin will go for almost 2 weeks between charges, depending on the features you actively use.Obviously it's a handsome watch and so far the titanium watch and sapphire glass has held up with no scratches.  I like being able to customize the watch faces too to reflect different data fields or just more appealing face/colors.I highly recommend the watch if you're comfortable spending such a large amount.It's also the most comfortable watch I've ever worn.",5.0
Garmin Epix Pro,"I was holding onto my Garmin Fenix 5X waiting for a watch with enough new features to justify upgrading.  I skipped the Fenix 6 and watched as the Fenix 7 came along.  With the new AMOLED display in the Epic thought maybe this would be the time.The clincher for me was moving to a job where I could wear the watch all day, plus the recent price drop for the holidays.I opted for the Epix Pro Sapphire 51mm due to the larger batter and extended life.  I have a large enough wrist that the smaller watches seem too dainty, anyway.The watch features are amazing.  The addition of blood oxygen monitoring alone has been worth the price of admission.  I am able to get much better insight into my sleep quality and struggles with obstructive sleep apnea.The EEG is also an amazing capability to have on your wrist.I’ve noticed the processor response times are faster than my older 5X.I’ve yet to use some of the features like onboard music and Garmin pay.Just an amazing and gorgeous watch.",5.0
Garmin Epix Pro,"Really an amazing piece of machinery. Huge battery, built in flashlight (that I use pretty regularly), tons of info and even apps at your fingertips.Two things it does NOT have: 1. microphone / speaker: you cannot make or receive phone calls, and it cannot make any sound. This is due to the fact that it is really waterproof down to 50 meters or something like that, so it can't have any open ports like a speaker or mic.2. it will NOT measure your VO2max, unless you run at 70% of your max heart rate for 10 minutes. I'm too big and old to run like that, so it doesn't measure my VO2max. A bit of a disappointment since my earlier fitbit would do that.I really do love it and plan to keep it, but also it is a bit of ""power tool"" for fitness enthusiasts and doesn't do a couple of the more common smartwatch features that you might expect.",5.0
Garmin Epix Pro,"This is my 4th Garmin watch. I bought this watch to upgrade from my Phoenix 6  So far has been a great experience , the upgrades that this watch has over the Phoenix are very noticeable.

Garmin Venu Sq 2,This watch/fitness tracker is working very good. It tracks outdoor exercise via GPS very accurately. There are several functions more than what i plan to use. I have personalized the face and can switch easily between the personalized and standard faces. Battery life is amazing and quick to recharge when needed. The band was ok but didn't fit my wrist as i wanted so got these (B0DF2L935T) set of 3 stretch bands. they fit perfectly and are adjustable. dry quickly if they get wet (shower). Face is very easy to read in all light. you can set quiet hours and the watchface does not automatically come on if you move in your sleep. can still quickly access the face with the bottom button. Highly recommend,5.0

I am a distance runner, and honestly this watch has been my best investment so far. The battery life is so long, allowing me to go days without charging it, and when I do need to charge it, it charges very quickly. It’s very easy to use and has a lot of helpful functions. I love being able to customize my watch face as well to match what I’m wearing. Matched with the garmin app, this watch is perfect for anyone who wants to have a watch with both functionality and good design. It’s also very durable, as I’ve dropped it so many times and bumped it into many things and it still stands strong.",5.0
Garmin Venu Sq 2,"this watch is definitely my favorite. HR and GPS are predictably strong. But age is unkind to the battery.I love this watch. I've tested the heart rate against other machines a dozen times, it's never more than a couple beats difference. The GPS is good enough, occasionally vulnerable to super heavy weather. That said, it succeeded in tracking most of my movement skiing in a blizzard, so not bad!But here's the thing: two years old, the battery life is down to 6 days with no exercise. Every hour of activity tracking takes away a full day of battery life. I thought I could do a weekend on Manhattan without my charger, but it tracked every walk around town, and the battery died in 1.5 days.  (BTW it spontaneously tracked 6 of my 11 miles walking around town)Music function with Bluetooth is pretty good, sometimes broken. Between my left wrist and right ear, that's disappointing. But usually good enough to keep my rhythm on a 3-mile jog.I haven't found a better watch for these functions, but perfection would be great.",4.0

Garmin Venu Sq 2,This watch is everything I wanted it to be! I’ve had an Apple Watch for years but the battery on them never lasted for more than a day and that drove me crazy! But this Garmin will generally stay charged for a week or a little more depending on what all I’m doing that week. Meaning I don’t have to take my charging cord on every trip I take as long as I charge it before we leave.I have an iPhone and haven’t had any issues syncing it with my phone and the apps I want to use it with. I can’t answer a text/message from the watch but it does let you preview messages that come in. Which is a fact I knew going in and I was perfectly okay with that. But if you’re wanting to be able to perform all the functions your phone will do from your watch this isn’t the one for you.It’s the perfect size for my wrist. The wrist bands are easy enough to change out with lots of options on Amazon.,5.0

Easy to use and battery life is good. I charge mine a lot, usually in the car cause I’m not moving at that point. I like to keep a good charge so I don’t have it die mid run. Love it.

Garmin Forerunner 265,"What you have on your wrist is a phenomenal computer with 100's of thousands of man hours in the writing of code and algorithms to take all the data from the sensors and turn it into a comprehensive health guide for physical fitness.  And Garmin, along wth Polar and Apple and Suunto and all the other lesser known brands, have barely scratched the surface of the possibilities to harness computing power on your wrist.  They haven't even begun to tie in AI to take the data and give you your own personal narrative for how to optimize your health and fitness.  One could write a book on all the potential for this technology in this field.But as to the implementation...The menus need some work...Garmin Connect, where one can build an app and upload it to the watch to run weight lifting routines or HIIT exercises needs a very lot of work.  It works but it's crude and basic.  For instance, if you want to track HRR [Heart Rate Recovery] after an excercise you have to remember to hit stop immediately, hit the lower right button to gain access to a set of options and then scroll to track HRR over the next two minutes.  All the while you are losing heart beats to count.  Really?  Why isn't that option in the GC app maker so you can add it to the app you are building?  And why, when you do a repetitive set that has work-rest and you repeat that x number of times do they insist on ending with a rest period.  The last period should be a work period.  And why can't the tie their lame audio beeps to your phone where you can customize the sounds you want to hear when doing a HIIT routine, eg?But, for all my grousing, I love being able to track my sleep and quality of sleep, my HR, HRV, time to recover, quality of the workout, time in HR Zones, Anaerobic and Aerobic quality, Body Battery, Stress, Intensity minutes, Training Status, Training Readiness, etc.  Too many things to mention.  And I've just scratched the surface in learning how to use it over these last 5 months.  I'm really excited about how they will integrate AI into this journey.  I would love to have an AI bundled with the watch that I could talk to through my phone.  Or have the Garmin Forerunner 256 be able to talk to me through Bluetooth to ear buds.",5.0

The stats are better, the screen is easier to read than the transflective one of the 235, and it's just as reliable. The workout options are more varied and customizable. It looks great, and I like the strap better than the 235.The heart rate and pulse ox tracking seem very accurate, when comparing to trustworthy dedicated devices.The sleep tracking has been very helpful as well. I don't believe any fitness watch is great at delineating when you're in REM versus deep sleep, etc. But it's a very useful overview.

Garmin Forerunner 965,"I've been a Garmin fan for 5+ years. I wore my previous forerunner 24/7 and loved it.

The battery lasts a good week plus (I kind of loose track at that point). The running features are really top notch, from tracking, stats while running, race planning, etc. The body battery feature is really cool and so far has been pretty spot on for how well I sleep and how much energy I'll have. The nap feature is also neat, despite my only taking the occasional nap.The touchscreen is very responsive and a nice upgrade from my previous Garmin. I also like the touchscreen disables during workouts so I don't accidently mess with settings.

The functionality and battery life are fantastic and are a real help to me when planning my activities. I like that the watch turns on when you raise it toward your gaze, works well, and that at night the screen is dimmed and simplified. My only longer term question is with the charging connection, this has not evolved from prior generations, and I have found this to be the weak part of the design - sometimes the connections get dirty or the cable breaks and charging can be a pain - wireless charging would be an improvement.",5.0

The Garmins were great when they were new but technology is moving fast and they don’t offer nearly what’s available now. The Fenix 8 is great in every way so far, it’s like a personal assistant you wear on your wrist. So many things that you’re able to do with this which is too numerous to mention. For that I’d refer you to the Garmin web site. Great watch and I have no qualms about the price. You have to buy one to experience what I’m saying. For now, I give it a 10 out of the 5 stars.

Garmin Fēnix 8,"I had the fenix 3 and loved it, but the screen was impossible to read most of the time.  This was a major problem for me and probably most users.  I then switched to a apple watch.  I really liked the easy of use, but felt that the tracking of activities was not that detailed and the battery life completely sucked.  I purched my second apple watch and had it just over a  year and went swimming with it.  It asked to track and open water swim and I said yes.  It then died from getting wet.  At that point, I was done with apple and was looking for something that was more dependable and had a long battery life.  Every did a ton of research and found that most of watches work well, but almost none have all the features I was looking for (long battery life, looks good, bright display, customized watch face, detailed tracking of activities, durable, water proof and compatible with IOS.  There were few that did all of these and found that I really liked the look of the fenix 8 AMOLED.  I have had it about 3 weeks and love it.  There is a little bit of a learning curve with the menu and trying to find were some of the things are.  Also depending on the activities, depends on what you need to do.  Like with lifting, it will track weight, reps and set you do.  Which is really nice.  Also, with some of the activities it will track your actual movement on a map.  I did softball and did not hit that well, so it showed most of my movement from home to first.  Golf is also nice, because you can track your score, Get distance to pin, a map of the hole/hazards and if you get the subscription you can play virtual rounds.  I also found that the garmin gps was more accurate then the course gps.  Battery life is so nice and the watch looks great too.  With the always on feature and tracking everything, I get around 11-15 days between each charge.  IWatch I would have to charge mid day to handle a full day of activities.  With the Garmin, it will also track my sleep/rest whic is something that I did not get because of battery life with the IWatch.  Again, if you never had a Garmin, you will need to learn the menu system and how it tracks, but they have done a great job with this one.  Over all extremely happy with it and would recommend it to others.  My only complaint is the price, but looking at the other watches out there with similar technology, this one is about 2-3 hundred more, but looks way better, is more rugged and way better support and community.",5.0

Garmin Fēnix 8,"I really wanted this watch to be the one that finally helped me move away from the Polar strap I’ve been using for years.Overall this is a beautiful watch.  Once you learn all the buttons and functions, it’s truly amazing.  That being said, I seriously question its accuracy…especially for $12001.  It consistently says my resting heart rate is in the 90s.  Occasionally it would show 70s which is a significant difference.  My OH1 strap usually has me in the 60s2.  Sleep score and stage measurements are off.  My typical sleep pattern almost always has me waking up in the middle of the night and up for about an hour before I fall back asleep again.  The “awake” measure was NEVER accurate.  For example:  I was up last night for ~40 min and it shows I was awake for 17 min. This makes me question whether or not it’s accurately measuring the other stages.Otherwise, the watch is beautiful and was a tough thing to give up.

Battery lasts almost a week, which is a big plus compared to other smart watches. If you are a normal working dude who wants a high functioning tough watch this one is for you. I have probably a dozen friends who have switched to the instinct over the years.",5.0
Garmin Vívosmart 5,"Got a Fenix 5x that I've used daily for years, but was getting tired of such a large item on my wrist. So i got this one. Liked it enough that I got another one for wife. Basic, easy to use for tracking things, comfortable enough to wear while sleeping. Battery length leaves something to be desired; maybe 4-5 days with pulse Ox on for sleep time only. Not a big deal, really. Take the time to calibrate steps, at least. And also invest in a screen protector. Being polycarbonate it'll scratch up sooner or later. Might as well take care of it. Happy with the purchase.",5.0
Garmin Vívosmart 5,"Was always an avid Fitbit 5 user but the quality of Fitbit has declined. I have gone through two in the past two years. So far the positives on the Vivosmart 5 (cost comparable) are the all-in-one protective band, sleek design (a little bit narrower than the Fitbit 5). The functions are impressive, accurate and limitless but not simple to use. Initial set-up is a breeze, step by step on the band and app but there are no instructions after that so plan on spending some time getting to know your Vivosmart 5, don’t get frustrated it may take 4 or 5 days but once you figure it out your going to love it, I do. Some functions will not appear for a couple of days as data must be gathered to generate results. Biggest draw back is no found logging. They work in conjunction with My Fitness Pal, which wants you to pay premium to use almost any of their features, yuck and the syncing between the two is not great, so there is never a accurate breakdown of calories in/out without bouncing back and forth between the apps. Fitbit 5 wins over Vivosmart 5 for food logging. Very happy with the purchase and excited to put my Vivosmart 5 to the test!",5.0
Garmin Vívosmart 5,"Do not buy this watch if you want to track the steps you are walking.  This watch will only track your steps if your arm is swinging.  If you are pushing a a mower or a cart, it will not record your steps.  If you are carrying something, like lumber or building materials, no step tracking.  In the last two days of yard work my old Fitbit would have recorded over 20,000 steps.  The Garmin recorded 6500.  The Garmin uses GPS so it should be tracking this movement but support just says it does not do this tracking.In the evening I have been woken by a very bright red light from the watch.  This is from the bottom of the watch against the skin.  It will flash this bright light 2 or 3 times at irregular intervals.  If I move my wrist, it will go off for a while.  So I guess I need to stay up to move all night to move the watch.  There is nothing in support or help to indicate what this function is or how to change it.I will be returning the watch and already have my old Fitbit back on.  I cannot recommend this watch!",1.0
Garmin Vívosmart 5,"Overall this one is a good one for those who don’t want to spend any more money than necessary, but want heart rate and not just pedometer functions. Battery life is a week or more unless you have features like full time pulse ox or other power hungry features turned on.The main issue with it is that the sleep tracking is more limited and less reliable than the next model up (vivoactive 5) and there are currently some problems with the “body battery” feature unless they can fix the firmware.In particular, it doesn’t do “nap tracking” but then again the nap tracking even on more expensive models is currently rather inaccurate with things like sitting in a recliner reading while awake being detected as a “nap”.Basically this is the model you want if you just need the essential features of a fitness/health tracker, don’t want to be paying for subscriptions, and don’t need stuff like ConnectIQ apps (most of which aren’t that useful). It does almost all of the “built in” stuff the more expensive watches have “built in” to the firmware.And the iPhone app is good quality and actually works, syncs reliably, etc, even with Apple not being helpful since they want you to buy their bloated extremely short battery life watches.",4.0
Garmin Vívosmart 5,My husband and I are both loving these watches. White was on backorder so we ordered mine through posh market. I love what it tracks and the simplicity of the use.

Price point wise we both paid around the same and I think it’s a fair price when compared to competitors.,5.0

Garmin Epix Gen 2,"I've owned several Garmin watches over the last few years, starting with the  The main reason that I purchased this watch, starting with the first Instinct, and then up to the Fenix 6.  They all had impressive battery life and ruggedness that the Samsung and Iwatch don't. As my eyes age though, the screen on the other Garmin watches was difficult to read in low light, and you had to push a button to use the backlight.  The Epix fixes all that for me.  The large OLED screen is bright enough to see in any light, and with a flick of the wrist, the screen wakes up.  Though the touchscreen works well, old habits die hard and I tend to use the physical buttons more than the screen. They work exactly the same as the Fenix. The usual suite of Garmin software and apps makes it a useful ecosystem to be in.  The fitness tracking appears to be accurate, and while the sleep tracking may not be, it does seem consistent for me at least.  I don't generally use the built-in mapping, because I usually have my phone and it drains the battery quickly, but the times I have used it, the maps look great and track properly. There are tons of watch faces to help customize as well.  The bands are the same as the Fenix watches (not sure about the 8) so there are plenty of replacements on Amazon.  And they are the easiest bands to change out as well.  The battery is usually about 2 weeks at most, which is sufficient for me; it charges quickly and though it's not a month, it will do.  The one complaint I would have is the charger itself.  I dislike proprietary chargers, only in that I have to have an extra cable in my bag that already has plenty of extra cables. This is one watch that I think I'll use for quite some time.",5.0
Garmin Epix Gen 2,"I had a Fenix and sold it to purchase an Apple Watch Ultra which I still have and enjoy using. However, while the AWU is a great smartwatch and has far better interaction, notification and connection to other Apple devices the AWU has horrendous batter life and it's fitness tracking is not as good as Garmin. Both watches have their place and I'll keep the AWU as it does have it's place.Regarding the Epix G2, the amoled screen is excellent, bright vibrant color, works well enough in direct sun and still, even with AOD enabled allows for multi-week battery. Compared to a day and a half on the AWU this is amazing. Workout tracking, step tracking and mapping are great and work as well as the AWU. Also I prefer that the Epix is round, watches should be round. Once the weather gets better I am looking forward to comparing the Epix G2 to my Garmin Edge 1000, if the EG2 works well enough as a cycling computer I'll likely sell the Edge as I don't need two cycling computers.Overall I'm very happy with the watch, it does many things excellent, some things good. If there way interaction with notifications, like an Apple Watch then it would be the perfect device, alas Apple will never allow that.",5.0

The quality is great and made top notch. This watch is $200 less than the previous model, but no shortcuts were taken. How can you beat a better watch for less money!? So the price is spot on! There are so many great features on this watch to help me get through a 5k race or a 50 mile ultra adventure. It connected straight to my phone via the Garmin app, and it connected quick! The watch weighs just enough to know you have a beast on your wrist, but not enough to slow you down. 10 out of 10!",5.0
Garmin Enduro 3,"The Garmin Enduro is a significant upgrade from the Fenix 6 Sapphire. The primary issue I had with the Fenix was its limited battery life, which the Enduro addresses remarkably well. I can now enjoy nearly 3 weeks of consistent heavy usage, compared to the 3 days I had with the Fenix 6S. This improvement eliminates the frustration of starting a workout only to find my watch running low on juice.The Enduro 3 also introduces several new features that enhance the user experience. Training Readiness and Endurance Score, both absent from the Fenix 6, are particularly useful for me. I can now assess my training readiness and plan my workouts accordingly, or opt for a rest day if the analytics tell me that a rest day would be more beneficial. Additionally, the sleep tracking on the Enduro 3 seems more refined and accurate.Despite its larger size (10mm more), I find the Enduro 3 lighter than my old Fenix. However, I don’t mind the extra bulk since it offers more features and improves the solar charging capability over the Garmin watches with smaller faces. A notable difference to the Fenix 8 (which I looked at closely before choosing the Enduro) is that the  Enduro 3 lacks voice features. But, as currently implemented, I consider the voice feature a gimmick that I would rarely use. I would only consider voice functionality if Garmin integrated a cellular connection and call-making capabilities, but that hasn’t been announced for the Fenix line.  Hopefully, that is something they are considering adding since I’d like to do workouts near my home without dragging along my cell phone.Overall, I am thoroughly satisfied with the latest version of the Enduro by Garmin. While it may be larger, its lightweight design and exceptional battery life make it an ideal choice for my need of a no-frills fitness tracker with remarkable battery life. If you’re looking for something like that, I highly recommend the Enduro 3.",5.0
Garmin Enduro 3,"I've had a Fenix 3, a Fenix 5, a Bulova Precisionist, a Citizen Eco-Drive, a high-end ProTrek, and two Apple Watches in the last several years.  In a way, the Apple Watches were way ahead of everyone else, in that they can do EVERYTHING.  At the same time, though, the Apples were a little fragile, and are tightly tethered to being recharged.  The Eco-Drive and the ProTrek had the advantage of solar power, which allows them to keep going when the power is out for extended periods, including cataclysms of various sorts, but they didn't do very many things, including no heart rate.I don't remember now why I sold the Fenix 5, but I remember being impressed with its durable construction, its multiplied resources for exercise and outdoor use, plus amazing battery life.  Garmin has been working on solar power for several years, now, and the new Enduro 3 maximizes battery life plus it has the same software and capabilities of the Fenix 8--with the exception of a MIP screen instead of AMOLED, no speaker or microphone, and no diving capabilities (though it is waterproof to 10 ATM).  Some reviewers say the Enduro 3 is the best watch Garmin has ever made.I encourage you to check the specs on the Enduro 3.  It really is quite remarkable.  It's light, and easy to wear all the time.  It's G-Shock quality, with sapphire glass and all the bells and whistles of Garmin's latest OS.  It would be nice to have the glitter of AMOLED, but those screens eat batteries, and battery life was my central criterion.  I also wanted a digital watch, not an analog one, and satellite nav with good maps.  Check.The Garmin store can't be compared to Apple's for add-ons, but I have found the Falcon Z and the BIG EASY watch faces to provide all the customization I really need.  Yes, it's expensive, but I've paid as much for watches before and gotten much less.",5.0

Garmin Fēnix 7,"I bought this watch to replace my Samsung Galaxy 4 watch.The battery life is enormous. With normal use, it'll last maybe 2-3 weeks. I'm not that active of a person. I'm actually probably not the audience this watch is geared towards but I got it anyways bc I wanted a smart watch that would have a charge lasting more than a day.It does exactly what I want, lasts more than a day. Nice big display.I don't like that the display isn't super bright. However, I actually bought the Forerunner 965 to try out. The interfaces were almost the same, except the Forerunner was more beautiful. When I move my hand to look at the time though, bc the Fenix is a MIP display, it is truly always on. I can at least see it. The forerunner though would be off, sometimes wouldn't turn on unless I wiggles my wrist a smidge. It's something little, I know.But, for my needs (I work in a hospital, sometimes get blood or other patient biohazardous fluids on it during procedures), it works great. I can wash it very very thoroughly. If it can survive 5ATM of pressure it can definitely handle a thorough cleaning.The band that came with it is nice. I usually losen it one or two notches overnight. The sleep tracking, which is not the primary purpose of the watch, is pretty good. I think my old Fitbit Charge 3 was more accurate for sleep timings than Samsung Galaxy 4.... And that was more accurate than the Fenix. But overall, good enough for my needs. It doesn't keep track of naps though. Supposedly there is an update coming soon to fix that.The brightness could be better BUT in direct sunlight I can definitely read it.The built in flashlight is clutch. I love that feature. I don't remember the Forerunner 965 having it but I tried both simultaneously for a week and might have just forgotten.Location is extremely accurate for me. No issues. I only used it near my house. Primarily to track my location to send to wife in case of medical emergencies while walking. Very very happy with it.Again, my use case is slightly different than the typical for the audience this is meant for. I'm not a health fanatic. Just an average person. I walk maybe 2-3 miles a day. I don't go on mountain trails that often. I don't go biking. So I can't really comment on that stuff.",5.0
Garmin Fēnix 7,"Purchased this watch to replace a dying Garmin Vivoactive 3. Having some gift card monies to spend, I really wanted a Fenix even though I knew it was much more watch than I really needed.  As usual, I over researched watches (reviews, YouTube videos, etc) but narrowed my search to the Fenix 7x Pro and the Apple Watch Ultra 2.  Although the Apple Watch is a great watch, ultimately it didn’t meet my needs as much as the Garmin.As mentioned before, the Fenix exceeds my needs but what I’ve experienced thus far, I know I made the correct choice. Naturally because it is a much more advanced watch than my outgoing Vivoactive, the features are more accurate. GPS is spot on, HR is surprisingly good, stairs counter is much more accurate, and the rep counter when strength training is much better.  I’ve been using the sleep tracker…I really don’t know the accuracy of the feature but it’s interesting all the same. I anticipate using the map features while hiking/biking once the weather improves.  I probably don’t need to mention battery life but this watch is probably second to none. I’m going from charging every other day to going several weeks on a charge.A concern of mine was the case size of the watch. My Vivoactive was 42mm (I believe) and this Fenix is 51mm. A couple coworkers have Apple Watch Ultra 2’s and I thought the size was reasonable at 49mm. Still not certain, I went to a local store that carries Garmin watches and tried on a Fenix 8 at 51mm. My decision was made after that.  It is a big jump in watch size but I was able to accustom myself to the watch very quickly. Being a larger case, all the provided data can be viewed easily instead of being smushed onto a smaller screen.My one an only dislike of the watch is the watch band. No matter how tight/loose the band was, the buckle would dig into my wrist and cause discomfort and abrasions. I replaced it with a Hēmsut band and couldn’t be happier.  I also purchased a case/bezel cover (ISABAKE) to prevent chips and scratches.Lastly, if can live without an AMOLED screen (Fenix 8), the Fenix 7 line can be had at hundred$ less. I’m not certain but other than the AMOLED vs MIP screen, I don’t think the Fenix 8 offers much more over the 7.",5.0
Garmin Fēnix 7,"I purchased this watch back in November 2024, mainly for its super accurate heart rate monitoring, especially given my history of V-tach and my implanted ICD. I was particularly interested in its newly added ECG capabilities, and in regards to obtaining an accurate heart beat readings per minute during exercise.I primarily use it for walking and swimming. For walking, the tracked distance is accurate, as is the GPS. I particularly like the lap tracking, which is based on distance, pace, and other metrics.For swimming, I used it this past week in my pool, and it accurately captured the time and distance swum. An added benefit was its resistance to seawater—specifically, the Dead Sea, where the salinity is extremely high. I was in the water for 20 minutes then came out and rinsed it well with fresh water. It resumed working like a charm. One thing to note about using the watch in sea water: it is highly advisable not to press any of the side buttons while under water.I love this watch and will most likely upgrade to future models as needed.",5.0

Garmin Approach R50,"Had to return it as I tried to work with Garmin Support to figure out why and was getting no where.For lower iron shots it was not bad.  Actually, SW, GW and PW it calculated distance out a bit longer than reality.Mid irons was pretty much spot on.Where it suffered the most was long clubs like Driver & 3W.. and a little bit with other longer clubs - but not as bad as the driver.Was having to swing like a gorilla to get 225 at best.  So not sure if it was just a bad unit or not, but was not getting the right feedback from the support team.  Ball speed on the 225 was at 140 mph.  Which is really not possible.  And yes, there are many other factors too, but when you take into account a 10 degree launch angle - most all other factors still don't equate to 225 total distance.One really positive note - never missed a ball I hit with the 3 camera system.  Was very solid there.When I intentionally wants to go left to right or right to left, it picked that up well too.  Shanks to fat, etc..  all pretty solid.Has a camera system that allows you to play this back on the screen so you can see the ball impact from the club.This is a sticker system, them you get stickers to put on the top middle of each club to help with club head speed.One really solid feature is that you do NOT need a computer in order to hook this up to a projector - comes with it's own HDMI port.This product has a LOT of promise!  It's kinda a one of a kind product in the space right now.  You'll see a lot of GREAT reviews of it.  And I'm sure most of them are solid/legit reviews.  But I had to report my frustration and findings just to be fair.  After all, if you want to play golf using the Garmin Golf SUBSCRIPTION plan you need to get (99 a year or around 20 bucks a month) you want to be able to get off the tee further than 200 to 225 yards or otherwise you're in for a very long day.Btw, one other thing I did not like was the resolution and the practice round treatment.  I want a launch monitor that shows a crisp clean ball flight away from the ground up and this did not give me that.  It really should be much higher resolution.Now the amount of data points you get is very impressive.  Along with the camera view of ball impact, as well, this picks up all ball contacts and even putting - yes, putting works here too.Btw, Home Tee Hero (Garmin Subscription Required and you get over 43k of courses) you don't put, you have two circles one that covers the outside of the green which is you hit in that you get 2 strokes putting (gimme) and a smaller circle that gets you 1 stroke putting (gimme).",2.0

The numbers on the R10 are typical to what I see on the driving range and course. The crazy thing is that the R50 is picking up the same ball speed and launch angles.

Garmin Forerunner 970,"This watch is awesome for the things it is capable to do for a runner, such as myself.I've moved on from a Samsung Watch 5(Samsung fan), to this and I have not been disappointed!I'd say it is pretty pricy, and this is my first time ever owning such a watch. I had picked this(2nd best) over Garmin's Fenix 8 (Their top watch), due to me not really wanting to pay a little extra for the extra features such as the Solar Charging or Longer battery life, because I don't mind charging my watch ever so often and I am not outside THAT much for it to make a difference. At least 2 hours at most for my training. The watch will last me a long enough (~10 to 14days) without charging and I am happy with that versus me having to charge my Samsung watch like 1.5x a day which was getting annoying. The quality of the watch is amazing, the Glass is supposed to be stronger than the Gorilla kind and the material of the bezel makes it look so premium. The charging speed is also pretty good, I don't realize how fast it charges but I know it's quick (~1hr) from 0 to 100.The sensors it has seems pretty good and capable of tracking my daily results.

It makes glancing at metrics during workouts feel much more natural and engaging. The overall resolution and responsiveness also feel like a noticeable step up from the 945.While I haven’t had the chance to fully test the mapping/navigation features yet, I’m planning to explore that soon, especially for long runs in new areas.

Garmin Forerunner 970,"I really like how light and comfortable the 970 is compared to Enduro and Fenix watches. It's also very full-featured. 5-day battery life with AOD is okay, and it charges quickly. (15 days without AOD.)The AMOLED display looks great indoors in medium-to-bright light, and outdoors if it's overcast. In active mode, it's okay-not-great in bright sunlight. Both active and AOD can be a bit too bright in the dark. The one real fault here is that the AOD practically disappears in bright sunlight.The touchscreen is extremely overly sensitive at times. A slight accidental brush of the screen with my sleeve can start rearranging my glance widgets! Sometimes it's so hypersensitive I just have to disable the touch screen for a bit. Everything is fine with the touch screen disabled. This is the biggest flaw, and I hope it can be fixed with software updates. I used the Enduro 3 for a few weeks and its touch screen was just fine, not hyperactive like the 970.Aside from the glitchy touch screen and the AOD that's invisible in bright sunlight, I like the 970 and am keeping it. In some ways I like the Enduro 3 better, but it's just too big for comfort. The comfortable 970 wins.",4.0

I can monitor my period on it, stress, sleep, activity, etc. one of the things I like is, it can detect when you go for a walk or a run or a ride and logs it, even if you forget to log the activity. It also lasts long. I've had it for more than a year. You can set what notifications get sent to the watch (which apps can do that). It has even training coaches that you can utilize for different sports. You can join different challenges from different sports. It also holds a charge for over a week mostly. Typically 10 days and if you're not that active, even closer to two+ weeks. Definitely, worth the expense.",5.0
Garmin Forerunner 55,"I was looking for a simple watch to record my cardio activity, without all the bells and whistles that some of the competitor's watches have. Come to find out the Garmin Forerunner 55 delivers on that and then some. At its price point, the 55 offers great features like an app with a fitness hub, reporting all your relevant stats, as well as watch interface that's customizable to your hearts content. I've had the watch for going on 2 months now and I'm still learning things about it. Great investment for anyone who's looking to track their fitness with a simple watch that'll get the job done.",5.0
Garmin Forerunner 55,Excellent running watch for the price. Got mine renewed and everything seems to be working as I'd expect from a new one. Has all the basic functionality I need and the GPS works really well.,5.0
Garmin Forerunner 55,"Love this! I’m just a fun runner and not really a lifter plus I don’t need a complicated high tech watch like the Apple Watch I came from! It’s easy to use, batter lasts about a week depending on how long my runs are and charges in about 2-4 hours never really paid attention but it’s fairly quick for how long it lasts. Photo comparison is my husbands fenix5plus for size comparison. I will say it does have limited options for workout modes, for example no rowing.",4.0
Garmin Forerunner 55,"I needed a heart rate monitor but saw how many more features this watch had over a fitbit, so for the same or less than the larger fitbit,  I bought the renewed version of the 55.  I loved it - for 1 day.  Then I immediately realized I needed something newer and more to really get the most out of the potential for all of the apps  The 55 is: too dim, needs the backlight on or activated all the time, battery lasted like, 4 days running with display, running breathing apps, etc. it has small fonts and icons that make it hard to see, (like the watch hands overlap the heart rate if you have that screen enabled - the overall diameter of the screen is just too small), and limited extra apps that the newer Garmin fleet has and diminished functionality of parallel apps.I returned with the 90 day refund policy and upgraded to the 165.  Now I really, really love what I've got.My opinion if it helps: if you are strapped and can only get the 55, get it. But, trust me, you will return it and get at least a 165 if you have the extra $120 (ish).  I debated over getting the 255, but, after reading the reviews (Tom's) and looking at the screen shots, really, if you are used to a smart phone at all, you will want the 165 with the AMOLED over the MIP of the 55 and 255.  The touch screen on the 165 also makes navigating through the deeper menus much easier as does turning on the display if the accelerometer doesn't activate it as needed. Of course any model higher is going to rock and roll.  I don't mind the mix of hard buttons and screen swipes.  I think it's a good combo.Too early to comment on battery life, but, so far, I like the watch enough, I honestly don't care if I can get 3 days out of it.  Def way less ""fanboy"" than an apple watch.  All reviews say it's much more geared to fitness as well.  Between the Garmin app and the phone, some fitness things sync to iPhone (which i do have, so, not an anti-apple thing, just, like the sport/athlete centric vibe of the Garmins more)",1.0

Garmin Vívoactive 3,"Still learning to use it, but it is nice.  I prefer Garmin because the charge cord plugs into the watch.

So I refer to it as entertainment!",5.0
Garmin Vívoactive 3,"I wish I could give 4.5 stars. This generally works pretty well and was by far the best option I found for $200. It has struggled with distance when it “auto starts” an activity, and Garmin customer service walked me through reloading it. I wouldn’t read too far into the “stats” that require more interpretation such as VO2max. But it works for time and distance and also gives cadence and heart rate; the last two are mostly accurate. Garmin Coach’s “5K with a time goal” program seems to be in its very early stages and I expect it will improve. I also am small-boned (size 4.25 wedding ring on the ipsilateral 4th finger to the watch) with a small wrist, and it works for me. If I had a larger wrist, I might have purchased the 935, but it was just too big for me, and I could not justify a Fenix 5s.",5.0
Garmin Vívoactive 3,"I've has this watch for 15 months.  I love the features and it works well with my android. All the measurements seem pretty accurate. I'm not happy with the battery life.

I'm slightly active but usually just a walk or 1 cardio workout 5 days a week and then fairly ""normal"" after that averaging around 10,000 steps a day. I'm looking at other garmins to eventually replace it because I really like this watch, just really disappointed with the battery. I'm assuming even though it was renewed the battery wasn't replaced and is therefore really old.",4.0

Garmin Venu 2,"With the venu 2 your options are very limited regarding text and media. It will show a notification but you cannot reply from the watch nor does it have any voice capabilities, the venu 2 PLUS, does have the option.3 stars because the watch often will “disconnect” from the phone so I have to open the connect app and sync. Not a huge issue since the watch isn’t used to reply to messages or communicate but it certainly is irritating when I want to see the weather or my calendar if my phone is at the bottom of my purse.Overall I love this watch, the battery will last many, many days while being worn 99% of the day.

Garmin Fenix 5S Plus,"I am sixty-nine year old person who likes to work out.  I bought this watch after a year of research deciding that for my uses a reconditioned watch suited my needs and budget.  Is this watch perfect, no it isn't, but I love recording my workouts and checking my results.  The watch pushes me beyond my already tendency to be obsessive.  It is also very accommodating telling me my fitness age, which i am sure is off a bit, but I can dream it is accurate.I think the map when I am hiking on the watch is too small to be really useful so I use the Gaia app instead which is great.  The watch also pleasantly adds 25 meters to my swim workout which i appreciate, though I know better.The adjusted steps that the watch sets as a goal can be annoying as sometimes you simply want to relax.  As far as the battery, if you are not going backpacking, the battery has not had a problem lasting the day even while recording multiple activities, usually no more than three though...isn't retirement nice.For all these critical elements that I have written about they are insignificant to me.  I am  not goings to the Olympics so my training does not need to be honed to split seconds. The reconditioned watch is extremely reasonable for what it does.  It is great recording my events and pushing me.  As an aside the people at Garmin Support are more than  helpful and I felt that they treated me as if I had bought the most expensive watch brand new from Garmin.",5.0
Garmin Fenix 5S Plus,"I’ve been eyeballing the Garmin Fénix for years and made this purchase to test out the Fénix features since it was priced reasonably compared to the brand new Fénix 7.

The white strap gets dirty easily, but it’s also easy to clean with soap and water. The watch works great for my workouts!

Garmin Swim 2,"This watch replaced a Garmin Venu Square that stopped charging. Since this watch is more expensive I picked up the 3-year warranty on this one.Pros: Simple to use. Outside rim of the watch protects the bezel nicely. Looks good. Accurate GPS built in. HR monitor matches well with built-in HR in exercise equipment. Looks pretty good for a fitness tracker.Cons: Only one Cardio option. Pricier than the more flexible Venu Square. Can't customize display for fitness use. No Walk event tracking.I have been sticking with Garmin because I need accurate HR monitoring in the water, and most trackers disable their HR on swim functions. These seem to do a good job with that, and if you are an avid swimmer this would be a great watch for you. It has swim tracking and logging functions that I don't use, so I can't speak to those.With this watch being so much more expensive, you don't need your smartphone for the GPS to function, but I'm a little disappointed that there's only one, generic Cardio event for tracking. Otherwise there's Pool Swim, Open Water Swim, Cycling, and Running. I suppose you could use the Running Event to track a walk or hike.Wish List: Break Cardio event into a variety of events only distinguished by there name, for more easy history analysis in the Garmin Connect app. I would like to customize what's shown on the display screens during a recording event. For instance, when swimming I want to see distance, elapsed time and HR on the main screen. Instead, all you can see is the interval distance and time, with unused space at the bottom.So, all that being said, I like this watch. While there are some things I wish it would do, generally speaking it just works. I like not having to mess with a screen protector like I've had to with my earlier, raised bezel models. If you don't mind that, always have your smart phone on you, and need more flexibility, check out the Venu Square, but get the protection plan!",5.0
Garmin Swim 2,"Update 16June2022: I just want to give a shout out for Garmin phone support. I was having trouble getting GPS to find satellites this summer, and it was losing track mid swim.  Mary Beth at Gamin support walked me through several paths to finally get the find time down to under a minute. She was patient and seemed genuinely interested in solving my problem -- a rare event from support lines these days. I'm still loving my Swim 2 after nearly a year.------- original review --------------My earlier Garmin Forerunner 310XT wrist GPS takes forever to achieve satellite lock, and it showed me zipping back and forth while I was open-water swimming, so I needed something new. It's all in the software, because a watch on your wrist will lose a satellite or two while it's under water, and the software needs to adjust for this and not think you have zoomed at high speed to the point where it regains satellite lock. Garmin has been working on this issue for some years, (as have others) and I'm very pleased with the results.I also borrowed an Apple watch for a few open-water swims. Tracking was excellent, but it has a feature that locks out any screen actions while swimming, making it somewhat difficult to control. Also, the Garmin is really built for swimming, so it has many more swimming metrics besides speed that make tracking your progress easier. The other advantage is that the Swim 2 software interface is very smooth on a PC, whereas you have to interact with an Apple watch with an iPad, Mac, etc. (There may be options for the interface that I'm not aware of.)The real killer for my use of the Apple watch was that it was less reliable reading my pulse while swimming. Both Apple and Garmin use optical pulse measurement, which is a bit dicey in the water (both say to adjust the band tight but comfortable), but often I would finish a swim to find that the Apple watch had not recorded my pulse at all. The Garmin may make some mistakes occasionally, but it keeps doing the best it can.Controlling the Garmin is not as intuitive as the Apple watch, but once I got used to it I didn't start activities unintentionally or make similar mistakes too often.On balance, the Garmin Swim 2 is a keeper and has replaced my Timex Triathlon as my main watch. The alarm, timer, and stopwatch features are more flexible than the old Timex and get a lot of use.",5.0
Garmin Swim 2,"I have worn the watch for a week.  There are many things I like about it, including the app.  However, after digging around the Garmin website, I realized that the watch and app do not automatically record pool swims when the lap time is over 1 minute 30 seconds for a 50 meter lap.  I am a senior and my best lap times for 50 yards are around 1 minute 40 seconds, which would yield a 1:54 50 meters.  Therefore, the hour-long swim does not auto register.  I have to add it to the app manually after the swim.  If I use the pool swim function on the watch at the beginning of the swim, it registers correctly.  Maybe everyone else knows about the speed issue, but I don't recall seeing it in the watch description or even in the app documention, without digging down several layers.  As mentioned in other reviews, it also does not register walks, other than steps.  I use the bike function on the watch to record my walk times, distance and routes.  It works, but I wish Garmin would add a walk function and raise the swim lap times.",4.0

The aesthetics are very pleasing, and it feels like a premium device on the wrist. Google has clearly used top-tier components, as evidenced by its smooth performance and responsive interface. For me, the size is perfect – it's substantial enough to make a statement but not so bulky that it feels uncomfortable for all-day wear.Considering the ""used - very good condition"" price point and the practically brand-new watch I received, this was an outstanding value.

Huawei Watch Gt 5,"The normal Huawei product, very special, very robust, great APP, and a great addition to my Huawei family of watches.  I wear the D Watch for sleep in order to take my blood pressure throughout the night.  This product is one I wear during the day on days where I wear my silver Oura ring.  It is accurate and gorgeous.  On other days, I wear my Cyber GT with one of the multitude of bands and faces available for that watch.  I love Huawei.  But I only gave four stars for a couple reasons:  First, the APP has problems tracking three watches and tends to delete one of them when not in use.  Garmin would never do that and I hope Huawei fixes it.  Second, this GT-5 gets disconnected from the APP occasionally, which is aggravating.  Perhaps it is a problem with my bluetooth settings on my Pixel phone.  I will check.

Huawei Watch Gt 5,"I’ve tried several smartwatches—Garmin, Amazfit—but the HUAWEI GT5 stands out as the one I truly love. From the moment I put it on, the comfort, style, and intuitive interface made it feel like it belonged on my wrist. The screen is crisp, the battery life is phenomenal, and it handles daily tracking with precision and ease.What impressed me most is the blend of premium design and performance. It doesn’t just look good—it works well. Notifications are timely, fitness tracking is accurate, and the range of features feels thoughtful rather than bloated.The only drawback—and it’s worth noting—is the limitation on downloading new watch faces if you’re based in the U.S. That feature could add even more personalization, but even with the existing selection, it’s still a joy to use.

I just don't see where other reviewers are having issues. The watch is awesome and the battery lasts a surprisingly long time compared to other watches I've tried.The only thing I recommend is, when you register everything, make sure to say you are in a different country besides the USA.

Huawei Watch Fit 3,"I have been wearing this watch for a full week and can honestly say this is way better than my older Apple Watch.  My Apple Watch 3 was going on 5 yrs old and was no longer holding a charge for more than 6 hours. I wanted a new smart watch but was hesitant to shell out $400 for a new Apple 10.  After a lot of research I decided to try the Huawei Fit 3 but I was concerned there were few reviews posted from a US based user.  So here’s my take on this interesting watch:Pros:  1.  Amazing battery life.  After first full week of daily usage, battery was at 33%.  Let’s see an Apple Watch match that.  2.  Seamless connection with my Apple 14 phone.  Leave the Health app open on your phone and it works perfectly.  I took a 2 mile walk with my new and old watches shortly after getting the Huawei, and both tracked the same exact distance .  3.  History of your exercise and health records tracks closely with those used by Apple.  Looks a bit different from Apple but the data is there.  4.  The watch face I have posted a photo of is great- it provides me with all the data I want on a smart watch on one screen- steps, bpm, weather, time,  date, battery life and  even Sp02.  5.  Price- I paid $155 for this watch and to me, this is a way better value than a $400 Apple 10.  6.  Accessories.  I purchased watch face covers and bands specific to the Fit 3 and they are interchangeable just like my old Apple 3.Cons:  No way to control your music or podcasts from the Huawei watch like you can on an Apple Watch.  For some folks, I can see why this could be a deal breaker, but not for me.I hope this review helps anyone considering this watch in the US.  After 1 full week, I have no regrets opting for the Huawei Fit 3 over other watches made by Apple, Garmin and Fitbit.  You get a lot more watch for a lot less $$$.",5.0

Huawei Watch Ultimate Smartwatches,"The build quality is amazing, better than any of the other options in the market. But for Iphone users it looks that the App is not 100% functional. There are only a handful of faces available with very ugly design since the App does not feature the ""Add watch faces"" option that is available for Android users, which seems unacceptable to me. I already updated the software of the watch to the last version and it's not the problem.Other thing that is bothering is that although the bracelet is made with great attention to detail, it does not allow to fine adjust it, so It can be very loose or very tight on your wrist. Seiko bracelets, a tenth percent of this quality, allow to do this.",4.0

Huawei Watch Ultimate Smartwatches,"First of all, the watch by itself looks gorgeous.  They could have been amazing in terms of functionality. But there is huge problem.After reviewing many watches, I decided that it would be a perfect option, and ordered this watch because I wanted to make a gift to my close friend.I never expected that there would be so many problems.Firstly, the packaging was awful, the watch arrived in plastic FedEx bag with no bubble wrap or anything that could protect from damage and no declaration or documents, in the open box, the sticker of the new product was torn off. When you buy expensive things, you want  them to be in perfect condition and package, according to the new product. Since it was opened before I decided to see what's inside. There were greasy finger stains on the inside of the box. When examining this watch, fingerprints were visible on the strap, the entire glass of the watch was stained with grease. There were greasy spots on the inside of the joint. It shocked me. To say that I am upset angry and discouraged is not to say anything. I immediately contacted the seller, and he explained that the watch was going through local custom, it was unavoidable bcz it's from other country. I looked up at the description a few times and it doesn't say that customer might receive an open box.I decided to look at the functionality. it performs basic functions, but for a more extensive one, such as the app gallery, which could give more interesting functions, it does not work. I tried to install a VPN from different points, it didn't work. that is, USA users will have limited usage.So, unfortunately, I had to return it, there is no chance to give it as a gift. I felt huge disappointment and frustration. I created return label, and I got provided return label that I was supposed to pay as I understood. I had to contact customer service to provide me a free return label. Luckily I was able to return it.",3.0

But the shipping came fine.Love the watch and I keep getting so many complements. You can get (almost) official watch straps from Aliexpress.",5.0
Huawei Watch Gt 4,One of the best smart watch in the market right now. Not only is the most accurate in the heartbeat measurements but it also has an extremely long battery life! I can go for almost 2 weeks with a single charge!,5.0
Huawei Watch Gt 4,I have been an Apple person since the early 2010s and have had 3 Apple Watches. My last one was about 5 years old and the battery was terrible - I literally had to charge it throughout the day just to get through. My boyfriend and I got each other this watch for Christmas and they were easy to set up. So far the battery life is awesome. Day 2 and I’m still at 83%. My phone notifications - text and calls come through fine. I never really replied to text on my watch so I just use my phone. I think for the money the value is awesome - so much cheaper than an Apple Watch and has all of the same qualities! The screen size is big but very clear and super comfortable to wear. So far I am very happy! Now I have only had for 2 days so I will come back to update but so far so so happy with the purchase!,5.0

Huawei Watch Gt 5,"Exactly what I expected, absolutely pretty. Was waiting for a GT watch with a keyboard and they delivered. Does not fit me completely well as I am half a ceramic link too tight or too loose (small hands dilemma) but I have extra straps coming. Looks sooo luxurious, lost a bit more than 10% in 2 days.P.S.: Use the UK as a region, put your phone in airplane mode (and vpn) and start the Health app to pair so you can get access to the AppGallery and the watch store",5.0
Huawei Watch Gt 5,The main reason that I purchased this product is because it has the golf feature. But I am very disappointed that the golf feature doesn't work in USA at all.

Huawei Watch Gt 5,I like my new watch. It appears very accurate and reliable. It’s like a personal trainer advising me  when and how to exercise.

Huawei Watch Gt 5,"Ordering was easy but returning is impossible. The watch was too expensive for the quality. It would not connect to my phone , the strap was too large and uncomfortably odd with the  ceramic coating, the face was hard to read and a lot smaller than expected. I tried everything and the watch would not connect to my phone.  There are no instructions and what little there is does not reflect on the phone  and the watch lost power very quickly while trying to get it set up when it was stated that it has a battery life of 7 days. I only got 45 minutes.The pictures of the watch made it look way more elegant than it does in person.  The ceramic watch band looks strange and feels cold on the skin. The gold trim does not look gold, it looks more silvery with a hint of gold. Very disappointed. I never got a chance to try out the health features because it would not connect to my phone.",2.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"My Galaxy (4) watch was ready for an upgrade!I always do my research and read the reviews before I buy a product. This purchase was no different. I was somewhat concerned with a number of reviewers complaining that the battery was not good and didn't last long. So, I want to address that concern first.With all of my watches I never use the Always on Display function. I realize that the watch faces are beautiful on the Galaxy Screen. However, those beautiful bright LED's use power. If you leave them on all the time you can expect maximum battery drain. I have everything turned on except the AOD. Yesterday I used my watch a lot as I was playing and experimenting with all the cool features. Wore it through the night to monitor my sleep. This morning at 6 a.m. I had used a total of 27 percent of battery power for a 24 hour period! At this rate of power usage I can expect 3+ days of use. Battery life doesn't concern me at all.SETUP (Stars*****)I was expecting to make a trip to my service provider because I use the LTE version. I figured I could do all the setup minus the phone provider portion at home. I was extremely impressed with the setup/switch procedure. Simple, straight forward and quick!I was pleased at how simple and easy the setup was. As soon as I was done I needed to let my dogs out for a walk. While I was out walking the girls my Watch rang! I answered it and had a nice conversation. The switch feature swapped over and set up all of my LTE functions without the need to spend half a day at my phone providers location!DIGITAL RING VERSUS PHYSICAL (Stars *****)I never really liked the physical ring all that much. The new digital ring is awesome! Good job Samsung!CHARGING (Stars *****)Charges extremely fast with the little charger that comes with the watch. This small charger is great for travel. I ordered a couple more.FITNESS (Stars *****)I'm still using them and can only say that so far they are still the award winning excersize App/sensors they have always been.AI (Stars *****)Wow! This opens up a whole new experience with my watch. I use Alexa to do so many things now. The ability to put Alexa on my watch is a real game changer. Don't worry, if you prefer Google assistant you can use that as well.ASTHETICS (Stars *****)I think Samsung could have done a better job with the advertisement pics out there. I was initially disappointed at how the Galaxy 7 looked. When I actually got the watch I happily realized the pics don't do it justice. I think that this is the most aesthetically pleasing watch Samsung has made to date.THE BAND (Stars ***)Nope. I knew I didn't like the watch band it comes with from the pics. If you want an extra you can have mine. I ordered a watch band from Wingle to match the silver of the watch. Wow! They are a perfect match and look gorgeous!I couldn't be happier! What a great Smartwatch. When you pair this watch with the Samsung family of devices it is in a class of it's own!OVERALL: Five Stars!RECOMMEND?: Absolutely YES!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"I've been using the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 for a couple of weeks now, and I can confidently say it's the best smartwatch I've ever owned.Right out of the box, the design is sleek and premium—it feels comfortable on the wrist and looks great whether I’m at the gym or in a meeting. The display is incredibly sharp and bright, even in direct sunlight. I would suggest purchasing a cheap pack of screen protectors to avoid screen cracking, since it's a touch-based device.Performance-wise, it’s lightning fast. Apps open instantly, navigation is smooth, and the new health features are next-level. I especially love the updated body composition metrics and the improved sleep tracking. The watch gives genuinely useful health insights, not just generic data.Battery life has also impressed me. I’m easily getting over a full day on a single charge, even with all-day heart rate monitoring, GPS workouts, and notifications turned on. And speaking of workouts, the auto-detect feature for exercises is surprisingly accurate.If you're on the fence, don’t be. The Galaxy Watch 7 is an absolute powerhouse with the perfect balance of style, functionality, durability, and fitness tracking. Samsung nailed it with this one.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"I’ve been using the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Bespoke Edition for a few weeks now, and I must say, this smartwatch truly stands out in terms of both style and functionality. Whether you're a tech enthusiast or someone looking to improve your health and fitness, this watch has something for everyone.Design and Build: A Stylish StatementThe Bespoke Edition of the Galaxy Watch 7 comes with a customizable design, and I absolutely love the ability to personalize the watch to match my style. The 44mm model offers a great balance between a larger screen for better readability and a comfortable fit. The sleek, premium stainless-steel frame and high-quality finish are top-notch, and the customizable straps add a personal touch—there’s something for every occasion, whether you’re working out or heading to a formal event.The display is sharp, bright, and vibrant with the AMOLED screen, even in direct sunlight. It’s not just functional but truly a piece of wearable art.Performance and Features: Smarter Than EverThe Galaxy Watch 7 runs on a smooth, responsive interface, powered by Samsung’s Tizen OS, which provides seamless integration with both Android and iOS devices. Notifications, messages, and alerts come through cleanly and quickly. The new AI-powered Energy Score feature is a real standout, offering insights into your daily energy expenditure and recovery, helping you optimize your activities for better overall wellness. It’s a fantastic feature for anyone focused on maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle.Battery life is impressive, lasting around 2 days with moderate use, and the wireless charging is fast and convenient. I can easily go through a full day of workouts, notifications, and sleep tracking without worrying about running out of juice.Health & Fitness Tracking: Comprehensive and AccurateSamsung’s health and fitness tracking capabilities on the Galaxy Watch 7 are excellent. It tracks a wide range of activities, from running and cycling to yoga and strength training, and offers detailed insights on heart rate, calories burned, and even advanced metrics like VO2 max. The built-in GPS is accurate for outdoor workouts, and I’ve found the heart rate sensor to be incredibly precise during both intense workouts and calmer activities like walking or stretching.One of the most useful features is the Energy Score. It uses AI and real-time data to provide a daily ""score"" based on your physical activity, sleep patterns, and recovery time. This is a game-changer if you’re looking to optimize your fitness routine or get a better understanding of your overall energy balance throughout the day.Sleep tracking is another area where the Galaxy Watch 7 excels. It offers detailed insights into sleep cycles (light, deep, REM) and provides suggestions for improving sleep quality, which I found helpful for maintaining my overall well-being.Smart Features and Connectivity: Seamless IntegrationThe Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and the ability to take calls directly from the watch without needing to reach for your phone is incredibly convenient. You can also stream music via Spotify or store offline playlists for runs or workouts without having to carry your phone. The built-in Bixby voice assistant works well, though I found it to be a little slower than on my phone. That said, it’s great for quick commands or hands-free tasks.The watch supports NFC for Samsung Pay, making it easy to tap and pay when I’m on the go—super convenient for those times when I forget my wallet or phone.Final Thoughts: The Smartwatch to BeatOverall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 Bespoke Edition 44mm Bluetooth AI Smartwatch with Energy Score is an exceptional wearable that blends high-end design with advanced health and fitness tracking. The customizable look is perfect for anyone who wants a watch that’s as much a fashion accessory as a fitness tool, and the AI-powered insights, especially the Energy Score, make it one of the most intuitive and effective smartwatches I’ve used.Whether you’re looking to boost your workouts, improve your sleep, or just have a stylish smartwatch that keeps you connected, the Galaxy Watch 7 Bespoke Edition delivers it all. If you’re in the market for a top-tier smartwatch, this is definitely one worth considering.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"Works well with samsung/android ecosystem. Has all the features I wanted, tracking sleep, vitals, activity, etc. Had lots of integration with native and 3rd party apps like audible, Google calendar. Reason for 4 stars is battery life - only way for me to use all day and then also get sleep tracking is to use power saving mode which limits the features that make this a higher end watch. Personally, I think the trade off for features vs battery life like the fitbit charge has makes that a better product for practical use.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"I have owned the Galaxy watch Ultra for about a month now. From someone who has, and still wears, an Apple Watch ultra 1 also. I can say that they both, for me, do exactly what I want. The Galaxy however, to me personally, is the better looker and is less buggy. I have not had to shut it down because of any freezing, or glitches. It has tracked my workouts great, and the battery is really good. However, I don't believe the battery life is better than my apple watch, but close. I am an active person, so my watch gets used much. I recommend the galaxy watch ultra to anyone who is on the fence about getting one. If you don't mind big watches, and you track your runs, calories, and any workouts, I don't see you going wrong by picking one up. Just remember that every use case is different because we are all different.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"The watch is fantastic. I do not want samsung to go back to a traditional circle watch. I like this square-circle thing they have going on.

Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"The Ultimate Smartwatch Experience!I recently got my hands on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47mm LTE AI Smartwatch, and I have to say, it’s an absolute game-changer! From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by the attention to detail and premium build quality. The titanium frame and sapphire crystal display not only look stunning but also feel incredibly durable, giving me confidence that this watch can handle anything I throw at it.The 47mm AMOLED display is nothing short of spectacular. It’s bright, sharp, and responsive, making it easy to read notifications, track fitness stats, and navigate apps even in direct sunlight. The customizable watch faces are a fantastic touch, allowing me to switch from a sporty look during workouts to something more professional for the office. The LTE connectivity is a standout feature for me—I can leave my phone behind and still make calls, send texts, stream music, and even use GPS navigation seamlessly. It’s perfect for runs, hikes, or even just quick errands without being tied to my phone.When it comes to health and fitness tracking, the AI-powered sensors are incredibly accurate and insightful. The heart rate monitoring, SpO2 sensor, advanced sleep analysis, and ECG capabilities make it feel like having a personal health assistant on my wrist. I love the detailed workout modes that adapt based on my activities, providing real-time feedback and post-workout analysis that helps me track progress effectively. The GPS is also impressively accurate, which is a must for my outdoor runs and cycling sessions.Battery life was a pleasant surprise, considering all the features packed into this watch. I can easily get two full days of use with LTE, GPS, and continuous health monitoring enabled. When I do need to recharge, the fast-charging feature gets me back to full power quickly, which is a huge plus for someone constantly on the move.Another aspect I appreciate is the integration with Samsung’s ecosystem. Syncing with my Galaxy phone was seamless, and I love the ability to control smart home devices directly from my wrist. The voice assistant is responsive and accurate, making tasks like setting reminders, controlling music, or checking the weather effortless.Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47mm LTE AI Smartwatch is everything I could ask for and more. It combines a sleek design, powerful performance, and comprehensive health tracking into one impressive package. Whether you’re a fitness enthusiast, a tech lover, or someone who just wants a reliable and stylish smartwatch, this is absolutely worth the investment. I couldn’t be happier with my purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a top-of-the-line smartwatch!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,Why did you pick this product vs others?:Excellent product !!Features:The features are so amazing and covers are the areas I was looking for,5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"I’ve been using the Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47 mm for months—this thing is built like a tank (titanium case + sapphire crystal + MIL‑STD‑810H + 10 ATM water resistance) yet feels surprisingly light on the wrist. The 47 mm AMOLED display is super bright (up to 3,000 nits) and stays sharp whether I’m hiking under the sun or diving into the ocean.What really sets it apart is the battery life—the 590 mAh cell easily lasts 2 days in normal use and can stretch to 48 hrs in exercise mode or 100 hrs in power‑saving mode. Switching between workouts is seamless—thanks to Wear OS and the Quick Button, I can set up multi‑sport tracking (like triathlons) and GPS is impressively accurate with dual‑frequency support.On top of that, the new Galaxy AI insights give real-time feedback on my sleep, recovery, and energy levels—no subscription needed . Sure, it's chunky compared to standard Galaxy Watch models, but for anyone who wants a rugged, reliable smartwatch that actually lasts, this is it.",5.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"It's been a long time since someone commented on a watch I was wearing,  but last week a coworker loved the digital watch face. I like how customizable it is. There are so many free watch faces and colors to choose from and download and install from the app on your smart phone.There are so many functions to this watch it's mind numbing. Easy to setup using the Samsung app. The watch itself is very sturdy and has survived some hard bumps without a scratch.My only wish is for longer battery life. With everything running, the battery lasts about three days for me.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,Beautiful functional smart watch. The band is a great color,5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"What I Liked:I’ve had prior experience with tech refurb work through T-Mobile, so I tend to keep my expectations in check with Amazon Renewed products, but this one genuinely impressed me. The Galaxy Watch 6 Classic I received was near mint, cosmetically flawless, and has been running perfectly after several weeks of daily use.I was expecting to see some telltale signs of refurb wear like battery drain, slow charging, or connectivity issues.. I’ve experienced none of that. Battery life is solid, the LTE and Bluetooth connections are stable, and everything works exactly as intended.The rotating bezel is easily one of the best parts of the experience—responsive, smooth, and satisfying to use. The watch is comfortable on the wrist and packed with features like HR zones, sleep tracking, and health insights that all seem to function without hiccups. I actually liked it so much I bought one for my wife too. it hasn’t left her wrist since.What Could Be Better:The OEM watch band is the weakest part of the setup. It gets the job done, but it feels cheap and lacks comfort. I'd recommend upgrading to a quality aftermarket band to really round out the experience.Bottom Line:For a renewed device, this exceeded all expectations. Near-new condition, reliable function, and all the smart features working as advertised. If you’re on the fence about buying this renewed, don’t be. Just plan to grab a better band, and you’re set.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Upgrading to the 47 mm Galaxy Watch 6 Classic felt like switching from a studio apartment to a penthouse suite. The larger Super AMOLED display offers generous real estate for maps, workouts, and quick replies while looking absolutely sharp under bright California sun. The physical rotating bezel returns as the crown jewel, giving precise, tactile control that never smudges the screen.Performance is snappy thanks to Samsung’s newest Exynos W930 chipset paired with 2 GB of RAM, so apps launch instantly and tiles scroll without stutter. Battery life stretches to a full 40 hours even with always-on display and frequent heart-rate checks. A quick thirty-minute top-up on the included fast charger easily carries me through the next day.Health features are where the watch earns its keep. The upgraded BioActive sensor suite delivers reliable ECG, blood pressure, and body-composition readings, plus it finally nails automatic workout detection for strength training. Sleep Insights 2.0 offers actionable tips rather than generic “sleep more” advice, and the new skin-temperature tracking adds an extra layer for wellness monitoring.Build quality feels premium. Stainless steel housing, sapphire crystal, and IP68 plus MIL-STD-810H durability mean I can move from paddle-boarding to a client meeting without swapping devices. Paired with One UI Watch 5 on Wear OS 4, the watch plays nicely with both Android and Google services, so I can reply to texts, tap to pay, and navigate Spotify playlists with equal ease.At around four hundred dollars, the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic 47 mm positions itself as a flagship smartwatch that actually acts like one. If you want a timepiece that blends old-school bezel charm with cutting-edge sensors and two-day endurance, this is the techy sidekick your wrist has been waiting for.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"My thrid Samsung watch after taking 5 year break from them. Has mostly same great features, just enhanced. I got the blue tooth version this time, need to stay somewhat close to your phone to talk. Great phone and function though and very light weight so wearing all night isn't a problem. The 43mm version is perfect size for my wrists and not wanting a clunky watch. These kind of amazing products and great prices are why I've stuck with Samsung and Android since we left the Blackberry keyboard days. I love the watch, and screen covers are easy to find but you can dive in this watch, or swim in a pool with it everyday like I do. So glad I got it, because 2 days later I was able to take a surprise call while my hands were full. I would have missed the call could have been quite costly. I like the features and having spotify and youtube music and more apps on it. Solid Product - I'm singing Samsung praises once again.  Came deliivered in good shape, not original anythng and I wonder if even the band is the right one. But I love it  100%.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"The watch is great! I only took a star away because I think the charger and band are crap. The band wasn't in good condition and actually broke apart a few times which made my new watch fall to the ground. Thankfully I had purchased a new protective cover for it and the watch wasn't damaged. I had also purchased new bands ( I didn't have them yet when it fell) and a charging station for both my phone and watch. Now that I have all the pieces together, I love it! The watch itself though is in great condition and so far working perfectly! Battery life is way different than the galaxy 4 I had before. So just know ahead of time you're paying for a renewed watch and it will most likely need newer things with it to make it perfect, but still WAY cheaper than all NEW.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Just a great watch. I love how for 40 bux you can change the face to your tast for the day all year. If you spend this much money, at least get Facer or in my opinion you've wasted your money,  cause the faces is where it's at for me. I was certain I didn't need the lte but would have gotten it for sure if I knew than what I know now. I have no regrets just would have gotten it. I love the black, but sort of wish I would have gone with silver cause of the bands you can buy. It's a very good feeling watch nice and heavy.Change the band immediately unless you like to live in discomfort and protect the bezel not the screen. Trust me and if you insist on screen protector the inner are you will put it on is like bevel or cone shaped so if the glass isn't you'll regret it 🤭 add tons of music and pictures easy to use and change. Turn your notifications sound to vibrate and minimal sounds or when it gets to updates you'll be a very noisy fellow. And turn your screen to AOD and only push button to wake. Battery is good but not for the first month when it's figuring out your usage patterns I wish you can adjust the speed with your bezel turn you have to turn it like one whole rotation to scroll like 3/4"" of page and also the direction. For some reason I'd rather turn it the other direction. Watch is a 5/5 still but dont expect it to be miraculous. It's just a watch with smart features and incredible if you  are into fitness which I'm not. Love how it works when I jump on my bike and when I'm off it's very accurate with steps and bike riding.Spend the money and buy something you will use everyday. We'll worth it for the price. Get it used if you can or you'll spend like 40 bux for the price of Tape you'll cut anyway🫣",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"The watch is a watch.  It is great I just wish they made the bands a little longer. Any ways;, cool watch. The dog is on Samsung.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Bought this in black and its perfect! Great option if you have a small wrist like me, this size of the screen is a great fit for petite wrists along with your ""average wrist"". I couldn't decide if I wanted this size or bigger and I am SO glad I went with this size!! I changed the band on mine because I didn't find the one it came with to be very comfortable. Its durable and connects easily via bluetooth. If you are like me and don't want to pay for a watch service through your mobile network but would like to still enjoy a smart watch that answers phone calls, and text messages then this is great! I obviously can't go too far away from my phone or my bluetooth will disconnect and I can't use the call/texts features BUT the reach is pretty far I have never had an issue. I can text and answer calls even with my phone being in the other room. I also LOVE this ""find my phone"" feature when I misplace my phone (which is often). If you are in the market for a smartwatch I recommend this one!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Great smartwatch, but battery life could be improvedI bought this watch in ""Used as New"" condition, and it really exceeded my expectations. The watch arrived in perfect condition, as if it were new, and I haven't noticed any difference in performance.The design is impeccable: elegant, light and comfortable to wear all day. The screen is wonderful, with vivid colors and excellent brightness that allows it to be used without problems even in the sun. In addition, the functions are complete and practical, from health monitoring to notifications and integration with my phone.The only drawback is that I would have liked the battery to last a little longer.Still, I am very satisfied with the purchase. It is a great smartwatch that delivers what it promises, and the shopping experience on Amazon was also excellent.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"really wanted to keep this watch as the 40 mm size was perfect and loved the features.My use case was very simple, using it as a stand alone cycling fitness tracker that syncs to Strava fitness app.  I wanted it to record my miles ridden with gps and also leave my phone at home and still be able to make phone calls in case of emergency. Everything was working fine even though the miles tracked with gps were about a tenth of a mile off from my phone for every ten miles ridden. I could tell from the gps map of my ride using both the watch and the phone that my phone was able to track more accurately. There was less variability in the gps signal.Ok, so I could live with gps being off by a mile over a 100 mile bike ride.I was also comfortable with the battery life. Seemed like I could get a good 7hours or more using cellular, gps tracking, and data service. The rest of my day I didn't even wear the watch.The deal breaker for me was the lack of external heart rate monitor support.Shocker!  I have seen reviews saying how the heart rate tracking for the samsungs weren't that good and I had an external polar heart rate monitor I wanted to use. Well, I could not do that. I could not get my motorola phone to recognize the HR Monitor via bluetooth. I researched some and found some people had luck getting it to work with a little effort but only with a Samsung phone. Mine was a motorola.Sorry, but I need an external hr sensor so that was the deal breaker since I know the google pixel watch and the apple watches support that.If you're not picky like me and can live with the less accurate heart rate tracking built  into the watch then it's a great device and probably the best android based watch. I really didn't want to have to move to the apple eco system just for a watch.",5.0

Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"I've had a 4 Classic since 2021 and there's enough to like about it that I haven't seen a watch I'd rather have. The battery life is the biggest downside. You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit. A black band would put more focus on the watch itself.",5.0
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 46mm is a feature-rich and stylish smartwatch that blends the best of traditional watch design with modern technology. The rotating bezel, advanced health and fitness features, and Wear OS functionality make it a versatile choice for Android users, especially those who want to track their health and stay connected on the go. While the battery life could be better, the fast charging feature helps mitigate this concern. If you're looking for a high-end, well-rounded smartwatch with a classic design, the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is a top contender.",5.0
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"I have been using The watch since one year now. The watch works great and is good in measuring steps, heart rate, stress, bp and blood oxygen. The mobile watch data transfer is seamless and am loving the classic dial. The only problem is the battery life, which lasts only 12 hours. But that's understandable given the price. Overall happy with the purchase.",4.0
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"And to think you can buy a top of the line smartwatch from a few years ago that compares to the price of regular watches. I paid 400 when this watch released back In 2021, It got water damage. Then I decided to buy this refurbished watch, it was great but I lost it in a week, but Keep in mind it didnt come with the original cable, but that was okay to me because I still have the original cable from the other watch, and if youre wondering. Yes, it has the same charging speed. So after I lost the watch, I decided to buy it again. Make sure to turn on remote protecting & anti theft, and turn on Location sharing so other people can find your watch if you lose it. And try to keep it away from water if you want it to last you a long time, we dont really know how good that refubrished waterproof seal is, but even my brand new one is bought on release got water damage after a few months, so just keep it away from water if you want it to last a couple years.Final thoughts, just buy it, its 60 and the perfect balance between functionality and price, or you can wait 4 years until today's top of the line Samsung watches sell for under 100, Your choice!",5.0

Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"I'm very much enjoying this watch.  I refuse to spend much money on a watch, so when this went on sale at a bargain price, I went for it.  I came from an Amazfit that was starting to annoy my by refusing to do alerts.  This Samsung watch is a couple of generations old and is refurbished.  I cannot tell that is isn't brand new, and everything works well.  I have a Samsung phone, so using the Samsung Wear app and syncing to the watch was super easy.  Battery life is great - I'm at 75% after using it all day (no way am I going to be wanting to sleep with a watch on!).  The step count is accurate.  Setting what apps to alert was easy.  The display is nice and bright.  I haven't bothered with EKG or other body measurements - I care about step counts.  Along with that it purports to measure activity and calories expended - I have no way to know if they're accurate...  Anyway, bottom line - I'm very happy with this watch!",5.0
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,I've only had for a few days and I love this watch.It has warned me about my heart during exercise and after setting up on my galaxy s23 phone it has so many helpful features.It arrived on time and in perfect condition.The band is too large for my wrist but I had one that fit the watch so all is good.If it keeps working it is now I'm a happy person.Thank you,5.0

Battery life is decent, usually lasting 1.5 to 2 days on a full charge.",5.0
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,So far-Very happy.  Watch was in like new condition. Did have issue charging it the first time. The watch kept saying overheating charging stopped. However I was doing updates and system setup simultaneously.  It did charge normally overnight.  I was unsure if I wanted a galaxy watch and was toying with the idea of joining the fruit phone people because I like their watch. I didnt want to spend ove $100 on a watch I was not sure I'd like.  I am glad I came back to my senses. Love this watch,4.0
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"Honestly, I regret buying this watch. The battery doesn't last very long. And when I say it doesn't, I mean it only gives me about 6 hours without using the features it has. If I use the watch for texting or music, it lasts less time. I have to keep recharging the battery. The watch also arrived with a lot of scratches, and honestly, for the price I paid, I expected something more decent.",1.0
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"I can't believe I was able to get a decent Samsung smart watch for so cheap, refurbished or not. I actually really like this. My previous smart watch was a Samsung, so I knew basic stuff about how to/what to. The watch did come with a quick start guide and a charger, both very nice to have. It has all the same bells and whistles I was used to, plus more. I actually used the flashlight feature last night while my tiny was sleeping so I could move around without turning a light on, and that worked great. The battery isn't too bad for my purposes. I got 2 days out of it, but I tracked steps and sleep only. I did blood oxygen, and that depleted my battery pretty quick, but I just wanted to see what it was like. Neat feature, but not one I need. Anyway, it's on par with what my non-refurbished old watch used to get, so I'm very happy about that.The battery was dead when it arrived, but I got it charging and used my phone to do most of my set-up while it juiced. The other nice thing was a lot of my stuff transferred from my old watch to the new, so I didn't have to add back my alarms and stuff. That was swell. I also like that the watch can do sound alarms, and they're not super annoying or obtrusive.All-in-all, good watch. Happy I took a chance on the refurbished. And the size is just perfect for me, too.I did manage to scratch it already (I just got it this past weekish), but I have a toddler and I'm a klutz, so that's probably my doing anyway.I would like to suggest NEVER taking it swimming, or even in the shower, even though there's tracking for swimming and a ""water lock"". That's how I killed my old watch. It had/was the same that way, and now I'm just super distrustful of any watch that claims you can go swimming with it.",5.0
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"The watch is good, it barely has any scratches, it still has it's great features, the fit it good but difficult to get off from your wrist, it's easy to use and set up and it's small so the readability is limited but still readable, the charging speeds are okay and the watch lasts me 9 hours, however in the description it states that it was a Bluetooth version but when It came it used LTE and came with T-Mobile while I was using AT&T 🤨",3.0

The seller did send a return slip but it wasn't worth my while to return as this item was sent to my box to be shipped overseas. Then I decided ok...may as well try to salvage some usage out of it...overheating, poor charging and a host of other issues with this obviously used and obsolete piece of trash. A real rip off if you ask me. This is the screen now after less than 2 weeks of usage.  RIP OFF",1.0
Samsung Electronics Galaxy Watch 4,"There are two things I don't like about this watch. First, it comes with the standard Samsung band and charger which are not very impressive.

My 3 stars are for the watch not being as clean and brand new looking as (excellent condition) would lead you to believe. Functionality however, is the quality ude expect from a Samsung product.

It tracks thing like it should, its interesting to know how long you sleep and what happens and more.Just when you first get it it will have a lot of system updates, they don't put it all in one, I did have to do it 5 times and each time it would drain my battery and I'd have to recharge to 30% to update it again, this did take about 5 hours, till I could finally use and play with it, so don't be so frustrated about the situation or think something is wrong with battery like I did lol.",5.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"I recently purchased the SAMSUNG Galaxy Watch 5 (40mm Bluetooth Smartwatch), and overall, I’m quite impressed. Here are the things I love about it:Intuitive Setup: Getting started was straightforward, from installing apps to connecting and creating accounts. Everything synced seamlessly.Tracking: While my primary goal was to track physical activity, I was pleasantly surprised by its sleep monitoring feature. It not only tracks my sleep patterns but also offers tips to improve consistency, which is incredibly helpful.Personalization: It’s easy to change watch faces or swap out bands, making it adaptable to any style or situation.Automatic Activity Recognition: The watch impressively tracks my activities automatically, even when I forget to set up a workout. Whether I’m walking, rowing, following a workout video, or simply tidying up around the house, it picks up my movements accurately without manual input.Convenient Alarm Syncing: I also love how it syncs with my phone alarm. As autumn settles in here in Illinois, mornings can be dark, and alarms are easy to miss. The watch vibrates along with my phone alarm, making it harder to ignore and ensuring I get up on time.What Could Be Improved:Blood Pressure Tracking: While this isn’t Samsung’s fault, I wish the US allowed blood pressure monitoring on this device. I have another watch from Temu with this feature, and it’s incredibly useful for seeing trends and understanding how different events impact my stress levels. It encourages me to manage stress more effectively rather than compartmentalize it.Battery Life: The battery longevity is a bit disappointing. I primarily use the watch for fitness, sleep tracking, and basic functions like stress measurement. Given my moderate usage, I expected the battery to last longer between charges, but I find myself needing to recharge it at least daily - as frequently as my phone.Final Thoughts: Despite these minor drawbacks, the Galaxy Watch 5 is well worth the investment. It’s reliable, versatile, and convenient, and I believe it will last a long time. I would definitely buy it again.",4.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"I was hesitant to write this review because I was planning on returning the watch due to the heinous software consistency but for some reason they are allowed to put a longer return window on the Amazon return date than they actually accept. So now I am stuck with this piece of junk. That being said it is more than deserving of a one star review. If you like watches that one major feature upgrade than their counterparts but the feature absolutely does not work accurately or give you the option to check it 90% of the time I would like to introduce you to the skin temperature feature on this watch. Some how the most basic features for a smart watch is also incredibly unreliable and unavailable most of the time, this would be the heart rate monitor. Oh and I hope you like connectivity issues because that is all you are going to get with this. In the first 2 months of trying this product out it got disconnected from my phone 4 times and took days to reconnect. ( I have an android) sure this thing counts your steps but it counts a different amount then the feature my phone already includes so now I have to wonder which one is wrong. And beware the ""WiFi battery saving feature"" for some reason since the device would die much faster if it was constantly using WiFi it only uses WiFi when prompted to through specific settings/user interaction. But if course if we are having connectivity issues with everything else how surprising is it that this junky watch can't decide whether it should actually preform it's automatic setting tasks because it is capable of consistently reconnecting to the WiFi then updating these apps or tracking widgets... What ever, literally don't even try streaming anything Spotify and audiobooks that aren't downloaded are never going to consistently play for more than 2 mins. But don't worry you also won't have enough space to download music or books or too many apps, even though every app seems to need a second widget or app to operate on the watch...  Honestly not even sure how this watch is very usable it's like having a disappointment strapped to your wrist at all times. I just wish they would have honoured their window of return that was printed in bold every time I went to the return center but they are allowed to put a completely different one half way down the return instructions list. Not all of us have the time to thoroughly read the return instructions until we are ready to return... When I thought was during the return window... Very misleading",1.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"Really happy with this Samsung-compatible smartwatch. It arrived in excellent condition, no scratches or damage, and came with a charger. It was boxed with a plastic sleeve instead of padding, but it still arrived safely and looked brand new. Great packaging for a refurbished smartwatch.🔧 Setup ExperienceThe watch powered on immediately, but setup wasn’t completely intuitive. I had to look up how to turn it on (which button or buttons to push, etc) to get started and navigate a few steps before things felt familiar. That said, if you’ve used Samsung products before, it’s pretty smooth from there.A quick start guide would’ve helped for initial setup. Not a dealbreaker, but something to keep in mind if you're new to smartwatches.🔋 Smartwatch Battery LifeBattery performance was excellent. I charged it in the afternoon, didn’t charge overnight, and by morning it was still at 75%. It also charges very fast. For a budget-friendly smartwatch, that’s better than I expected. Definitely solid smartwatch battery life for the price range.📱 Easy PairingConnected to my Samsung phone without a hitch via Bluetooth. Pairing was fast, and once I was past setup, everything worked smoothly. Notifications, features, and tracking all synced properly.🧾 No Receipt IncludedThere was no printed receipt or paperwork in the box. Might not matter to everyone, but worth noting if you're someone who likes keeping a physical record of your tech purchases.💬 Final ThoughtsIf you're looking for a great value smartwatch with long battery life and smooth pairing to your Samsung phone, this one’s a solid choice. Just be aware that initial setup might be tricky for someone less tech-savvy, especially without a manual. Once you’re up and running, though, it’s an easy daily wear.",4.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"I bought and “excellent condition” watch and this is what I received. I have MULTIPLE problems! Please read if you’re thinking about buying.First major complaint is the fact I paid EXTRA to receive a like new/ excellent condition watch. The watch I received is what I expected from purchasing “good condition”. Almost every corner is scratch.The second picture is the box it came in. Extremely sketchy. This watch was supposed to be the 5th generation, but if you look very closely at the band they gave me for the watch it says “for Samsung galaxy 4”.Last problem, but DEFINITELY THE WORST ONE… the battery was completely dead. At first I didn’t know if it was gonna turn on after charging for a whole hour. If you know anything about lithium batteries you would know it should never ever be completely dead as that ruins the potential for the battery to hold a full charge. With that being said I’m assuming this will die very quickly.In conclusion, i recommend whole heartedly to just purchase a watch brand new.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"The watch arrived completely dead and with no charge. It finally showed 0% on charger after short while on the charger. I couldn't get it to charge past 60% but maybe it would charge further with an old smartwatch charger I had been given.Thats bad for a li-po battery to be stored or purchased at such state! Usually goods in ""Excellent"" condition are shipped with plenty of charge and with a charger that works too. Otherwise it's useless. I suspect this watch didn't have a good charge and it sat on the shelf for a long while and self discharged.After setting it up to my phone (~30min), and it said that the battery was low (10-15%) before I would be able to wear and use it!I can't use this and doubt it would work for many of the features like sleep tracking or a workout longer than an hour.This won't work for a trip I planned to take where I expect a watch to keep a charge for at least 4 hours. Many state you can get a day out of the battery. I couldn't get a fraction of it!How can this be considered refurbished if it was bad and not fixed?Seeing I was trying to get this in time for a trip, it's a bummer to not get something working in its stated condition, and it seems like this is a common issue?",1.0

Samsung Galaxy Fit 3,"My wife and I have been fitbit fans since the Charge 2 (2016).  Before the google purchase, fitbit was a strong leader in lower cost fitness trackers.  It did concern us that our fitbits would die frequently (nearly each one we had died within a year from the Charge 2, 3, 4). However after talking with customer service they would send us replacement.  So, ok, we can deal with that.  (Even though in the past few years you had to provide a ton of documentation including, IIRC, your drivers license.)I had a fitbit 6 that I got for Christmas 2024.  Wow, a color screen.  LOL.  I needed a replacement as the screen on my Charge 5 kept getting dimmer, and dimmer, to the point when I could not read it outdoors and barely indoors.  So I was gifted the Charge 6 and it was big step up.  But it took me a few months until I realized that the floors option was gone, not just not working, but removed, to make space for other features I could care less about.So I looked around in late June and discovered the Fit 3.  So I bought one.  I am SO GLAD I did.  What do I need?  Step counter, heart rate, floors, distance, calories.  Oh, and the kicker for me was AIRPLANE MODE.  I study various energetic sciences including BioGeometry and the EMF coming from our devices is not benign.  I don't wear a tracker to sleep, don't want anything live, and keep my blue tooth turned off unless I am actively syncing.This is what I see comparing Fit 3 to Fitbit Charge 6.   What the Fit 3 has as an advantage:  Larger screen, airplane mode, beautiful faces, much cleaner UI on the watch and in the android app(s) (I am using this with a Pixel 7 phone).  The ability to sync only turning on bluetooth.  A few years ago fitbit/google basically said we aren't syncing your fitbit unless you have both location/GPS and bluetooth turned on.  Sometimes you could get the fitbit to sync with location off but this was tricky/spotty.What advantages did the Charge 6 have for me, personally.   None really.  It cost about 3x the amount for the Charge 6 compared to the Fit 3.  That's ridiculous.In a head to head comparsion of measurements this is what I see.   Fitbit Charge is often slower to start your step counts and the Fit 3 is quicker on that.  So you steps counts are going to go up and perhaps the Fit 3 does count some arm motions as steps when it should not.  But the Fit 3 is still very close (within 1-3%) with the Charge 6.  The Fit 3 tends to undercount calories compared to the Charge 6, I can't tell which is more accurate.  On the Charge 6 bluetooth syncing was always a laborious pain taking sometimes minutes to get the past few days of data and often having to turn bluetooth off/on and/or restarts to get it to sync.  The Fit 3 is very fast *most* of the time.  I did have one instance where the Fit 3 was not syncing in the Health App and I had to open the Wearable app and trigger a sync from there, which worked.The big thing is battery life.  I have automatic activity tracking turned on and except when syncing in the evening I keep it on airplane mode.  I charged it overnight last Thursday/Friday before I first put it on.  It's now Wednesday evening, nearing 6 complete days of use and my battery level is at 55%.  That frugal energy use is really good and is on par with the earlier monochrome fitbits.I am very pleased with my Fit 3 purchase.  Back in the early to mid 2000's I was very excited about Timex was doing just in digital watches (Iron Man, etc).  The Fit 3 harkens back to those kind of days for me when you could get a very full functionality wrist device that looked good, worked great, and was a good deal.  This is definitely worth a close look if you don't need an higher priced fitness/communication device that is emitting EMFs into your pericardium meridian 24x7.  Well done.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Fit 3,"Great smart watch for the price, the quality is very good.  I had previously purchased two other no-name brand smart watches and this one blows them away.I purchased this watch mainly for step tracking (and of course time keeping).Secondary reason was to be able to receive and respond (quick replies only) to text messages.The watch has other great features (please go look at reviews from a YouTuber).Price is not gonna break the bank, and the quality is VERY GOOD.  Samsung did a great job, well constructed.  Battery life is long lasting.This watch helps motivate me to hit my step count, and I just barely starting using it for sleep tracking too.If you purchase it, may I suggest a cover for protection.Definitely 5 stars!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Fit 3,"New in box watch is great and functions perfectly. The screen is great and is much larger than my old watch so I can see the time without my reading glasses! It is easy to use and tracks like my old fitness tracker (sleep, exercise, heart rate). I'm impressed with it so far!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Fit 3,"I bought this watch because I was looking for a smaller watch to wear to bed and around the house to keep an eye on my sleep and Heart Rate and so on. On that note it seems to do great at tracking my HR and sleep. I have tried quite a few other watches and just could not find one that worked for me but this one is small enough that it's comfortable to wear at all times and even great to wear when sleeping. I have not had any issues with it's phone connection it seems to stay connected the only time it looses connection is when I walk across to the other side of my house but as soon as I get back within range it instantly reconnects to my phone with no issues.It's nice because I can keep track of the battery level of my phone (Galaxy Flip 6) and watch using my watch.I do wish it had a speaker just for receiving notifications, phone calls and alarms but the vibration does a good enough job of letting me know.I can usually get about 5-6 days of battery life out of it and the battery charges quite quickly.One of the only complaints I have so far for this watch is the band has a connection system that requires you to buy an adaptor if you want to use another type of watch band. But they are usually quite cheap and easy to come by so it's not to big of an issue.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"I had to return my first watch as the battery life was awful but the customer service team was helpful, insanely prompt, and gave me every bit of info I needed to get my replacement watch. The replacement works perfectly and looks almost new. I will 100% be returning to this company for any refurbished electronics I need!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,Good product. Battery could last longer.,5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"Great Smartwatch! This device truly has all the functions and features I want and need. From fitness tracking to notifications, it covers everything I was looking for. The stylish look makes it a great accessory, and the easy-to-read display is a huge plus—especially when I’m on the go. I can easily check messages and track my workouts without any hassle, and it’s comfortable enough to wear all day without feeling bulky.However, I do wish the battery life were a bit better. By the time I get home from work, it’s almost dead, which can be a bit frustrating. Thankfully, I just plug it in to charge overnight, so it’s ready to go for the next day. Despite this minor drawback, I’m really happy with my purchase overall. If you’re looking for a reliable smartwatch that combines functionality with style, this is a great choice",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"I found out why my watch will not stay charged (in case anyone else has the same issue). The app is no longer applicable to this watch version, so I can't do a factory reset to fix it. I've ordered the new Galaxy S25 from Samsung which is how I found out about the app.I have always been a Samsung customer, phones, computers, etc.  I had a Fitbit Versa 2 and it finally died.  All I want from a wearable device is number of steps walked, heart rate, and the sleep information.  I know the Samsung has many more capabilities, but these are all I want to use (plus the time of day).  When mine came I only set the above readings to be active. I like the look of the watch and I would be happy if it would just work. After charging it and it charges quickly the battery lasts about 6 hours.  This past week it has begun to charge sometimes and other times I'll pick it up and all it will show is 0% and the icon indicating it needs to be charged.  I've done everything I know to do in the app and on the Samsung site.  If anyone out there has a suggestion as to how to fix it, please let me know through Amazon's messaging system.  I like the fit and everything about the watch, but it just won't hold a charge.  Thanks",1.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,Love this watch. I  also like the workout routine you can create on it. Very durable and the fact I change the straps is a plus.,5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"UPDATE: I've had this watch for about a month now.  I am very happy with it.I bought it for work, so I could leave my phone in my bag but still be able to see phone calls or messages. (I have 2 autistic kids, I need to be reachable). I sweat to much at work to keep my phone in my pocket, it tends to be loud at work, and I dont feel the vibration in my pocket when I'm moving. All causing me to miss important calls and messages. This watch is my solution.I've tried other brands in the past and they were not reliable at all. The connectivity is very good on this one, I can be several feet from my bag and have no problems. Messages and phone calls come thru every time.Although I did not buy this for the fitness features, I will say they are neat. I work in a factory and I find it amusing that it starts an auto workout whenever I'm packing. Its interesting to see the results at the end of the day. I have not used this for sleep, I mainly only wear it at work. In doing so, I only need to charge it every 3ish days, the charge holds well. And it only takes an hour and a half or so to charge.The app is easy to use and I like all the options available to customize.I was very nervous buying renewed. But so far I am beyond happy with this watch. There is absolutely nothing to indicate it had ever been used. It works as it should and has held up well getting banged around at work. I also like that it is not really big or bulky.I did replace the band with a silicone break away band for work. I like the new band better as the original was very stiff on the sides.Did not come in original packaging,  which is fine,  I expected that.The watch literally looks like it was never worn. Not a scuff or smudge anywhere.Fired up and synced with the app with no problems.Seems to work as its supposed to so far. Calls and messages received. I like the customization.But since this is renewed, I'm skeptical.  I will update after I've had it a while and see how it holds up.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,Love it. Design is very sleek. Very durable and water resistant. Can use it for days without charging. Stays connected to my phone unless I get a couple walls between the two. Features are very easy to use. Tracks my sleep patterns better than I do. Arrived in very good and working condition.,5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"The watch came in non-original packaging, just a white box containing the watch and charging base. I recharged the battery and set it up very easily using an S24+. A software update was required. I have been using it for a month, the watch works well, the battery has lasted two days. Connectivity is good, notifications work well. The strap is comfortable, but the fact that it doesn't open completely can make it difficult to use some types of chargers. It's a big watch, so be aware of that. Despite its size, it's not uncomfortable to wear. It's a nice looking watch, and it appears to be durable, the metal case looks very sturdy. The health mapping features are very interesting. I recommend purchasing it, it's a good choice.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"It's a good watch, but there are some disappointing experiences:1) First time I went for a run and wanted to test out the cellular connection, it overheated and told me to wait.  This happened twice since I've owned the watch, and it's usually been on actually hot days.  I do have a protective cover, so that may be part o the problem.2) Run tracking is buggy...sometimes.  I often start my run from my front door, where my watch has a connection with either my WiFi or phone.  When I start a run from this location, it always seems to have trouble determining how far I've run.  I'll be 3 minutes into my run and it will say I've done a mile (I wish!).  If I bring my phone with me, there is no issue.  If I drive to a trail and run it does perfectly fine.  I have the feeling their run tracking is using a WiFi rough location to start my run.3) Spotify.  This won't count against the watch so much, because it's probably mostly a software issue.  I would think it's a pretty good chance that using Spotify with headphones while you're not around your phone is a pretty good use case for a cellular watch.  This does work, but it's really not intuitive to use.  Sometimes the Spotify UI will just sit there and not tell you whether it's trying to play something, or if it's loading, or whatever.  You can literally sit there for minutes fiddling around trying to figure out what Spotify is trying to do.  Sometimes when it does work, the events are delayed.  For instance I may have chosen a song 10 seconds ago, and gotten no feedback from the UI, yet it will eventually play something.4) Google's apps aren't fully integrated.  It's like they're still not fully committed to wearables.  For instance, if someone is at the door, you will get a notification.  Would you like to see who it is?  Well, you will have to go find your phone.  There are many apps that don't show useful notifications on the watch.  There is so much opportunity to make wearables actually much better than they are, and it's frustrating that Google just doesn't put in the effort.That's pretty much the bad stuff.  Now for the good news.  When this watch works, it does a really nice job.  The watch faces built in are really nice IMO, and you can customize them pretty well with useful shortcuts. (I added a shortcut to start a workout and another to set a timer).  We do get Google Assistant now, and I've assigned mine to be triggered by long pressing one of the buttons.  Google pay works fine for me.  In my experience the battery is much much better than my previous Android watches, which removes some level of anxiety.  The build quality is great.  I am rough with my watches, and the screen on this one is pretty much scratch free at this point.  I take this in the pool and in the shower, so absolutely no issues with water exposure.  The workout tracking software is actually great when it is recording correctly.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"I bought a Galaxy watch 1 refurbished in February of 2020 and wore it most every day with out any issues at all. Just recently, the battery was not lasting as long but still operating perfectly. I decided that I wanted a newer model, so I did a bit of research and decided on a Galaxy watch 5 Pro and felt very comfortable going with another refurbished unit. The watch arrived on time in excellent condition with its charger and band. It works great and there is no way to beat the price!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"Been about a month since I've purchased this renewed version of the GW5 pro. It came almost flawless, besides a few minor scuffs on the outer bezel. With all features on, continuous monitoring, adaptive brightness, Wifi, Bluetooth, NFC, sleep, step & stress tracking on, along with frequently checking messages, weather radar, and my daily planner, I can get about 36 hours of battery life. With all those features off on power save mode, it can last roughly 60 hours. So depending on the desired use, you have a decent window to work with. I charge mine once per day, typically on my lunch break. Charge time takes about an hour to fully charge from 40%. Even faster if you shut the watch off. If you're not worried about a rotating bezel, the GW5 PRO is a fantastic smart watch. Even more so than the GW6 classic in my experience, which when fully utilized dies in about 20 hours. My GW6 classic is about 20 feet deep in my local lakeside community and honestly, I'm glad I got the GW5 pro. I couldn't deal with the constant need to charge. Also, the new One UI 6.0 and the wear OS 5.0 update that came thru a few weeks ago seemingly gave the watch a smoother look, feel and font, along with more accurate sleep and health monitoring abilities. 5🌟 All day.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch5,"So I ended up buying this watch about a week before the 7 series dropped. I haven't kept up on watches, had the original Samsung watch, loved the looks, but was worthless to me because I couldn't even make it through a work day without charging. My fitbit died, so I went looking, saw reviews talking about battery and saw the price and went for it. Then the 7 came out and I felt like I made a mistake.I certainly did not. This thing is a beast on the battery. I get a ton of notifications, reply to them, play around on it, and easily get more than 2 days of use. I typically just charge it in the mornings as I get ready for work. Yes, I wear it as I sleep for tracking.The 'renewed' or whatever this is, is great. Not a scratch on it, looks absolutely brand new. The charger they send with sucks. Sucks really bad. Order yourself an OEM charger and toss the one that comes with it right away, or else you'll be charging an hour a day... With the OEM you do not need to do that.It's big, it's light on the wrist with the titanium, I'm extremely rough on watches, each Fitbit I owned was scratched up within days, after a couple of weeks, this still doesn't have a mark on it. Was concerned about buying renewed, but was extremely surprised and happy about the condition of my watch.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch5,"It's a great vendor and a wonderful watch. I am just loving this Samsung watch. This was purchased renewed. The battery life is very close to new. I can get 2 days out of a 100% charge, but use a lower charge ratio to increase the battery life. The functions are all perfect. This was a replacement for my Samsung Watch 5 that was destroyed when I dropped it on the bathroom tile floor. I  purchased an after-market watch strap and case with a glass screen protector. If you are familiar with this particular version, it has a large screen and a lasting battery. These are fundamental qualities I was looking for in this watch. It has not disappointed. Absolutely recommended!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch5,"I was looking into a fitness tracker when I stumbled across the ""Amazon Refreshed"" Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. I never wanted a smart watch, but I did want a way to track heart rate, steps, and my workouts. For the price of the refreshed option and the comfort of knowing I could return it if it wasn't as expected, I figured, why not give it a try? I'm a Galaxy girl and have all Samsung devices so it fits right in.First, the watch shipped without original packaging - there were a couple comments that said they received all the original packaging so I was initially a little bummed about that. But not like I need more packaging to take up space. The charger included in the box is not OEM but it does work to charge the watch (it is the slower 1A 5V charger). The watch itself looks brand new. Can't tell that it had been used at all. I put it through its paces and it seems to hold a charge very well. I had actually also purchased the black version and the Watch 6 (both refreshed) to see which one I like best. The 6 came in OEM packaging and while I preferred the size of the watch 6, the battery life couldn't come close to the 5 Pro. I also preferred the brushed nickel look over the black version of the 5 Pro. I was worried because this model indicated it is the Latin America version, but it works just like the other 5 Pro.The watch is huge and I have very small wrists so it has been an adjustment wearing something so bulky. The OEM band was too big for me and even though I made it work, the excess strap caused an awkward fit. I replaced the band with a thinner silicone band and it is much more comfortable now.That said, the features that it offers are impressive. My favorites: body composition analysis, sleep tracking, integration with Samsung Health and my fitness apps such as GymRun & MyNetDiary. I also love being able to get messages and texts without having to pick up my phone. This watch is a key motivator in helping me achieve my fitness goals so for that aspect alone, worth the refreshed cost! I definitely won't hesitate to buy Amazon Refreshed for other items in the future, just know that there is a spectrum of what you'll get.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"I've had a 4 Classic since 2021 and there's enough to like about it that I haven't seen a watch I'd rather have. The battery life is the biggest downside. You can stretch it by running very few of its features continuously, but then what is the point of having it at all in that case? Using all the features to track your personal health journey, it is possible to get nearly full day charges, but you have to time a period of inactivity in which to fully recharge the watch in order to get through the night for sleep tracking and through the typical day. It charges relatively quickly, but this can still be hard to accomplish. Because of this, I bought a second watch here in refurbished condition. My plan is to let my day watch charge overnight while I switch to this watch for sleep tracking and use as a general backup. The Samsung Health App seems to deal with this well so far. I just turn the watch I'm going to charge off, then turn on the next watch. I never charge them while they are on. The condition of the watch was indistinguishable from new. It even came with a charger and a new band. The band is not my favorite, but it isn't uncomfortable either and will serve my purposes well. I looked at a new Watch 7 and Watch 7 Ultra, but even with longer battery life, the main problem that it eventually needs to be charged is not solved. I'm liking the solution of just having two identical watches best. As for the watch itself, I like it a lot. It isn't 100% accurate in all circumstances with all features, but it is close enough to be informative. If you need medical grade information, I'm sure you'll never find it on any watch to date. This is a heavy watch. If you don't like those, this isn't for you. My first Watch 4 Classic has survived over 3 years of use and I work blue collar type jobs. I've been surprised how tough and durable the screen is, mine still doesn't have a scratch. I think the dial bezel, which is a great feature in use, does a great job of adding protection. I got the silver color and it just looks like a classic watch with a modern flair. The grey on the band takes away from the crhrome a bit. A black band would put more focus on the watch itself.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic 46mm is a feature-rich and stylish smartwatch that blends the best of traditional watch design with modern technology. The rotating bezel, advanced health and fitness features, and Wear OS functionality make it a versatile choice for Android users, especially those who want to track their health and stay connected on the go. While the battery life could be better, the fast charging feature helps mitigate this concern. If you're looking for a high-end, well-rounded smartwatch with a classic design, the Galaxy Watch 4 Classic is a top contender.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"I have been using The watch since one year now. The watch works great and is good in measuring steps, heart rate, stress, bp and blood oxygen.

Overall happy with the purchase.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"And to think you can buy a top of the line smartwatch from a few years ago that compares to the price of regular watches. I paid 400 when this watch released back In 2021, It got water damage. Then I decided to buy this refurbished watch, it was great but I lost it in a week, but Keep in mind it didnt come with the original cable, but that was okay to me because I still have the original cable from the other watch, and if youre wondering. Yes, it has the same charging speed. So after I lost the watch, I decided to buy it again. Make sure to turn on remote protecting & anti theft, and turn on Location sharing so other people can find your watch if you lose it. And try to keep it away from water if you want it to last you a long time, we dont really know how good that refubrished waterproof seal is, but even my brand new one is bought on release got water damage after a few months, so just keep it away from water if you want it to last a couple years.Final thoughts, just buy it, its 60 and the perfect balance between functionality and price, or you can wait 4 years until today's top of the line Samsung watches sell for under 100, Your choice!",5.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"I'm very much enjoying this watch.  I refuse to spend much money on a watch, so when this went on sale at a bargain price, I went for it.  I came from an Amazfit that was starting to annoy my by refusing to do alerts.  This Samsung watch is a couple of generations old and is refurbished.  I cannot tell that is isn't brand new, and everything works well.  I have a Samsung phone, so using the Samsung Wear app and syncing to the watch was super easy.  Battery life is great - I'm at 75% after using it all day (no way am I going to be wanting to sleep with a watch on!).  The step count is accurate.  Setting what apps to alert was easy.  The display is nice and bright.  I haven't bothered with EKG or other body measurements - I care about step counts.  Along with that it purports to measure activity and calories expended - I have no way to know if they're accurate...  Anyway, bottom line - I'm very happy with this watch!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"Had this watch for about a week now. I was initially hesitant about the purchase, as this is my first smart watch. After research, and getting acquainted with the tool, I'm so happy I pulled the trigger. I use it every day for surprisingly detailed sleep tracking, enhanced step/activity tracking, ease of checking notifications and responding when I don't have easy access to my phone (or if I'm not supposed to at work), and on top of all of that, it's just a fantastic looking watch. The amount of functions you have access to is fantastic. I have paid more in my life for a watch that literally could only tell time. Lol. I know the health monitoring data may not be spot on, but it has really helped me focus on the right things during day to day. If you're on the fence, do it. If you have a Samsung phone, definitely do it.Some tips:1.) I recommend the first thing you do is order the official Samsung wireless charger to go with it. The charger shipped with this watch is off-brand and charges at about 5 watts, which takes about 2.5-3 hours. The Samsung charger provides 10 watt fast charging which takes 90 minutes at most. Again, the included charger is aftermarket, and slooowww. Get the Samsung one. The battery life on this watch is good, but not phenomenal, so having a faster charger is key to low stress ownership. These smart devices take at least one or two charge cycles to optimize battery use, so be patient with the first couple of battery cycles. I got one day out of the first two, then started getting a full 2 days easy, with slight tweaks to functions, but still fairly liberal use. I've attached screen shots of my batter usage stats after the break in period. If you want to have everything running all day at full capacity, again definitely get the Samsung charger so you can juice up faster after a day of heavy use.2.) This is not a brand new watch. It was manufactured in 2022, and used by a previous owner for years. Do not expect it to be in perfect cosmetic condition. For the price, I think this is reasonable (approx $100 vs $400 new when it came out). Mine has a couple of blemishes, but the screen is in excellent condition. Still looks great to my eye! Consider getting a case and screen protector.3.) I also recommend taking some rubbing alcohol, a micro fiber cloth, and some q-tips to the watch on arrival. The refurbishing on it is okay, but I did still clean off a thin layer of built up grime from the previous owner, especially in some hard to reach spots.4.) If you are fairly active I recommend getting a different band for the watch. The OEM rubber one ends up slipping all over anytime I build up a sweat. If I try to tighten it enough to stay still, it ends up pinching and cutting off blood flow. I work in food service, so having to constantly readjust the position through my shift has been annoying. I also have slim wrists, and forums seem to say the ""no gap"" bands are to be avoided. You want that gap so the band can bend down from the mounting point to provide more wrist contact.In summary: This watch has been a super enjoyable addition to my health tracking, Samsung ecosystem, and just general gadgets I use on the daily. I love it! Still giving it 5 stars despite the effort I've had to put in to make everything work right for me, because the price is an absolute steal. I don't have money for a brand new smart watch, but this one still holds its own with the current market, from what I've gathered, and even provides better battery life than a lot of brand new watches.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,The watch arrived in almost new condition.  There was only a very miniscule nick on it that I corrected with a sharpie marker.  The screen and back are perfect.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"Like many others, I got the watch refurbished to save half off the sticker, which is still pricey for a last gen model. I figured since Amazon was fulfilling the order, it would be easier and safer to replace a defective one if I got unlucky (as I have been burned before and am very wary of renewed products).It's been about a week and to be honest I was expecting glitches, but none have yet to be found! The refurbishing partner clearly knows what they're doing in fixing up their tech. The original seller listed for my purchase was Chubbiestech.The only thing to be aware of is that there is clear evidence that this is an opened and refurbished product - adhesive remnants around the face edge and some scuff marks around the ring were the first things I noticed upon opening the package. That being said, these were very minor blemishes that I ended up covering anyway with a watch case. The screen itself is completely clear of any scratches or marks, and so far responds to touch very well.The operating system seems to respond at a fair speed. Not having owned a brand new version of this same watch, I can't say much more than this. By general ""feeling"" of OS responsiveness, this watch could maybe be smoother as it sometimes hesitates or stutters between changing screens. However, it could very well be the limitation of Samsung's OS itself and not anything to do with the refurbishment.Battery life has also been fair - the watch would last me about 72 hours as a moderate user (daily exercise, step count, HR monitor every 10 minutes, overnight for sleep tracking). Heavier use (music, phone calls) brings down the battery a lot faster as to be expected, but I see it lasting at minimum 24 hours without charge. Charging takes about 20 minutes to juice up ~30%, so I can expect a full charge in 1 hour as long as the watch isn't dead. I did not receive a Samsung charger, but the unbranded one works just as well.Overall, super happy about this purchase, and even happier for getting it basically half off the market price for a brand new one!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,I'm 78 had my 1st A-Fib incident a week ago. This inexpensive used almost new phone will now monitor me 24/7. Also this is my first smart phone and phone I've worn in at least 15 years. I'm going to love this mini ... another form ... of a computer. Man life can be quite interesting sometimes. Just be open to learn new things like this phone has all ready taught me ... LOVE IT!,5.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"This works great and has alot of features. I have 2 complaints though. The battery does not last nearly as long as it could, and yes I do realize none of them last as long as they say. The other is I had to buy a different band as the original kept coming loose. Beyond that I like this watch.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"Saw some of the reviews and the condition of the watches they got so I was on the fence if I wanted to place an order. Figured what the heck and took a chance. Watch showed up yesterday and looks brand new, had a few smudges on it but they wiped off. Was surprised to see I got the golf version with a black band, but I don't mind as the green button adds a little color to an all black watch. Watch is fast and snappy, taking a little getting used to not having a bezel like on my Gear S3 Classic but overall I'm really impressed.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 5,"For a couple years I've been searching for a watch that had multiple alarms that can be set to vibrate. Seems pretty simple I thought. Not so! Being a fan of Casio watches I hoped they would have one. They have watches that vibrate, but none with multiple alarms. I tried a few off-brand smart watches, they were a pain to use. I really didn't want to spend 300 bucks on a watch to have this seeming simple feature. On a whim, I decided to try a refurbished Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro. 99 bucks, and if it doesn't do the trick, I'll return it and continue searching. This watch does it! Yay! The fact that I can set it up from my phone is an added bonus; being 65, my eyes ain't what they used to be. So I got various alarms set up (coffee brew, wings on the grill, etc.) and was pretty happy. I don't really care about all the health stuff. What really pleased me was when I was listening to music from my Plex server on a Plex HTPC. I was controlling the music from my computer, but also had Plexamp open on my phone. All of a sudden I look at my watch, and there is a Plexamp interface! Whoa! I can control the tunes from my phone too! How awesome is that?! This watch will NOT be going back, it checks all the boxes and then some!",5.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"The watch arrived in perfect condition with absolutely no signs of wear. Seriously, I cannot find any scratch or scuff anywhere on it. The band also appeared to be brand new. All functionality works perfectly including LTE connectivity. I was able to add it to my T-Mobile account with no issues.  Battery life so far appears to be just fine with about 40 hours on a charge based on my use. Included in the box was an official Samsung charger and wall adapter. The only sign of any wear was on the charger with some light scuffs that would be expected from normal use. Save yourself a ton of money and buy this one! About $150 for a basically brand new Watch 6 Classic LTE seems too good to be true but this absolutely isn't!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,Enjoying my watch. Came in like new condition.  Only give away that not new is the box.  Quickly up and running.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Purchased in excellent condition this refurbished watch was a steal of a deal!There was still some data that I had to remove from the last owner and I just reset the watch.It works just as the new ones do, no chips or scratches on the face and the bezel is very nice.Only real complaint is the charger that it comes with is for a galaxy watch 4 (slower power delivery and sometimes it doesn't recognize the watch at all.) so I suggest getting the charger for the watch 6 when you buy these refurbished.Maybe get a band as well, the one that is sent with it is a band and will work with the watch, but is very uncomfortable and smells a bit.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Honestly, I can't tell that this wasn't a new device at all. In addition, it is also able to be used as a stand-alone phone, The only downside is that it will only retain three contacts. The only other downside is it is a bit large for a person with small arms, such as myself. Get a fast charger for certain, as this will only stay powered up for around 24 hours. My plan is to get the latest version when they are released next year and use this one as a trade-in. I will probably get more for it than I paid. If I were to trade it for the latest model, it would be around a $300 credit from Samsung, which is $100 more than I paid.",5.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,I wanted to write a review about the renewed Galaxy watch. The delivery came on time.

When you first receive your watch make sure to charge it and pair the watch to your cellphone and check for software updates for the watch.The watch updated 4 times before I was set and ready to go.The battery life lasts all day and I make sure to charge the wstch at night.Overall it was a good purchase for the price.,5.0

Samsung Galaxy Fit 3,"Why did you pick this product vs others?:I chose this Samsung fitness tracker for the price, much cheaper than Fitbit, and because I have a Samsung phone. I got it mainly for the step tracking feature to encourage myself to walk more. I'm really enjoying it and it seems to work quite well (so far the most I have done is 17,000). But my goal is 10,000/day, which I meet probably half of the time. My second most favorite feature is the ""Find my phone"" feature, just tap it and the phone beeps loudly. (Awesome!!) I've missed wearing  a watch, so I  really like that, and finally seeing texts pop up is nice too, so that I don't have to have my phone right with me always. I tried it at night to track my sleep for a couple of nights, but I decided that probably wasn't healthy to wear it constantly. It seemed accurate though. I like the way it looks and also I like thar it is water resistant. I purchased protective face covers that work great also. It paired easily to my Samsung Galaxy A13  phone. Although you charge it by attaching it to your phone, it charges really quickly, in under half an hour.  I've owned it for a couple of weeks and have been wearing it almost every day.",5.0

I forget it is there.,5.0
Samsung Galaxy Fit 3,"I love this watch/fitness tracker. It keeps accurate count of steps and syncs with the app I use for exercise tracking etc. It is very comfortable to wear, is a great value for the brand and what it does.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"This is a Bluetooth only Galaxy Watch 6 Classic in 47mm size.  It is the classic version so it has a rotating bezel.  The one I ordered is a stainless steel silver color and has a gray silicone band.  It is the third galaxy watch I have had, but the first I have purchased ""renewed.""  Out of the box it took about 8 minutes to set up.  The initial setup started as soon as I turned on the watch and my phone found it (I didn't even have to open the Galaxy Wear app, but that is probably because I already had a Galaxy Watch 4 connected.)  The only hitches in the setup were with the Google tie in to the watch, I had to do two steps twice to get them to complete.  The downside on the watch as received is that is had roughly a 5% charge, so getting started with updates, connection, setup, etc. without putting it on a charger would have been an issue.  I put it on a charger and continued the process once I realized the battery was so low.  I would recommend charging the watch first before starting the process to be safe.  The watch came in a zip lock plastic bag and the only other thing in the box was a magnetic charger base that plugs into a USB A port.  There were no instructions or any other items, so for a user who is new to a Galaxy watch this could be a bit of a problem.  The watch looks very good, the case looks like new, the strap looks like new, the display also looks like new, only the black outer part of the back looks like it has seen some wear.  I plan to give it a thorough cleaning with the disposable alcohol cleaning towelettes that I use to clean glasses once it is fully charged.  Because I had already used a Galaxy watch, the setup transferred all my settings, apps, and the watch face to this watch, which probably shortens the setup time.  A 47mm watch size is pretty large, so it might not be preferable for smaller wrists, but I am hopeful that the battery may last a little longer than the 43/44mm models.  The watch uses the same quick release 20mm bands that most other Galaxy watches use, which I consider to be a huge advantage over custom bands.  The renewed sixth generation watch cost about 43% of what a new similar seventh generation watch costs, so I thought is was worth taking the chance on a renewed watch.  The watch is a little heavier than the forth gen basic version I have, but I think the larger case and rotating bezel are worth the extra weight.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,I have had the Samsung Galaxy Active 2 for years. It's been a solid staple that I love. Battery life was never disappointing.. I always loved using it.Last week I noticed it was finally quiting on me. The sensor part in the back broke apart so I decided to pick up another watch when I saw this one for around the same cost... Renewed.I didn't know what to expect. I was not expecting much actually. But when I opened the box and turned it on... Wow. I was totally impressed.It's bigger than I thought it would be. Not a deal breaker. But omg it is sooooo nice. The quality is amazing. The screen is awesome. It's easy to use. Easy to set up with lots of options.Apple watch who?! This watch beats that with the battery life. Absolutely loves this watch!!!,5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 6,"Okay, so I finally caved and got the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Classic, and honestly? I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner! I was a bit hesitant about the price tag, but after a week of wearing this thing, I can confidently say it's worth every penny.First off, it just looks fantastic. The rotating bezel is back, and it feels so satisfying to click through menus. It gives it a real classic watch vibe, which I love. The screen is super crisp and bright, even when I'm out in the sun trying to read my notifications.Setting it up was a breeze – it paired with my Samsung phone instantly. I was a little worried about the battery life after reading some reviews, but it's been surprisingly good for me. I can easily get through a full day and night, even with using the sleep tracking and some light exercise tracking. I usually just pop it on the charger while I'm getting ready in the morning, and it's good to go again.Speaking of tracking, this watch is a beast! It tracks everything – my steps, my workouts (and it automatically detects some!), my sleep quality (which is actually pretty insightful), and even my heart rate and blood oxygen. It's given me a much better picture of my overall health and has motivated me to move more.The notifications are super handy too. I can see texts, emails, and app alerts right on my wrist, so I don't have to constantly pull out my phone. I can even reply to quick messages directly from the watch, which is a lifesaver when my hands are full.Honestly, I can't think of any major downsides. Maybe the price is a bit steep for some, but for the features and the premium feel, I think it's justified. If you're looking for a smartwatch that looks great, is packed with features, and actually makes your life a little easier, the Galaxy Watch 6 Classic is a winner in my book. I'm absolutely loving it!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"While the battery life leaves something to be desired, the watch is pretty great. The fact that it's refurb doesn't seem to be the cause of the battery drain, it's same for new ones based on what I see on the interwebz.The watch band that was sent didn't fit the watch I received, but the seller did issue me a partial refund so that I could purchase an appropriately sized band. Just an error in shipping, which they did resolve with the refund.Overall a good purchase and the seller was very responsive in correcting the issue with the band.",5.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 4,"This is my first time getting a watch from Samsung. Previously I've used fitbit watches.So, my review.____Pros-----1. I like the style. Very nice, and it fits well (which is great because I have massive wrists, and normally have to get different bands.)2. It's very easy to use once set up, and has a lot of customization features.3. So far, haven't had any issues with the buttons getting stuck, or sticky.(I've only had it for a month so we'll see.) A little hard to clean dust out of the area where the bands connect (I work in a warehouse full of dust. So that's probably just a me problem)_____Cons------1. It takes a very long time to charge, and tends to die fast if it's not always plugged in. The charger does not always work, especially if it's plugged into an outlet with literally anything else plugged into said outlet.2. It gets very hot while charging and I have to detach it from the charger one in a while to let it cool down.3. It says it tracks my walking routes but I have no idea how to access them. I have tried looking it up, but I'm not the greatest with this stuff, wish it was easier to check.4.the bluetooth can be a bit weird sometimes. It will connect to my earbuds randomly.Hope this helps someone",4.0

It hooked up seamlessly (with the help of my 14yo daughter 🤣) to my Motorola G 5G with no problems at all.  All of the Samsung health functions seem to work pretty flawlessly, the only thing I can't use is the ECG but I knew that going in since I have a non Samsung phone. The wrist band that came with it is comfortable enough to wear to bed! I read a ton of reviews about battery life and I must admit the 1st day I wore it I thought the reviews were correct, but I love gadgets and I probably fiddled with it more than most and I had the brightness all of the way up and by 10am it was at 17%. I adjusted the notifications, and a few settings including when the screen turns on and brightness. I easily get at least 2 days on 1 charge.

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"I couldn’t be happier with my upgrade to the galaxy 7 watch. I loved my galaxy 4 watch and therefore struggled with my decision to replace it until I received the 7 and started to use it. I thought the 4 was just fine with one big flaw…whenever I would use my Samsung clock app to set reminders, the reminder would go off on my phone but I was not able to dismiss it on my watch. Really annoying and it just seemed like a huge oversight on Samsung to not have their watch integrate with their clock app. I set a lot of reminders for everything, so this was a annoyance at least six times a day. Much to my delight the first time one of my reminders went off after putting on my watch I was able to swipe away the reminder that was ringing on my phone in another room! Other things I really like about it are the sleep apnea test, and just the overall smoothness of swiping between screens in the responsiveness of the screen even with a screen protector on it I’m sure there are lots of other things. I would begin to appreciate, but about the upgrade, but for now, the alarm integration was worth the price. Love that it was available for a big discount due to the expected release of the Galaxy 8 watch.",5.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"Yes, the price is real.  Yes, there's a catch.  This watch is the International Edition that is registered for use ONLY in SE Asia (Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, etc.).  You cannot select regions outside of that on the watch and must instead set the region on your Samsung Account (using your phone).  However, this watch is fully compatible with ALL official accessories and comes in a real Samsung box with intact quality seal.  There are dozens of bands, cases, etc. in enough colors to make anyone happy.The watch itself is kind of a glorified sensor and your Galaxy phone does all the heavy lifting.  Note that US customers do NOT have access to the heart monitoring features (ECG/blood pressure).  It will simply say ""this function not available in your region"" and refuse to let you go further. However, it does measure blood oxygen, body composition, sleep parameters, etc.  It's also fairly stylish and the 40mm watch face is PLENTY big enough.  You can use your phone to download many kinds of useful watch faces, apps and such and push them to the watch. Using the Samsung Wear and Health apps (pre-installed on all Galaxy phones) makes using this pretty easy.  You can also take calls on it and the sound quality is good.  The other person might not even know you're using your watch!The watch charges with a little magnetic disk only as it has no ports on it.  You MUST use a magnetic charger.  You can get some second-party chargers that work.  The battery life, as with all smart watches, is pretty bad.  You will get through a day or so of light use but no more.  It wants you to wear it at night but it won't last that long so I tend to charge it up while I eat dinner so it will be topped off when I go to bed. A bonus is that the charger for it works well with external battery packs and connects pretty strongly so you can charge it in your bag if you were on a bus or plane. It also connects only with Bluetooth, so if you are in Airplane Mode, you will need to activate Bluetooth in Airplane Mode to get the watch to connect.The band is kind of wonky as the excess band goes UNDER the strap and not over it as a Casio band or typical band, but it's soft and the holes are numerous and finely spaced to give a good fit.  I like the way it feels and it seems quite sporty.  You can get other bands if you really want to change up the way it looks.Overall, this watch is pretty nice.  I have chargers at the office and home and I use the little included one in my travel bag. I am sure that, in 10 years, we will laugh at how primitive our watches were, but, for now, this is one of the best accessories for your Galaxy phone.  I believe it's a better deal than the Google watch and will probably be getting some of these for my family come Christmas.  I am only removing one star because the battery life is so wonky and the ECG feature isn't working.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"I got the 47mm Watch Ultra. I had a hard time spending so much on watch, but now that its on my wrist, I'm so glad I got it. This is the best watch I've ever had; better than I had expected. Everything works as advertised, plus lots of fuctions. The screen is so big, it's easier to use than other smart watches I've had. The battery is really strong; I use it a lot at work for 12 hours and still go home with at least 75%. It keeps a charge better than my phone does. The microphone and voice-to-text works great. It's loud at work and the mic on my old phone couldn't hear me but this watch hears every word, crystal clear. Connectivity is great; I've had no problems with Bluetooth or WiFi, but I don't use the 4G so I don't know about that.My last watch was 42mm and this is 47mm. It looks and feels huge, but with the trail band, this is the most comfortable watch I've ever had. It's the most customizable watch, too.I'm left handed, so I wear my watch on my right wrist. This is the 1st watch I've ever owned that I could invert, so the buttons are facing my hand. I can finally use my fingers for the buttons instead of using my thumb.I'll update with pics later.",5.0

Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"Had this watch for a few months now. And FINALLY there is a watch that doesn't just feel like its dead all the time. I charge this watch maybe once or twice a week depending on how much I use the functions on it. But the battery life is way better than any previous gen Samsung watch by ALOT. Ive had a handful of Galaxy watches  since the first Watch 2. And the biggest issue with smart watches was always just daily charging and feeling like it was just a worse cell phone you were attaching to yourself that was always dead when you wanted to use it. Now, it actually feels like a watch and even when using all the heart rate tracking features (which are super good btw), phone calls, all that. Battery will last about 3-4 days. Other than that, it does what most smart watches do. Great Watch.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"It is not practicable for me to do a comprehensive review on the Samsung Watch Ultra here as there are so many functionalities on this gadget.I will just share my experience of swimming with it. It is one of the primary reasons why I bought the watch in the first place.What I like:After setting up the watch, I just need to press the multi-function button once to bring up the exercise screen. Scroll to the Pool Swim icon. Click on it and that is all to it.The display is very clear and informative. I do not look at it all the time, but I do like to take a quick peek at the time taken after every 100 meters to see how I fared.What I dislike:The watch monitors my heart rate, lap time, rest time between each lap, among other things. While the data does give an overall picture of my exercise, they are not entirely accurate. In particular, the heart rate data often does not agree with what I did. When I swam at the aerobic heart rate, the watch would end up showing my heart rate falling largely in the anaerobic zone, and vice versa.",4.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra 47Mm,"The Samsung Galaxy Watch Ultra is a premium smartwatch that truly shines, especially for those that want a full featured smart watch.Before this watch I purchased a Garmin Vivo and a Venu. They were both fine watches but they aren't truly smart watches, they are health trackers with some smart features. This watch is a smart watch first with health tracking as well, just not as good as the Garmins.PROSDurable and Stylish Design: The titanium build feels incredibly robust and ready to handle tough conditions, while still looking sleek and modern. The bright, crisp display is easy to read in any lighting.Smooth Performance: The watch is snappy and responsive, making navigation and app usage a breeze.Long-Lasting Battery: The battery life is a significant improvement over an iPhone watch for example. I found some tutorials online about optimizing the battery and I'm getting about 3.5 days on average.Useful Features: You can program some of the button to quick launch apps. I personally like to do this for the google assistant to set timers, reminders, or to get quick info about something.CONSBulky: The watch is on the large side compared to a Garmin VivoSport for example.Lacking Health: The watch has something to be desired on the health tracking side. I ended up buying the Hevy app for my workouts. If your primary focus is for health, I would look at Garmins.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"The watch was as if it was brand new. The quality is pristine, with the only down side being that the original Samsung seals were open and replaced with third party seals. The watch looks very good and has no scratches, knicks, or damages of any kind! The size of the watch is normal but the band for the 40mm is small/medium so I had to get a third party watch band to fit my wrist. The battery life in general lasts around 2 days without AOD on. One thing to note, the first day you receive the watch it will look like the battery is draining super quick, that's normal. Just charge it until it's 100% and fully updated. Then the battery life will be fixed! The workout tracking is good and picked up a workout while I was moving stuff to a car so that was really interesting!",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"Love it! I got an Amazon renewed one and it is perfect quality, just like any Samsung product (and received as a brand new one would come, in box etc). Very nice looking as well and not one scratch on renewed watch either! The watch was very easy to link with my Galaxy S23. I've had it for several months and no issues. The battery life is amazing. It's comfortable too. Great value!I was worried the color of the bezel would look too gold, however it does not. I purchased a separate stainless silver-link watch band, and a clear bezel protector. The bezel matches the band perfectly, it looks silver (I think it is actually a light tone gold, but blends well). The original band is nice too, I just wanted a more ""dressy"" look.",5.0
Samsung Galaxy Watch 7,"Perfect. Absolutely happy. It came in perfect shape, the box it was shipped in was the original because it was a remanufactured watch I suppose. Other than that it's a fantastic deal. I've had it for about a month. It's very durable. I did put a bezel protector and a face protector on it. There were only a few dollars and it's been very useful. The battery lasts about 2 days if the battery saver is on. It lasts a little over a day if the battery saver is off and I track my sleep.  The sleep tracker has more features than I'm used to. It will actually track multiple sessions of sleep in one night. I tend to wake up after a couple hours for 30 to 40 minutes and fall back asleep. My previous watch wouldn't track this. This watch catches all of my sleep time and rates it together. It gives you an energy score which is actually seeming pretty accurate. It also gives me very good insight into the things I need to do to improve my sleep hygiene. I've been working on this a lot and I still got a lot of good new useful information. I have large hands and wrists, the watch fits me great. It would probably fit from a man's small wrist up to even larger than mine.",5.0

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I have had this product for a week now and I am love it. I was hesitant at first to buy a smart watch because of the accuracy, expensive prices, and another screen to distract me.

It actually has more capabilities that are useful and make my everyday life more convenient. I really just wanted it to track my sleep and it does a great job!Specs that I like:- battery lasts for days. I haven't even drained the battery yet because when it gets to 80% after two days, it only takes 20 minutes to charge back!- display interfaces that you can change and personalize- real-time data of heart rate, sleep data - which is accurate to the minute I wake up.- can take pictures and video by tapping my smart watch when phone is on tripod- timer- quiet, vibrating morning alarm clock- can pause or forward music playing on my phone from watchDownsides:- the app did logout of my profile unknowingly so that erased my data overtime (maybe I did something wrong here)",5.0
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I had a mi band 6 before this. The touch screen stopped responding after 3 years or so. To be fair, I was wearing it while working with spraying water and sludge, and I am hard on my watch. I am constantly banging it into things. I tried a 30 dollar knockoff smartwatch first as a replacement,  but it was too much fuss and irritation. I don't need to dial a phone number on my watch. Really all I was looking for was steps, heart rate,  time, and notifications.  The mi band 9 handles them all well. The screen is crisp and bright, easy to see in the sun or inside. Swiping on the screen works well.  You can select your own shortcuts to swipe left to. Notifications come over very quickly.  I have not noticed any extra battery drain. The vibration is perhaps a little lower than I would prefer, but it is enough to wake me up in the morning,  which I find much less irritating than the alarm on my phone. I would definitely recommend it. The only thing to see is if the new screen holds up as well as the old one, but there are screen protectors if needed.",5.0
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I'm a fan of the Xiaomi Smart Band. I used the Mi Band 5 and 7, and this time I bought the Mi Band 9. The app isn’t very intuitive, and the user guide for the Mi Band isn’t exactly easy to follow either. However, once I get used to the functions I want to use, the simplicity and lightweight comfort of the Mi Band make it the only one I end up using. The Mi Band 7 and 9 don’t seem to have changed much, but the 7 has been a great help to me over the past two years. The Mi Band 7 didn’t just stop working; it 'died in the line of duty,' having served me faithfully for two years before it passed away.I’ll tell you the story of how I first got introduced to the Mi Band. Back then, it was the Mi Band 5, but since the difference in features is not significant compared to the current Mi Band 9, it remains a useful reference before making a purchase.Company C’s warehouse somewhere in Asia—I worked 8 hours a day pulling a cart non-stop—literally no (official) break time. My job was to find the ordered items, load them up, and deliver them to the ladies who did the packing. The only time I could sit without worrying was during lunch. But being exhausted, full from eating, and sitting down? That’s a perfect recipe for dozing off every time. So, I decided to get myself a reliable alarm clock to keep me awake.I considered a $2 stopwatch from a dollar store (Daiso), but it got eliminated in the final round because changing the battery was a hassle. Instead, I ended up with a much pricier but fancier Mi Band 5. On the first day, I was just happy it told time accurately, but then I realized—it also counted my heartbeats while I was dozing off. Wow, new tech. But, seriously, why? At this point, it might as well have had a feature that automatically alerts a funeral home if my heart stops while I’m sleeping. Anyway, back to work I went.Here are my thoughts after using it for a few days—just personal impressions and some random questions. If you are already reading reviews, you probably know all the functions. So instead of a spec rundown, here’s how I actually use them:Sleep MonitoringIt sends something—electrical signals? Radio waves?—to my wrist at intervals I set (once every minute or every 10 minutes). The fact that only my wrist feels sore in the morning tells me I have clearly been in an inappropriate relationship with this gadget overnight. I don’t even use a microwave, and this doesn’t feel great. But it’s fascinating, so I give it two nights. Then it starts nagging me like my mom did 30 years ago: ""You went to bed too late. Sleep earlier. You didn’t get enough deep sleep."" It even logs the exact time I get up to use the bathroom. Now, that’s impressive.ExerciseThe only workout I do is running. I don’t have any heart conditions, so I never care about heart rate. But I do like that it tracks my distance. At my age, I need to brag about how far I can still run.Menstrual Cycle Tracking & AlertsI’m a guy.Battery Life & ChargingThe battery lasts forever. Charging is easy. No complaints.Stress MonitoringI already know when I’m stressed. Do I really need a watch to tell me? Also, it doesn’t seem to differentiate between stress, tension, and excitement—like the kind of excitement you get from certain situations, for example.Final ThoughtsIf you are old enough to need reading glasses to see this text, listen up: Mi Band 9’s font is tiny. If you just want the time displayed in big numbers, that’s fine, but cramming multiple bits of info on one screen? Forget it.It is packed with features, but let’s be real—who is actually going to check their sleep data every day for a year? Your sleep quality won’t improve just because you look at the numbers. And honestly, how many buyers really have serious arrhythmia concerns? Unless you do, heart rate tracking isn’t that useful. Also, if your phone is within reach, why would you squint at this tiny screen for texts or fumble with your fat fingers trying to change songs? That’s just comedy.It is basically a cute gadget watch. But!If you’ve read this far, you’re already too invested. Let’s be real—you’ll probably hit that ""Buy Now"" button tonight and go to bed pretending it never happened. Just get this over with, and stop thinking about your next purchase for now. Free yourself from the agony—buy it now, and move on.Objectively, just the watch and step tracker alone make it worth it. It also has a handy feature to help you find your phone. A solid, sleek, and not-too-cheap-looking digital watch for under $45? That’s not easy to find. And if playing around with its features makes you enjoy working out for a month or two, that alone justifies the price. For serious fitness folks, you might even discover more useful functions than I did.And when you get bored? Swap out the band (about $7) or trade it with your nephew for an Attack on Titan figurine, a popular anime character. It has a design that kids totally fall for.Good luck.",4.0

The size is right for me, the display is large and easy to read and there are plenty of watch faces to choose from. I'm not into sports or workouts so it's had light use so far. At just over two weeks it still has over 50 percent charge. I like the sleep tracker and heart rate monitor and the text and phone alerts have been useful. I've used the timer function too and it beats having to pull out my phone and go through the process of setting a timer on it. I swapped out the band it came with after wearing it a few days. I prefer the old-fashioned style that has a buckle and keeper loops to hold the free end. For under $50 I think it would be hard to find one that works this well. Set up was fast and easy, too.",5.0

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"As a former Fitbit and Samsung fitness watch wearer I am extremely pleased with this item. I get the same, if not more options,  than I did with my previous higher end watches for a fraction of the cost. The battery lasts for days and days. I can track sleep, heart rate, steps, get my text messages and app messages.  I'm still diving into everything it can do. The only drawbacks are it doesn't sync directly with any of my fitness apps but Samsung offers a backdoor way of syncing it's information via the Samsung health app on my phone. Another drawback is that it drains your phone battery much quicker due to the constant connection between the watch and phone. I just turn off the Bluetooth connection when I don't need the notifications from my phone pinged to my watch. However there's still a good bit of drain from the app even after this has been done.  Not a deal breaker but be aware and have charging options available when needed.",5.0
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I bought this because the old fitbit that I used at work broke. I have an Apple watch but then I don’t want to use it because I’m afraid it will end up being broken at work too (I already broke 2 Fitbit watches due to the nature of my work). And since it’s almost the same size as my fitbit, my husband recommended this brand. I usually don’t wear watch when I’m at home but now even after work, I’m still wearing it. I like how it tracks my sleep hours, steps and calories burned. My apple watch has too much apps that I don’t need, gets low batt easily, and it looks big for my small wrist (I got it as a gift). Xiaomi has the basic apps that I need making it battery efficient. I can go on days without charging it. I only charge it when I drive (30mins most of the time) and that’s enough to have it 100% charged. I love its size compared to my apple watch too. Not too wide. Just right for my wrist size. I sometimes forget that I’m wearing it. The straps are easy to put on with a snap. There’s a decent amount of display themes to choose from. The 2 downsides for me: 1. The brightness doesn’t adjust, so when it’s bedtime and I move my arm…tadaaa bright display coming up. 2. It doesn’t sync every time like my Apple watch. Sometimes I have to manually sync it using the app so my stats will record or the weather gets updated on the watch. But nonetheless, it’s still a 5 stars for me because I love the functionality and ease of use of this watch. Plus, it’s not pricy 😊",5.0
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"This is my first smartwatch, so I don't have any comparison. But I really love this watch, the design is simple and gives me information about my steps, calories and heart rate. I love that you can choose between a lot of workout options, and it even has boxing as an option. I think for a beginner watch, this is perfect. The battery lasts me about a week and the size is not too big and not too small for my liking.",5.0
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"Generally it covers almost all functions of a smart band, but not good for a sports tracking device such as Fitbit Charge 4 or Huawei’s Band 10 E93 which I bought for myself. It claims it has 21 day battery life, over two weeks of the Huawei band 10. What it adds thinness of a device supposedly thin and light. The steps it counts (4000’s) were much less than I actually runs (6000’s). The band is not flexible or soft enough. It vibrates often to give warnings of loosing GPS connections when I do swimming because my phone was left on the bench besides the pool, which was annoying during swimming. I know you can turn it silent. In all, it’s good for a smart band, especially at a fairly good price. The attached photos showed Xiaomi (pink) and Huawei band 10 (blue).",4.0

It tracks your sleep patterns pretty well, counts your steps and so much more.

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I bought this to replace my Galaxy Watch 5 (and a pink one to replace my girlfriend's Galaxy Watch 4), because we had to charge our watches every 14 hours or so and they were getting more sluggish by the month. I always like to break electronics down on a simple pros & cons list, so let's have at it (in alphabetical order)._:PROS:_- Battery life is superb. I could definitely see getting 3 weeks out of a charge if I turned off all the extra features. As it stands, I typically get at least 10 days with sleep tracking and AOD (always-on-display) turned on, (both of which the watch warns you will reduce battery life). Charging from ~10% to 100 only takes about 2 hours as well on a normal 1A charger.--- Battery optimization options also are excellent, such as ""smart AOD"" (turns the screen off when the watch detects you're sleeping or when the watch isn't on your wrist at all). They can easily be found in Settings (gear icon)->Battery or Display.- Exercise tracking has become very accurate after only TWO treadmill walks. There is an option at the end of walking or treadmill workouts to calibrate the distance traveled.--- I did not realize this until AFTER my first treadmill walk, so I set my next distance walk to 2.2 mi, which is VERY close to 3.22 km.----- It was over by about 200 meters, so I adjusted it to 3.22 and then my 3rd treadmill walk was within 0.01 km of my actual distance traveled, according to the treadmill, so I was very impressed by that.- Notifications come through quickly from your default apps (messages, phone calls, email) as well as any other app that can send notifications to your phone, like games, security camera apps, etc.--- Although pictures will not be displayed (MMS messages), texts with emojis do work.--- You cannot answer calls from the watch, but you can mute or reject them as caller ID does pop up.--- There is an option in the settings to deactivate notifications while your phone screen is unlocked, which is nice so you're not getting them in two places at once.- Screen and overall user interface is very responsive - I was slightly uneasy about buying a watch with no buttons at all, but the screen feels incredibly reliable.--- Also, there are a TON of different displays to switch to, simple Analog & Digital ones, as well as ones with more information and customizable ones into which you can insert pictures. This all feels great.- Size & Design are very appealing - the screen does not feel too large even for my girlfriend - it is the perfect size.- Sleep tracking with heart rate monitoring & REM tracking also feels pretty accurate. There is also an option to monitor night-time breathing rate, but that consumes more battery so I have not checked that off yet._:CONS:_- Firstly, as it goes with many electronics and apps, it feels like you are signing your life and naming rights of your firstborn child away upon setup, but there is an easy-to-find option in the section ""Profile->About this app"" to ""Revoke Authorization"" if you change your mind on how much data is collected.- Alarm app only allows you to ""snooze"" one time, then the alarm will not go off again until the next day, so you may need to set multiple alarms if you sleep through your first one, like I often do.- I cannot find out how to change the distance units from the default km; you are able to change the weather units from C to F, but I have not yet found the option to toggle km to miles if it exists.- Hiking & Walking programs: I do not believe there is a difference between these at all; this is not so much of a complaint, but on my older GPS-tracking watches, both programs would track your route. In addition, Hiking would also include changes in altitude, which I very much liked. So color me slightly disappointed to find, at the end of my hike, hills had not been accounted for. Again, minor thing overall, but that would have been nice to be included in the workout summary._:NEUTRALS:_- In regards to the app, it is overall easy to use and find things.- One odd thing is that the ""Workout"" section only contains 5 icon at the top (Outdoor running, Walking, Outdoor cycling, Treadmill & Jump Rope), but there are a TON more on the actual watch for other activities (aerobic / weight-training / swimming / etc.), just as a FYI...- (not the company's fault) but aftermarket it definitely lighter for bands than other mainstream smartwatches - I've gotten a couple cool magnetic claps ones around the $10 - $15 mark that are well worth it though.OVERALL, for under a hundred bucks, this definitely feels like the best tracker out there in terms of functionality, battery life, and usefulness. I consider myself pretty critical and my caveats are not even impactful enough to remove a star. Also, my girlfriend still raves about hers as well, so she still loves it and hasn't mentioned any of her own cons to me (and I have asked...).",5.0

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"Battery life is great and the, the face options are fun and plenty, and it feels comfortable on my wrist. My only star removal is due, in part, to the app. It's required to run all the time on the phone and it seems to eat the battery life. The battery lasts a long time, regardless, but that also means it can take a long time to charge back up when you need to. I used to charge my Fitbit watches (plural, thanks for crappy quality) while showering. I can't really do that with this unless I leave it charging after the shower is complete. No big deal, however, as it otherwise remains on my wrist all other times of the day.I was not expecting the app to properly sync with my Trainwell fitness app but, surprisingly, it did. It even had the GPS information and a lot of metrics during the run. I didn't even have to do anything to get Trainwell to see the run, it just sucked it right in like me with donuts!I will point out one annoyance, and I'm not 100% sure this is the watch and not Android, but whenever I have a voicemail waiting for me, any time the phone receives signal, where it didn't have signal before, the watch will buzz and show a notification for the pending voicemail. Between my office and parking spot, if there's a VM I know about it at least 3-times during my walk. I looked for a way to turn off certain apps from sending notifications, but either I got distracted or I couldn't find a way to restrict them. It also wants me to let it connect all the time and run in the background, but their instructions for doing that on Android is outdated or doesn't work with my phone cause it never works and constantly tells me to do the app permissions.For an inexpensive fitness tracker and watch, I think the quality more than exceeds the price!",4.0

Take my word for it.We tried a lot of other affordable smartwatches, but they all ended up being returned due to poor quality or performance issues. This one is a keeper.

Xiaomi Redmi Watch 5,"It arrived with 79% charge and lasted 11 days. I recharged it for the first time on 01/25 and I haven't needed to recharge it yet. Excellent product, it's meeting the purpose for which I bought it and, as a bonus, the battery life is excellent.",5.0

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"It works much better than I expected, it has many functions, it trachea the sleep, the calories, the exercises it has many types of workout to trachear I was afraid that it would not connect well to my iPhone but it was synchronized through its app, the sleep tracker measures when it is light, deep or rem, it also measures stress. Its charge is light that I liked the most it arrived with 60% charge and served me for 10 days and had all the functions active. Without a doubt,",5.0
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I bought this to replace my Fitbit Charge 5 that recently died, and while I've had it not quite a week I already love it.  Unlike my Fitbit, it has alerted me to high heart rates when I am standing instead of congratulating me on being active like the Fitbit did in the same situation.  Activity tracking is easy, and I haven't had any issues with bumping the tracker and accidentally stopping timers like I did with the Fitbit.  It has all the features I wanted, a few I wasn't looking for but that have been helpful (like being able to switch my phone to do not disturbfrom the tracker), and none of the extra stuff that I didn't want.  I really like how the image on the home screen can be changed, and I was impressed when it bumped yoga to the top of the exercise list after I tracked just one yoga routine. I wish the app could be connected to the fitness app I use, but that's my only complaint.  The app has also been easy to use.  Definitely more than worth the price.",5.0
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"i tend to dislike watches in general—all i wanted was the cheapest, smallest stopgap to keep an eye on my heart rate between my last screen-free ""smart jewelry"" fitness tracker dying and (someday) receiving the smart ring i've pre-ordered, but this xiaomi is actually pretty nice. there are lots of cute backgrounds, and i even get compliments on it!have not seen the battery run down hardly at all so far, i just pop it on the charger whenever i shower and that seems to be plenty to keep it going. i don't use mine very extensively, though (eg i don't let it receive my phone notifications), so ymmv by a lot. only leaving 4 stars because i can't actually speak to the accuracy or all the other things it does, but it's been great for my purposes. :)",4.0

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"Love this watch! Clear screen with functional display. Good battery life (almond a week), useful biometrics. My only complaint is that the app it uses, Mi Fitness,  doesn't sync with main fitness apps. It's not widely recognized, if at all. So I've lost all my regular exercise buddies 😕",5.0
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"This fitness band is effective, affordable and the best part is that the battery lasts quite a while. The only thing I don't like about the watch is related to the Mi Fitness app which only allows you to record your weight/height in kg/meters. Overall though Xiaomi made a really great product.",5.0

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"This is the 4th generation of Mi Bands I've had, beginning with Mi Band 5. I didn't really like the size switch (I think they made it bigger in gen 8) - as I really liked the slim band that you hardly knew was there. But, I have to say this band feels awfully sleek. And I don't really notice it that much.The band is really soft - they also appear to have made it a little thicker. As I did break 2 or 3 bands over the years, this is probably a good thing.The auto brightness is an awesome new feature - it was always a pain to adjust the watch for different lighting. Overall the look and feel of the operating system is definitely improved. I assume the heart rate tracking is as stellar as ever - Mi Band has always excelled in that area, and been very close to Apple in terms of accuracy. There's a guy on youtube from Germany or Switzerland who has a great technical comparison of different heart rate trackers, and Xiaomi Mi Bands have always done really well there.Sleep tracking has always been not quite as good - but still a lot better than most. For people like me who just want to know ""hey how many hours did I get last night"" this band will undoubtedly be pretty spot on. Deep diving on your REM, etc - it probably won't rival the top trackers.The biggest problem with the Xiaomi ecosystem has always been how crappy their fitness app has been. I used a 3rd party app for a long time. But the newest incarnation of the Mi Fit app that goes with this watch appears to have finally gotten it right. The app sort of gets out of the way, and gives you what you need pretty quickly. It appears to sync well, and works with things like Strava and Apple Health.I wish I could fine tune the watch OS a little more - and get rid of all the activities I don't do, and just have about 5 or 6. I don't really see a way to do that right now.But overall this watch feels like a pretty decent upgrade from the previous bands, including 8.Highly recommended - probably the best fitness tracker on the planet for the money.",5.0
Xiaomi Smart Band 9,I've had every single misfit since 3. This one by far is the best. Has all the features that you could ever want with the pricing that is still within the mi fit expectations. Fixed all the slump engineering of previous devices.I've had it since it first came out and I'm just now giving my two cents for reviewing it. I easily go 10 to 14 days between charges while not dialing much down for energy conservation.,5.0

Xiaomi Smart Band 9,"I got this watch for my partner and he had it paired with a Samsung phone. It has the Mi Fitness app. Originally, I would have given it 5 stars considering the price and functionality but the strap became loose and he ended up losing it when it fell off. We thought we could track the watch’s location via the Mi Fitness app but it strangely didn’t have that option. Also, the heart rate monitor doesn’t appear accurate in case this is something you want to track.",3.0

Xiaomi Redmi 5,"Although positioned as an entry-level player, the Redmi Watch 5 Active's sporty features are unambiguous. It supports 140 sports modes, including running, swimming (5ATM water resistance), cycling, etc., to meet my daily workout needs. The heart rate monitoring is very stable during exercise, and it can generate detailed reports with the Mi Sports app. The screen is bright enough outdoors and the operation is smooth, the only drawback is the lack of built-in GPS, which requires a mobile phone to assist in positioning. The watch face market is rich in choice, and you can customize the style you like. It's a great deal for people on a budget but want a versatile fitness watch!",5.0
Xiaomi Redmi 5,The watch itself is beyond the pricing point. The only reason for the 4 star is because the wrist band that comes with it is very difficult to put on. It tucks underneath itself on your wrist which is odd. Otherwise I'm more than impressed so far,4.0
Xiaomi Redmi 5,"As a budget-friendly smartwatch, the Redmi Watch 5 Active completely exceeded my expectations. What surprised me the most was its battery life - even with all-day heart rate monitoring and message notifications turned on, it can easily last for 7-10 days, completely free from the hassle of frequent charging. The 2-inch screen is clear enough to see in sunlight, and the touch is responsive. The sport mode is very useful, and I usually use step tracking and cycling monitoring, and the data accuracy is good. Although GPS is missing, it is possible to record the running route through a mobile phone connection. For a price of less than $70, this watch is definitely the king of value for money!",5.0
Xiaomi Redmi 5,"I have to praise it for its battery life! With round-the-clock heart rate and sleep monitoring turned on, it can still last 10 days of charging, which is much better than products in the same price range. The 1.96-inch AMOLED screen is clearly visible in sunlight, and the touch response is also very responsive. I am particularly satisfied with the blood oxygen detection function, which can warn of hypoxia in time when climbing the mountain. The 150 sport mode is perfectly capable of meeting my daily needs. As a daily health monitoring device, this price point is perfect!",5.0
Xiaomi Redmi 5,"This is a nice functional watch. The plastic housing is a bit chunky compared to other aluminum models, but at this price that is to be expected. The screen is nice and bright. I have no problem reading it in the Arizona sun. The colors are vivid and lines are crisp. The display detects wrist tilt and turns on and off reliably when you lift your arm to read it. It syncs with my phone reliably and I get notifications on it as well. It was a bit of a pain to sort out the app permissions, but once that was done it works well. You can configure your home screen pages to include shortcuts to favorite activities, stats, music controls, timers, etc. There's a wide variety of faces available from minimalist to information overload. Battery life is great, with 5-7 days being standard for me. The factory strap is a bit of a pain to put on, but it uses standard watch straps with quick release pins, so any generic 22mm strap should fit. Heart rate and SpO2 monitoring seem accurate, and it detects activity well. There are a couple things I wish were different. Weight and height are in metric only, so if you're tracking weight loss you'll need to convert each time. The contacts for phone calls don't work. I can see my contacts, but the watch is unable to use them to dial a call. Manual keypad dialing does work though, oddly enough. There is no auto brightness on this model, so it can be a bit bright in dark rooms. It will sync night mode with local sunrise and sunset though, which helps. There are some cool geared/steampunk style mechanical faces available, but they are static. Outside of analog hand movement, there are no animations available. Overall, this offers a lot of functionality and is a solid choice at a great price point.",4.0
Xiaomi Redmi 5,"The Redmi Watch 5 Active is the most hassle-free smart watches I've ever bought. The appearance is simple, and it can be adapted to business or leisure scenes with various straps. The Bluetooth call function is very convenient, and the vibration feedback is gentle and unobtrusive. The battery life is excellent and the charging speed is fast (about 2 hours to fully charge). The downside is that there is less support for third-party apps, but it's perfectly sufficient for users who only need basic smart features. Super cost-effective, recommended for those who pursue pragmatism!",5.0
Xiaomi Redmi 5,"Nice Watch The smartwatch is beyond my imagination, with a very smooth screen swipe and a custom watch face feature that allows me to change the style every day.

Xiaomi Redmi 5,"First, this is a great budget-friendly active smart watch. The large LCD display is very nice, and I appreciated the different display options you could use. It's very easy to use and set up. My main reason for getting this watch was for running. I tested this product for a week, and due to my needs, it was not sufficient (aka tracking my run).In regards to running, it took a while to acquire the GPS, and while running, I was consistently notified of a 'low signal'. I have a running partner, and we would compare our data, and it was not the same. The majority of my runs will track the mileage, but it cannot track the location (aka provide the map visual [Strava]) due to the 'low signal'. Also, if you are from the US, this device uses the metric system (e.g., kilometers), and you cannot change it (I tried). Due to this, I returned the device.Overall, I would recommend it for the day-to-day and basic health tracking, but NOT for those who are active and track mileage.",4.0

Xiaomi Redmi Watch 4,"I have had a number of smartwatches including several different Fitbits and I like this the best of all I have tried.  I have been using this watch for several months now.  Most everything about the watch is excellent.  Set up was easy. I gave it only four stars because the sleep tracking seems inaccurate, missing most of the awake time. Also, the auto detection of workouts just takes too long to detect that you are working out.  But, the step counting, GPS, heart rate, SPO2, music control, phone functions all are very good.  I do wish that you could see distance in miles as opposed to kilometers and that you could reply to text messages (you can see the message but not reply).  I love the beautiful large display; the amazing battery life and how quick it charges; and its flawless touch sensitivity and operation.  All in all, I am very happy with this watch.  And yes, the watch band was not very convenient as other owners have reported but you can purchase a variety of different bands that attach very easily on TEMU, AliExpress, or Amazon.  I bought several bands that I love.",4.0

Xiaomi Redmi Watch 4,"This watch is actually pretty darn good. The features are good, it looks awesome, there are tons of watch faces available, it auto detects your workout, the battery life is great, you can customize the cards, you can answer your phone on it, it seems fairly accurate with vitals, I mean for the value, it's pretty awesome!So why only 1 star?1. You can't change units of measurement from metric to imperial units2. It does connect to Google fit, but it's very inconsistent. Every once in a while the heartrate will transfer over, but it'll only transfer a very small data set, and then it won't transfer again for hours or days, even if I try to manually sync.I love all the good features, but this negative ones outweigh everything else. I reached out to the manufacturer about it, literally got zero response. Very disappointing because I have purchased 6 of their phones in the past, and some other devices from them.",1.0
